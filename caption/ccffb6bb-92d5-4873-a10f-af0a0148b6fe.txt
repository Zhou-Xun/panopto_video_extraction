1
00:00:00,630 --> 00:00:28,500
Okay. Even though I would agree with you, this is very exciting and I'm so happy that we're doing something and I just, you know, it's terrible.

2
00:00:31,860 --> 00:00:40,200
Yeah, well, it might have been good for you.

3
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:45,150
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Just part of the sentence.

4
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:51,990
So I. I don't know if I want to.

5
00:00:52,020 --> 00:00:55,030
I don't know if Jo Jo was helping with the car situation.

6
00:00:55,100 --> 00:01:00,980
Oh, I just spoke with him. Oh, really?

7
00:01:03,940 --> 00:01:06,990
I didn't think so.

8
00:01:10,140 --> 00:01:15,400
Well, yeah.

9
00:01:15,510 --> 00:01:27,810
Plus, you really, you know, it's just so I could see.

10
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:34,380
Yeah, I think I can tell you something that's never happened before.

11
00:01:34,900 --> 00:01:38,160
Yeah. What did you say based on your.

12
00:01:39,740 --> 00:01:45,910
Like, I don't know. Yeah, I'm sure there's a business which I tried to set up.

13
00:01:46,950 --> 00:01:52,910
I did. And I really don't have much in common with.

14
00:01:53,820 --> 00:02:03,959
Okay, I'm going to get started to get a little bit of the problems severe getting out she has been so few

15
00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:13,700
logistics so far is due on Wednesday this Wednesday is also the Wednesday will deliver it basically or

16
00:02:13,710 --> 00:02:22,200
you can go on and I've asked to canvas to everybody for today's evaluation to instead of asking you a

17
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:29,309
question about dislikes your question or to you about the semester about basically about exam three,

18
00:02:29,310 --> 00:02:32,480
which as I mentioned, it's not humor is bad, it's good.

19
00:02:33,030 --> 00:02:37,079
That doesn't mean, you know, the information that you've learned is cumulative.

20
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:42,090
So there could be some answers that are relevant to the first two thirds of the class.

21
00:02:42,090 --> 00:02:45,960
So it'll be an informal session on Wednesday.

22
00:02:46,230 --> 00:02:49,920
I might have you get into small groups to kind of just fill some of the questions

23
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:55,140
or better so that we can get through some of the any kind of questions you have.

24
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:04,230
Any questions on that? The take home is going to be due on the 12.

25
00:03:06,660 --> 00:03:12,880
It looks a little bit like. Combination of homework and the exams you had.

26
00:03:12,900 --> 00:03:18,780
It'll be that. It'll be all short answer. You'll be looking at a manuscript also.

27
00:03:19,650 --> 00:03:24,250
So. Any question for you guys?

28
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:25,630
Good to go. Okay.

29
00:03:25,870 --> 00:03:34,270
So I'd like to introduce our guest to the professor associate professor in the Department of English in at Michigan State University.

30
00:03:35,500 --> 00:03:47,710
He has authored this book, the column My Work, called the Cold War Horse Flu Chloroform in the Science of Medicine The Life of John Snow.

31
00:03:48,430 --> 00:03:53,080
And I brought Steve in because he's an expert in John Snow,

32
00:03:53,380 --> 00:04:01,330
and he's going to give us a historical perspective of how we understand and know through epidemiology,

33
00:04:01,330 --> 00:04:06,880
our basic science, our ability to understand concepts in theory.

34
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:12,880
And I think one thing that I've tried to do in this course is emphasize the importance of theory in public health.

35
00:04:13,300 --> 00:04:17,050
We've talked about transmission systems and the importance of transmission systems

36
00:04:17,050 --> 00:04:22,590
and thinking about understanding the epidemiology of infectious diseases.

37
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:24,040
We brought in Jim Troxel,

38
00:04:24,670 --> 00:04:34,120
who gave us a social science perspective and his theory is a in social science used to think about the epidemiology of infectious diseases.

39
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:41,020
We brought in honest everybody knew hottest the populace to think about that theory from a perspective of biology.

40
00:04:41,470 --> 00:04:51,670
So here we have somebody from the humanities giving us a historical perspective of thinking about how we're presenting

41
00:04:51,670 --> 00:04:59,950
a way in which we should be thinking about how we learn and understand the epidemiology of infectious diseases.

42
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:07,750
So with that, thanks, Joe. Good morning.

43
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:13,570
Yes, I'm going to talk about we do have a major but present event.

44
00:05:15,950 --> 00:05:19,220
You know how loud one is. Yeah, that's what you have to.

45
00:05:21,830 --> 00:05:25,070
So. It was a little lovely, I.

46
00:05:27,970 --> 00:05:36,770
Ten, just. Near the top.

47
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:53,180
How's that? Better. All right. Good. Yeah.

48
00:05:53,210 --> 00:06:01,250
So the title of this talk is Severe Induction John Snow in Theories of Cholera in the 19th Century.

49
00:06:01,940 --> 00:06:05,720
And I'm going to speak to you about Jon Snow. One of the things that's.

50
00:06:07,650 --> 00:06:11,120
I wear a couple of hats in terms of my own work.

51
00:06:11,130 --> 00:06:18,210
I'm in an English department, but I was the director of American Studies and I have a kind of interest in literature and the history of medicine.

52
00:06:18,450 --> 00:06:23,310
And that's how I came by root of this. Maybe a little bit of background that is interesting, too.

53
00:06:23,850 --> 00:06:32,670
I was doing a dissertation back in the 1980s and I was really interested in theories of disease and theories of creativity.

54
00:06:33,300 --> 00:06:39,030
And I came upon Jon Snow actually through anesthesia because he was one of the few

55
00:06:39,030 --> 00:06:44,610
19th century investigators who didn't seem to have class prejudices about anesthesia.

56
00:06:44,850 --> 00:06:49,170
If you look at the history of anesthesia and at the University of Michigan,

57
00:06:49,290 --> 00:06:55,560
maybe I'll pay tribute to Martin Koenig, who was one of the great historians of medicine here in 97.

58
00:06:56,070 --> 00:07:03,479
I usually when I start my career, I think he's retired. And Marty Koenig wrote a book on it as the year end.

59
00:07:03,480 --> 00:07:10,440
And what he showed in his studies was just how much social prejudice there was in looking at a medical phenomenon.

60
00:07:12,100 --> 00:07:17,590
If you were African-American, you thought, well, you're constitutionally not susceptible to use the issue.

61
00:07:17,860 --> 00:07:23,980
If you were a woman, you might have a constitutional in susceptibility if you were a laborer.

62
00:07:24,430 --> 00:07:28,149
They felt they didn't have it. John Snow had none of those things.

63
00:07:28,150 --> 00:07:33,520
He he just looked at the chemistry of it and he figured out that the reason people were getting

64
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:39,410
varying reactions to anesthesia was they were not able to control the doses of volatiles.

65
00:07:39,430 --> 00:07:47,290
In those days, it was mostly inhalants, so ether chloroform or the two big ones, nitrous oxide to a lesser extent.

66
00:07:47,620 --> 00:07:55,269
And I was fascinated by a figure who seemed to be without prejudice in regard to social

67
00:07:55,270 --> 00:08:01,150
behaviors and using those in his theories of understanding a phenomenon like anesthesia,

68
00:08:01,450 --> 00:08:12,330
which was very mysterious at the time, it seemed to be a place between sleep and death and dreaming, but it was a wholly other phenomenon.

69
00:08:12,340 --> 00:08:16,900
So new phenomena was something immediately brought me to John Snow's work.

70
00:08:16,910 --> 00:08:22,389
Even though I was in American history, I was looking for what people were thinking about in those days.

71
00:08:22,390 --> 00:08:25,300
So he was immediately an interesting person to me.

72
00:08:25,960 --> 00:08:32,710
When I came to Michigan State, I met a group of people who knew nothing about his anesthesia work but were obsessed with his cholera work.

73
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:46,180
And we began basically a five year running seminar thinking about everything about John Snow, the result of which was the book that Joe mentioned and.

74
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:51,610
But see. Including.

75
00:08:52,910 --> 00:08:58,240
Yeah. So here's here is a man in a kind of classic Victorian pose.

76
00:08:58,250 --> 00:09:07,790
We don't have a lot of pictures of him. There he is by this point in his career, a a gentleman physician in London, already successful.

77
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:14,570
And and this is kind of how he appears to us, but he comes from a working class background.

78
00:09:15,140 --> 00:09:20,090
He was born in 1813. He died in 1858.

79
00:09:20,960 --> 00:09:23,210
So he only lived to be 45 years, maybe.

80
00:09:24,860 --> 00:09:32,480
And in that short but eventful life, he became a foundational figure in the history and development of the Asia.

81
00:09:33,350 --> 00:09:38,450
And basically the foundational figure in what we think of as modern epidemiology.

82
00:09:38,930 --> 00:09:50,210
And for any human being to achieve that kind of level of innovation and contribution is thank you for doing that.

83
00:09:53,810 --> 00:09:59,240
On that basis, I relax. Okay. But, you know, it's extraordinary.

84
00:09:59,390 --> 00:10:03,300
It's absolutely unprecedented. But but to do it in short life.

85
00:10:05,150 --> 00:10:13,760
And because he's a foundational figure, as with nations and with medical fields, mythologies grow around them.

86
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:19,490
One of the things about the history of medicine is that medicine is constantly erasing history.

87
00:10:20,300 --> 00:10:22,820
I don't know how much history you get in a class like this.

88
00:10:22,820 --> 00:10:32,209
It's so important for you to know the latest and best information that we tend to, you know, go to the incident in the back of the book.

89
00:10:32,210 --> 00:10:36,210
Just this is what central fact. This is what we know. This is the best information about it.

90
00:10:36,470 --> 00:10:40,730
But as the recent pandemic and and your careers, if you go on in public health,

91
00:10:41,030 --> 00:10:47,540
will certainly show you what you're often dealing with is not medical certainty, but.

92
00:10:48,860 --> 00:10:52,550
Crises. Uncertainty. Partial truth.

93
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:56,960
Qualified truth. Debate. Speculation about these things.

94
00:10:56,970 --> 00:11:05,720
And so in order to understand Jon Snow's achievement, like we do with our nations or other other forms of social memory,

95
00:11:06,050 --> 00:11:11,240
we mythologize them and we reduced them to kind of a simple message.

96
00:11:11,480 --> 00:11:15,350
So I don't know how much you've heard about Jon Snow before you took this class.

97
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:24,710
You might think of him only as some name associated with Game of Thrones or, you know, some popular culture idea.

98
00:11:25,670 --> 00:11:30,920
But if you're if he's known to any of you, it's generally because he's the guy with the pump handle.

99
00:11:31,580 --> 00:11:36,680
There's a story and I'll be talking about it today that he in 1854,

100
00:11:36,680 --> 00:11:43,700
there's an outbreak of cholera in in London, in Soho and Golden Square and the Broad Street area.

101
00:11:43,910 --> 00:11:49,330
And there's a pump that is suspected to be the source of that outbreak.

102
00:11:49,340 --> 00:11:53,300
And Jon Snow is known as the man who removed the handle from the Broad Street.

103
00:11:53,720 --> 00:12:01,070
So if you ever get to go to London, I highly recommend it. You can go to Broad Street or Broadway Street, as it's known there.

104
00:12:01,400 --> 00:12:08,570
And there's the Jon Snow Pub, and you'll see a painted version of this photograph above the pub called the Jon Snow.

105
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:14,090
And it's right at the corner where the actual pub stood.

106
00:12:14,090 --> 00:12:24,710
And then across the street they've created a memorial pub without a handle and a tribute to him for the public service that he did there.

107
00:12:26,660 --> 00:12:33,440
Now, the story of just told you is the mythological one. He didn't actually remove the handle from the pump.

108
00:12:33,470 --> 00:12:37,160
He requested that the parish do this.

109
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:46,010
And I think that little detail is very important. And when I get to the end, we'll talk about the myths surrounding.

110
00:12:46,170 --> 00:12:55,820
I had you read a small essay from The Lancet that my colleagues wrote years ago about the mythologies around snow and the and the reasons for that.

111
00:12:56,960 --> 00:13:05,060
So in order to understand his intellectual, medical, sociological,

112
00:13:05,330 --> 00:13:13,010
physiological and social sort of context, the achievement of what he's really known for,

113
00:13:13,010 --> 00:13:21,830
of course, is propounding a theory that cholera was transmitted by contaminated drinking water through an oral fecal route.

114
00:13:22,460 --> 00:13:30,470
And it's that theory, and it was at the level of the theory that he is really remembered for.

115
00:13:31,610 --> 00:13:36,800
But as much as he's remembered for being correct and his correctness, of course, is important,

116
00:13:37,310 --> 00:13:40,970
even if he weren't correct and he is entirely correct about everything,

117
00:13:41,300 --> 00:13:48,050
about his thinking in these ways, no human is entirely correct about everything ever right.

118
00:13:48,170 --> 00:13:52,880
You know, nobody is all right all the time, as Bob Dylan might say.

119
00:13:53,990 --> 00:13:59,360
And you have this kind of sense that what we remember here and what we should think about is

120
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:06,680
not just how he arrived at the correctness through the chaos and the debates over cholera,

121
00:14:07,160 --> 00:14:14,720
but also the methods that he arrived at to achieve that correctness and the different levels on which he's thinking.

122
00:14:15,380 --> 00:14:22,940
This is a school of public health, and I think that public health is such an interesting and powerful phrase that we kind of take for granted,

123
00:14:23,390 --> 00:14:29,360
like what is the notion of public health and what kind of imagination does it take to think

124
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:35,340
about the public and then also think about the wellbeing and the health of that public.

125
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:39,920
And those two ideas are ones that I'm concerned shuttle between.

126
00:14:40,100 --> 00:14:49,100
And to show you what I think is important about Jon Snow's achievement and.

127
00:14:50,750 --> 00:14:59,150
In order to do that, I guess we have to go back in time and we have to think about outmoded notions of disease transmission.

128
00:15:01,250 --> 00:15:06,640
And that's part of what the history of medicine does. And what's so interesting, if you go into the history of medicine, is you realize.

129
00:15:07,750 --> 00:15:13,600
Many people got it wrong. Extremely brilliant and extremely learned.

130
00:15:14,140 --> 00:15:17,300
And they bring all the force of their knowledge to it.

131
00:15:17,320 --> 00:15:25,130
They just happened to not be correct. And we often think that the smartest people get it right.

132
00:15:26,500 --> 00:15:31,210
And what's so interesting is they know these are all really smart, is all really well informed,

133
00:15:31,540 --> 00:15:36,100
but they're working from the theories that they've received, and that's what humans do.

134
00:15:36,370 --> 00:15:43,750
We only learn from what we know. So in order to understand the journey that he travels, we have to know where he started.

135
00:15:44,770 --> 00:15:51,160
So what was cholera in? Jon Snow to stay on.

136
00:15:54,430 --> 00:16:00,040
Here are some images. You know, as we know today.

137
00:16:05,070 --> 00:16:12,720
Cholera is a disease that's transmitted by a bacterium Vibrio, and it has a little wiggly deal on it.

138
00:16:14,100 --> 00:16:21,930
And that idea became settled by the late 19th century after Pasteur.

139
00:16:22,110 --> 00:16:30,270
Really, it's color. And color is the great for bacteriologist, who basically ingests cholera himself,

140
00:16:30,580 --> 00:16:38,309
reproduces it, takes the excreta from his own body, dies it makes a slide and shows.

141
00:16:38,310 --> 00:16:41,400
Yes. See, I have proven that this was taken into my system.

142
00:16:41,670 --> 00:16:49,830
It came out of my system. And it's not really until the late 19th century that we get a bacteriological sense of, here's the agent.

143
00:16:51,320 --> 00:17:01,340
At the time when cholera started to really come in waves in the 19th century and the first big wave is 1830 132.

144
00:17:02,210 --> 00:17:14,810
There are lots of little outbreaks in between. Then there's another big wave in 1848, 49, then 1854, 53, 54, and then 1866.

145
00:17:15,870 --> 00:17:22,670
And then it's it still, of course, happens. But basically it's a.

146
00:17:25,810 --> 00:17:30,250
The waves of it seem to be kind of ominous, terrifying.

147
00:17:31,030 --> 00:17:35,860
There was this sense of it was going around the world. Nobody could stop it.

148
00:17:37,150 --> 00:17:42,910
I'm a student of literature and my other hat said it where I'm known as an expert on Edgar Allan Poe.

149
00:17:43,270 --> 00:17:47,290
He probably wrote the greatest pandemic story ever written The Mask of the Red

150
00:17:47,290 --> 00:17:53,980
Death or stylized story about death coming from room to room to room to coat.

151
00:17:54,460 --> 00:18:01,900
Poe experience cholera. He was alive. He dies in the time of the last cholera epidemic of 49.

152
00:18:02,200 --> 00:18:11,170
He's born in 1809. He's aware of it. But that sense of a disease moving from room to room to room is precisely what the world felt with cholera.

153
00:18:12,040 --> 00:18:19,870
If you were in England, as John Snow was like, Oh, there's a report of the cholera in Moscow next week.

154
00:18:20,050 --> 00:18:24,250
There's a report of the cholera in Berlin. Now it's in Vienna.

155
00:18:24,580 --> 00:18:29,590
Now it's in Paris. Now it's in London. Now it's in Baltimore.

156
00:18:29,920 --> 00:18:36,970
Now it's in New York. Now it's going across the United States to the gold fields of California.

157
00:18:37,870 --> 00:18:43,360
Of course, cholera is endemic to the Indian Ocean and Asia.

158
00:18:43,750 --> 00:18:47,710
It's endemic there where the waters are warm enough for it to live year round.

159
00:18:48,670 --> 00:18:51,460
But it seemed to come in these kinds of waves.

160
00:18:52,300 --> 00:19:00,190
And it was terrifying because you could be perfectly healthy in the morning and you could be dead by noon or the evening.

161
00:19:01,780 --> 00:19:07,380
We know today that it's a disease of dehydration.

162
00:19:07,390 --> 00:19:20,620
Basically, the cholera gets into the gut of the victim and radically dehydrates patient and they evacuate through what they call his rice water,

163
00:19:20,620 --> 00:19:24,430
basically severe diarrhea. And they die from dehydration.

164
00:19:25,900 --> 00:19:33,490
That's how it works. That's how it spreads. It needs constant sources of bodies and water to sort of transmit itself.

165
00:19:35,320 --> 00:19:42,310
And then in the 19th century, they saw these blue bodies.

166
00:19:43,540 --> 00:19:47,260
They called it the blue death. In some places, they saw.

167
00:19:51,530 --> 00:19:59,770
This is sort of a famous image from Paris. I love this particular one because you see the horror on the faces of the people

168
00:20:00,020 --> 00:20:05,150
and it's the kind of indifference of the dog sort of in the foreground there,

169
00:20:05,480 --> 00:20:08,770
sort of this idea that something's going on in nature.

170
00:20:08,790 --> 00:20:14,059
The people are terrified by this disease and this idea of the stricken body here.

171
00:20:14,060 --> 00:20:21,470
It's a young person, sort of poetic, looking romantic and quite dead and the blueness.

172
00:20:23,390 --> 00:20:27,920
This is just today. This still exists. This is from the World Health Organization.

173
00:20:28,310 --> 00:20:32,480
This is basically how cholera patients looked.

174
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:42,050
And you can sort of see there's a continuity between our own. This is only from what, 2012, I think sun doesn't look very much different from.

175
00:20:43,180 --> 00:20:51,850
Stylized imagery of the 19th century. The idea of how it strikes and how terrifying it is.

176
00:20:53,380 --> 00:21:01,690
This this kind of terror led to the kinds of panics you would see.

177
00:21:01,720 --> 00:21:06,580
I mean, we still haven't figured out, if you remember, but 2020, among other things,

178
00:21:06,580 --> 00:21:14,460
will be remembered for the great toilet paper hoarding, you know, a behavior this.

179
00:21:15,560 --> 00:21:20,510
It's probably appropriate in relationship to cholera, but but the idea of we still haven't closed that.

180
00:21:20,510 --> 00:21:25,070
Why when you know the rubber hits the road and the panic sets in,

181
00:21:25,430 --> 00:21:30,650
Americans all decide that the first thing they need to do is stock up on infinite amounts of toilet roll.

182
00:21:32,330 --> 00:21:40,700
But but that kind of panic is actually very common when we think about pandemics and endemic behavior that the lens of suspicion,

183
00:21:40,910 --> 00:21:47,590
that panicking flashlight in the dark corridor where you think there, there, there, there, there's the entity, there's the thing.

184
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:57,770
What's the solution? The same thing was sort of striking all over the Western world collar phobia floating in this fashion

185
00:21:57,770 --> 00:22:05,330
way where they're they're people are coming in for remedies and they're all looking for camphor.

186
00:22:05,570 --> 00:22:12,350
So spirits of wine and mustard basically can't do, you know,

187
00:22:12,350 --> 00:22:25,010
camphor as you probably know it today as mothballs, you know, or the idea to anyone have mothballs anymore.

188
00:22:25,910 --> 00:22:33,440
You know, you put them in your in your cedar chest heat to prevent moths from eating your your sweaters.

189
00:22:33,740 --> 00:22:42,500
And this idea of camphor like a strong odor that would it's a strong smelling sort of powerful thing.

190
00:22:42,500 --> 00:22:50,450
So they're looking for things that are cleaning agents because this is actually not nonsense that they're speaking here,

191
00:22:50,450 --> 00:22:58,370
but they're operating on a theory that cholera spread through my ASMs or my asthma and my asms are

192
00:22:58,970 --> 00:23:05,030
disease causing agents that are spread through decaying matter into the air in a sort of general sense.

193
00:23:05,030 --> 00:23:09,019
And I'll get into talking about why people are reacting in this particular way.

194
00:23:09,020 --> 00:23:14,959
And so just like in the times of the plague, ever seen those old plague masks?

195
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:18,080
The doctors were right. They had a very long beak on them.

196
00:23:18,080 --> 00:23:31,610
If you were from Italy especially. And what they would do was put a little sachet of strong smelling things, either vinegar or maybe cinnamon cloves,

197
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:39,440
strong scents, to sort of protect themselves against what they thought of as the miasma as they were spreading the plague.

198
00:23:39,740 --> 00:23:48,469
Same idea here. They're thinking, if I take in a strong smelling substance, somewhat toxic sort of kind of substance.

199
00:23:48,470 --> 00:24:01,070
You know, there was somebody who recommended fluorescent light as a particular way of curing COVID in a particularly disgusting manner.

200
00:24:01,070 --> 00:24:08,270
But but that's the same idea. It's a very old idea. It's like, let me take something toxic or something very strong smelling,

201
00:24:08,450 --> 00:24:15,770
and that will inoculate or protect me against something that I think is out there in the air and it's being spread by the air.

202
00:24:16,520 --> 00:24:19,430
And this is from 1831 London.

203
00:24:19,790 --> 00:24:26,750
But just looking at that, you know, the boon that chemists were enjoying as people are rushing in to try and protect themselves from cholera.

204
00:24:31,620 --> 00:24:40,800
Here's another cartoon of this is. This is from France with a man telling two women of his way to avoid cholera,

205
00:24:41,250 --> 00:24:44,550
which seems to be about eating and drinking and maybe some kind of lechery.

206
00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:48,570
It's a satire there where people are being taken advantage.

207
00:24:52,180 --> 00:25:00,610
This is another satire. I like these political cartoons where the doctors basically have the cholera patient bundled up.

208
00:25:01,060 --> 00:25:07,660
He's the one in the middle there with the pale face, and he's all tied up while they're looking at his stool.

209
00:25:07,870 --> 00:25:12,400
They're looking at his pants. They're looking everywhere. The doctors are looking everywhere for answers.

210
00:25:13,750 --> 00:25:18,430
Meanwhile, the patients kind of sort of languishing. They're suffering bound up.

211
00:25:18,730 --> 00:25:26,140
There's a lot of humoral medicine going on in this imagery here where the word cholera.

212
00:25:26,950 --> 00:25:33,830
Does anyone know where it comes from? The ancient humors.

213
00:25:35,420 --> 00:25:43,670
In ancient Greek medicine, there are four human right and four elements, and they're combined together.

214
00:25:43,670 --> 00:25:47,960
So the four elements are Earth, air, Earth, fire and water.

215
00:25:48,320 --> 00:25:51,680
And four humors are blood.

216
00:25:54,540 --> 00:26:00,770
Black bile. Yellow bile and phlegm and.

217
00:26:02,990 --> 00:26:07,370
So if you have a disposition where you're slow, you're considered phlegmatic.

218
00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:11,180
Meaning phlegm is gooey stuff that doesn't move.

219
00:26:12,650 --> 00:26:22,250
And so they had this sense here, well, the yellow bile was the one that was known to be Coller or Kola, as it's sometimes referred to.

220
00:26:22,460 --> 00:26:25,220
And that meant that you had a kind of fiery temperament.

221
00:26:26,090 --> 00:26:33,710
And so there was this kind of sense that cholera was kind of a raging sort of condition in the body.

222
00:26:34,430 --> 00:26:39,919
And so the disease kind of gets its name from that ancient humoral notion that, oh,

223
00:26:39,920 --> 00:26:48,410
this is something that's spread through the atmosphere and that somehow it's being transmitted to people.

224
00:26:48,740 --> 00:26:52,760
But here you just see that kind of chaos of the doctors really not having a good idea yet.

225
00:26:52,770 --> 00:26:57,200
They're looking everywhere. And that's the world that Jon Snow enters into.

226
00:26:57,890 --> 00:27:04,730
It's also interesting to look at. This is the London Board of Health being criticized for the same kind of thing.

227
00:27:05,140 --> 00:27:11,390
You know, instead of looking at the patient looking everywhere, they're looking everywhere.

228
00:27:11,420 --> 00:27:14,990
Oh, it's in the dirt. It's in bad smells. It's in the sewer.

229
00:27:16,190 --> 00:27:20,940
And again, I love the animal commentary here that it's a little pig.

230
00:27:21,040 --> 00:27:26,360
It's kind of like Charlotte's Web. Little pig. They're looking up at you, doctors.

231
00:27:27,800 --> 00:27:35,150
We hope that the animals are curious about this medical behavior, the kind of confusion that's going on there.

232
00:27:36,110 --> 00:27:42,919
So this is kind of 1831 when Jon Snow is a young apprentice, medical apprentice.

233
00:27:42,920 --> 00:27:49,400
He he comes from Yorkshire. He's born up in the northern part of England, in York to a working class family.

234
00:27:50,510 --> 00:27:55,489
And he apprentices in Newcastle in 1831 as a medical apprentice.

235
00:27:55,490 --> 00:28:00,920
He's obviously a bright boy, a family. He's one of eight surviving children.

236
00:28:01,370 --> 00:28:05,240
And he he goes to Newcastle.

237
00:28:05,300 --> 00:28:07,760
Newcastle is known as coal mining region.

238
00:28:07,970 --> 00:28:15,080
It's an old expression that nobody uses in or close to Newcastle, which means you're bringing something to a place that produces a lot of it.

239
00:28:16,130 --> 00:28:20,390
And he worked as a medical apprentice there in 1831, 32.

240
00:28:20,930 --> 00:28:25,160
He's a young man. He he has his first encounter with cholera.

241
00:28:25,550 --> 00:28:30,170
He goes into the mines and he sees the cholera that's infecting the miners.

242
00:28:31,460 --> 00:28:35,870
And mines are a great source for cholera to spread Newcastle because it's a port.

243
00:28:36,170 --> 00:28:44,870
So cholera comes in through the port and then it spreads to the mines because in the mines they all have to share drinking water and they also share.

244
00:28:46,910 --> 00:28:53,870
Crew toilet facility, shall we call it? Right. Mine is that this is a perfect sort of breeding ground for sort of cholera.

245
00:28:53,870 --> 00:28:58,310
So she sees it up front in 1831, 32. That's his first encounter with it.

246
00:28:58,970 --> 00:29:03,680
But he's not prepared to have a theory about it, not prepared to investigate it.

247
00:29:05,870 --> 00:29:08,900
And just a couple more images here here's.

248
00:29:13,040 --> 00:29:19,589
This is actually an image of. Collar trampling the victors and the vanquished.

249
00:29:19,590 --> 00:29:24,290
Both is what it was called. So warfare brought a lot.

250
00:29:24,330 --> 00:29:27,840
Just like refugee conditions. Warfare brings cholera.

251
00:29:28,290 --> 00:29:38,159
And here they realize that, you know, that more people die of disease than of wounds in in a lot of warfare.

252
00:29:38,160 --> 00:29:44,399
And they realize here these are kind of post Napoleonic wars in 1830 was where

253
00:29:44,400 --> 00:29:49,710
you see commentary about how many of the soldiers are dying of cholera here,

254
00:29:50,250 --> 00:29:56,520
that shadow of death there now again into some of the theory part of it.

255
00:29:58,810 --> 00:30:00,550
Here's a table for.

256
00:30:02,740 --> 00:30:11,170
Between 1831 and 1855, the kind of period of John Snow's acquaintance with cholera, his investigations of it, and his conclusions about it.

257
00:30:11,560 --> 00:30:17,980
These are some of the technical terms that were being used to describe cholera, because cholera could be used.

258
00:30:18,280 --> 00:30:22,030
Just sort of like to think of any kind of diarrhea you might have.

259
00:30:22,210 --> 00:30:25,630
People were very commonly getting diaries in the summer in particular,

260
00:30:25,630 --> 00:30:31,030
so you'd have summer cholera or English cholera, and that was in the cholera that killed you.

261
00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:34,750
It's just basically someone who's tone is out of sorts.

262
00:30:36,100 --> 00:30:39,220
And but they use the word algae.

263
00:30:41,080 --> 00:30:45,090
Algae. Sure. That's because the dehydration.

264
00:30:46,420 --> 00:30:49,540
Shivering and blueness Asiatic.

265
00:30:49,660 --> 00:30:55,040
It's the word came from the suffix heel. They seemed to be suffocating from it.

266
00:30:55,090 --> 00:30:58,420
That's another sense of that ballooning epidemic.

267
00:30:58,510 --> 00:31:03,700
Well, it's obvious. India again, China virus, anyone?

268
00:31:04,750 --> 00:31:08,350
Flu rate, political. It's coming from there.

269
00:31:08,980 --> 00:31:18,270
Malignant, really bad, pestilential, biblical, spasmodic, symptomatic.

270
00:31:19,330 --> 00:31:22,510
And it gives you a sense of like, oh, how do I name this disease?

271
00:31:23,230 --> 00:31:25,810
What's the proper medical term for it?

272
00:31:25,960 --> 00:31:33,970
And whenever you have this kind of I would suggest you whenever you have a disagreement in terminology, pay attention to that,

273
00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:43,540
because what people are doing is trying to figure out what's the best framing device to approach their understanding for what they're looking at.

274
00:31:43,780 --> 00:31:49,860
So even today, when you think about. Any disease you encounter.

275
00:31:49,890 --> 00:31:52,920
Think about like, what are the terms that people are using to describe it?

276
00:31:53,130 --> 00:31:58,230
What's behind that terminology? What is not said in that terminology?

277
00:31:58,680 --> 00:32:02,790
I think it's really easy and important that we all can. We look for the political content.

278
00:32:03,480 --> 00:32:08,670
If it's a political content, then there might be something really important about that,

279
00:32:08,970 --> 00:32:14,670
or there might be something really rhetorically loaded about that, and it could go in either direction.

280
00:32:15,660 --> 00:32:19,530
Indian is not irrelevant in the case, but it is loaded.

281
00:32:20,760 --> 00:32:30,840
And so you start to see. Just a give you a sense of medical concern and confusion over what the disease is.

282
00:32:32,550 --> 00:32:36,990
Now, the the dominant theory when John Snow came to study.

283
00:32:40,780 --> 00:32:47,759
Cholera. Was what we call anti contagiousness or miasma theory here.

284
00:32:47,760 --> 00:32:50,960
And I'm going to just sort of lay it out for you in this little map.

285
00:32:50,970 --> 00:33:01,290
And so this idea that there's miasma, miasma, being decaying or decomposing, organic matter of some kind, that's a disease causing agent.

286
00:33:01,740 --> 00:33:10,410
And then there might be some kind of atmospheric influence on wind elevation.

287
00:33:10,920 --> 00:33:19,020
Those are the two prominent ones they think about and that it somehow goes into the lungs and

288
00:33:19,020 --> 00:33:25,260
there's a humoral or quasi humoral disruption and that leads the body to a disease state.

289
00:33:26,130 --> 00:33:33,300
So that means by humoral I just mean using those four humors, that ancient method of deciding what health is right.

290
00:33:33,310 --> 00:33:42,120
And in the ancient world, humoral health meant a balance. You were perfectly balanced between hot and cold, phlegmatic, slow and fast.

291
00:33:43,140 --> 00:33:47,580
Earth, wind, fire, water. All of those elements would be in balance.

292
00:33:47,910 --> 00:33:53,490
That's what health is. An imbalance would be something that needed to be corrected.

293
00:33:55,470 --> 00:33:59,790
It's a very ancient notion. There's lots of treatments that we think about.

294
00:34:00,240 --> 00:34:01,890
You know, you've probably heard of bloodletting.

295
00:34:03,070 --> 00:34:08,530
And we don't do so much bloodletting these days, but bloodletting is an effective way to reduce the temperature of the body.

296
00:34:10,360 --> 00:34:14,590
I remember sitting with a great English historian of medicine, Roy Porter,

297
00:34:15,190 --> 00:34:23,200
and I watched him actually scar forms of use of bloodletting device to bleed himself right in front of me at the Welcome Institute.

298
00:34:24,550 --> 00:34:31,090
And then we took his temperature. And your temperature will go down when you will remove blood from the system.

299
00:34:31,420 --> 00:34:37,810
So bloodletting does have the effect that there know you have fever will leach you or bloodletting.

300
00:34:38,560 --> 00:34:44,200
There's this attempt there on the theory that we're going to achieve balance and by cheating, Vallance will bring back his health.

301
00:34:46,750 --> 00:34:56,080
Now under certain atmospheric conditions, that body may also communicate the disease through what they call the fluvial.

302
00:34:56,570 --> 00:35:00,670
Right. So my arms are coming up from the ground. A fluvial are coming off of patients.

303
00:35:01,240 --> 00:35:10,540
So your bad breath, your sweat, your aspirations, you're seeing these every particle that you can imagine.

304
00:35:11,860 --> 00:35:18,130
But generally they were skin and sweat, not diarrhea, I might point out.

305
00:35:18,850 --> 00:35:28,630
And then new, new cases would spread. So what was interesting about this theory was it seemed to account for the dual nature of cholera.

306
00:35:29,140 --> 00:35:33,700
Cholera seemed to spread across the globe in broad amounts.

307
00:35:34,030 --> 00:35:43,750
And it also used to spread. There were computers and this kind of idea seem to handle both of those ideas pretty well.

308
00:35:44,510 --> 00:35:54,760
And so how useful functioned there to say, oh, under certain and especially air conditions like summertime cholera could become epidemic.

309
00:35:55,010 --> 00:36:04,300
And that was the sort of leading theory of the day by and this was the one that held sway with the Board of Health and the Sanatorium in London.

310
00:36:05,140 --> 00:36:14,200
This version of the theory is by, if you're interested, Dr. Thomas Southwood Smith, who's a well-known Victorian sort of physiologist.

311
00:36:18,110 --> 00:36:21,380
There were other models of disease. There was one particular.

312
00:36:22,470 --> 00:36:26,200
For a disease that people knew very well that was spread in a different way.

313
00:36:26,200 --> 00:36:31,440
It was bring a contact and this would be the contagious disease, and that was smallpox.

314
00:36:31,980 --> 00:36:44,960
It was well known that smallpox could be contracted by direct contact with pustules or with placing emanations from it on a blanket,

315
00:36:44,970 --> 00:36:53,190
as we know, was notoriously done in the new world to attack sort of Native American populations.

316
00:36:53,550 --> 00:37:00,540
But also it was just clearly there was clearly evidence that there was one particular form

317
00:37:00,540 --> 00:37:06,480
of epidemic disease that people did understand change through contact and direct contact.

318
00:37:06,900 --> 00:37:11,390
But other other forms of it didn't work there.

319
00:37:11,400 --> 00:37:17,820
So, so anti contagion ism. This miasma theory had kind of set of uses to it.

320
00:37:18,930 --> 00:37:26,190
That disease causing matter in the atmosphere could be physical and environmental, inhaled through the lungs,

321
00:37:26,190 --> 00:37:31,770
into the blood, disrupt the physiology, and then spread in the general way and then spread in a local way.

322
00:37:33,720 --> 00:37:43,740
The contagiousness model had the virtue of there is a particular matter of virus or it's produced in the sick body.

323
00:37:43,740 --> 00:37:51,030
The infection happens, any of the touch or through fabric or some other kind of transmission that could then spread.

324
00:37:51,930 --> 00:37:57,659
So anomalous facts could be explained by a form of that.

325
00:37:57,660 --> 00:38:02,729
So they developed what they called a contingent contagion ism, and they basically said,

326
00:38:02,730 --> 00:38:09,090
Well, this cholera must be basically my asthmatic, otherwise we can't see how it's spread.

327
00:38:09,990 --> 00:38:19,430
It must basically be spread through the air. But then under certain particular circumstances it could become direct through direct contact.

328
00:38:19,440 --> 00:38:22,980
And that way they tried to accommodate these two ideas.

329
00:38:23,250 --> 00:38:27,780
And this was this was a complex multilevel sort of way of thinking about it.

330
00:38:27,990 --> 00:38:31,260
And it seemed to have a kind of sophisticated notion.

331
00:38:31,260 --> 00:38:36,960
So the disease may be contagious or not, depending on factors such as individual susceptibility,

332
00:38:37,290 --> 00:38:43,210
filth, poverty, diet habits, elevation, the amount of contagion and weather.

333
00:38:43,590 --> 00:38:49,410
And it seemed to be those are all the factors there. And that would explain why some people got it and some people didn't get it.

334
00:38:50,340 --> 00:38:58,500
And you can see in there a whole set of class biases can start to move into the assumptions on a whole set of social notions out there.

335
00:38:59,550 --> 00:39:05,720
So here's a way kind of just to think about on.

336
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:10,870
These these two for theories like what a be energies do they have.

337
00:39:10,880 --> 00:39:16,610
Well the anti contagion is so it's kind of instantaneous and this is the greatest number of victims in the fewest days.

338
00:39:17,330 --> 00:39:22,520
So how do you account for like the Broad Street outbreak that we'll talk about in ten days?

339
00:39:22,520 --> 00:39:27,620
About 616 individuals die on the peak a day of it.

340
00:39:28,160 --> 00:39:33,020
I think 127 die in one day. So, you know, how do you explain that?

341
00:39:33,590 --> 00:39:37,640
600 people in ten days, all from the same disease?

342
00:39:38,210 --> 00:39:41,910
Well, anticholinergic, you could they could have all touched each other.

343
00:39:42,460 --> 00:39:46,810
They couldn't all had direct contact with each other. We can prove that they didn't have direct contact with each other.

344
00:39:46,820 --> 00:39:53,570
So the concept of the vector is not available at this moment in time to the physicians.

345
00:39:53,570 --> 00:40:01,340
So they're thinking about how can we understand something happening so broadly?

346
00:40:02,360 --> 00:40:05,990
So Anticholinergics seems to be the most attractive theory for that.

347
00:40:07,100 --> 00:40:09,380
It's also not traceable to human contact.

348
00:40:09,530 --> 00:40:19,610
So all the unknowns and as Rumsfeld would call the known unknowns and unknown unknowns can be put into that box there of a possible way.

349
00:40:20,150 --> 00:40:28,490
Also, it seems that with cholera, the medical attendants are often spared, whereas with smallpox, the medical attendants are often not spared.

350
00:40:29,930 --> 00:40:38,739
And so. You know, just think about, you know, we knew pretty quickly that it would be spread through there.

351
00:40:38,740 --> 00:40:42,430
But do you remember how many of you were wiping doors down constantly?

352
00:40:42,700 --> 00:40:48,040
There was so much issue about how long could this live on a surface?

353
00:40:49,310 --> 00:40:55,120
You know, we had plenty of moments that are very useful to think about where we had our own theories about,

354
00:40:55,120 --> 00:41:00,849
well, is this disease mostly spread through the air or through inhaled closed spaces,

355
00:41:00,850 --> 00:41:04,839
or is it also spread through remote forms of transmission where some infected

356
00:41:04,840 --> 00:41:08,620
person touched a doorknob and then 7 minutes later you touch your doorknob,

357
00:41:08,620 --> 00:41:12,970
or if you're sitting on a toilet and someone had it, can it emanate up through the toilet?

358
00:41:13,240 --> 00:41:19,810
Many people telling me this this particular idea very much similar to the kinds of speculation going on here.

359
00:41:20,960 --> 00:41:28,840
And then then when the outbreak seemed to arise somewhere, suddenly Miasma theory seemed to hold their contagion.

360
00:41:28,840 --> 00:41:33,030
ISM has a couple advantages, too.

361
00:41:33,070 --> 00:41:36,550
One is it propagates gradually the number of cases build.

362
00:41:37,660 --> 00:41:43,660
And so, you know, you tell two friends and they tell two friends and they'll tell their friends and so on and so on.

363
00:41:43,660 --> 00:41:53,800
As an old adage used to say, This idea of word of mouth or touch the contagion ism patterns seem to have that exponential kind of quality to them,

364
00:41:54,940 --> 00:42:06,250
and they're traceable in those ways. And medical attendants often do contract the disease, so you start to get looking at the social patterns there.

365
00:42:06,820 --> 00:42:10,480
The contagious model seems to hold possibilities there.

366
00:42:11,410 --> 00:42:18,910
And and then there was the notion that immunity, which is not something that really happens with cholera,

367
00:42:19,630 --> 00:42:23,620
we don't tend to be immune to cholera after exposed to it.

368
00:42:24,430 --> 00:42:29,560
You can you're just as susceptible to it. But because of the smallpox model they knew about,

369
00:42:30,550 --> 00:42:35,440
they're beginning to understand immunity and they were looking at sort of questions of immunity there.

370
00:42:35,680 --> 00:42:38,430
So so these are ways to start to think about like, well,

371
00:42:38,440 --> 00:42:50,560
why would people be attracted to one over another given all the the uncertainty and that emerged in this kind of very quickly,

372
00:42:50,920 --> 00:42:56,170
a theory of of contingent contagion ism basically where.

373
00:42:59,120 --> 00:43:06,590
You have sort of two routes, basically. And I'll just say the decomposing matter is still the main cause of it, the miasma.

374
00:43:06,830 --> 00:43:10,280
The contingencies are environmental factors of filth and overcrowding.

375
00:43:10,580 --> 00:43:15,650
So in those situations, it can be spread directly to other persons when you don't have those.

376
00:43:15,920 --> 00:43:19,550
It just sort of spreads in this sort of general way.

377
00:43:20,390 --> 00:43:26,510
And so that seemed to account for the social conditions that are going on there.

378
00:43:26,510 --> 00:43:33,590
And that's basically the forms of theories that enter that John Snow enters into this this question.

379
00:43:34,730 --> 00:43:42,630
So. Let's see.

380
00:43:42,640 --> 00:43:50,850
Oh, I have one more. I thought this one came later. But William Farr, who's an extremely important physician in Britain, in this time,

381
00:43:50,850 --> 00:43:57,329
he's the the head of the the General Registrar's Office, the General Records Office.

382
00:43:57,330 --> 00:44:02,400
The office is keeping all the statistics on death and morbidity in England.

383
00:44:02,580 --> 00:44:06,540
England is a recordkeeping nation by 1831 and 32.

384
00:44:06,540 --> 00:44:12,209
And that's why this is so important that they're starting to be modern in the sense that they're looking at their whole health population.

385
00:44:12,210 --> 00:44:18,780
They have a board of health. They're considering these in their approaches to problems, are going to have a bureaucratic quality to them.

386
00:44:18,780 --> 00:44:25,019
So when there are epidemics and it's not just the Domesday Book that these records are going to go into,

387
00:44:25,020 --> 00:44:30,210
but they're starting to keep very meticulous records about morbidity and mortality.

388
00:44:30,450 --> 00:44:37,019
And William Farr is is the person who's in charge of that enterprise.

389
00:44:37,020 --> 00:44:40,559
And he has basically a contingent contagious belief.

390
00:44:40,560 --> 00:44:47,460
He's in charge of that office. He's the person you have to convince if you're going to get your theory widely accepted.

391
00:44:47,730 --> 00:44:55,740
And he basically has a contingent contagion sort of idea there where he thinks atmospheric conditions, including altitude,

392
00:44:56,220 --> 00:44:59,370
is going to be sort of an important thing because he's looking at where the deaths

393
00:44:59,370 --> 00:45:04,290
are happening and he notices a lot of the deaths are happening at lower altitudes.

394
00:45:07,190 --> 00:45:13,640
They don't have idea why that might be. One with more deaths from cholera happen at lower altitudes.

395
00:45:15,860 --> 00:45:24,120
Yeah. Is there more water? Yes, there is more water at lower altitudes and more people are going to be living.

396
00:45:24,680 --> 00:45:27,890
Right. The ports, it's coming in through the ports.

397
00:45:28,250 --> 00:45:33,800
Often sailors and the first ones to get it. So people are crowded in lower areas.

398
00:45:34,040 --> 00:45:41,440
And so, you know, people thought that you could get you know, if you think about other disease vectors that are associated with my asthma.

399
00:45:41,480 --> 00:45:45,890
So probably the two most famous are yellow fever and malaria.

400
00:45:47,950 --> 00:45:50,950
Malaria. Think about the name. Bad air.

401
00:45:52,420 --> 00:45:56,920
Malaria. Influenza. Influence of the stars.

402
00:45:57,730 --> 00:46:03,490
It's in the names of the diseases. Buenos Aires became a popular city because they said, no, no.

403
00:46:03,490 --> 00:46:07,420
The malaria is over there. Come to this city where the good air is.

404
00:46:08,230 --> 00:46:12,250
And of course, around cities, there were swamps. And around swamps there are mosquitoes.

405
00:46:12,580 --> 00:46:16,989
And of course, we know today that the mosquito borne vector is what's causing those diseases.

406
00:46:16,990 --> 00:46:20,560
But people thought, oh, you went into the swampy area with a miasma work,

407
00:46:21,370 --> 00:46:26,409
or maybe you live over here where the plague pit was and my asthma emanated from that.

408
00:46:26,410 --> 00:46:31,420
So lower levels seemed to indicate there was more of it there.

409
00:46:31,460 --> 00:46:38,140
But but for far, he's like, I'm going to be agnostic about water because I think it's still coming to the lungs.

410
00:46:40,350 --> 00:46:45,900
But altitude has something to do with this disease. And I don't know what it is, but I need to control for altitude.

411
00:46:46,090 --> 00:46:49,170
That's what made him a brilliant statistician. He starts to look at me.

412
00:46:49,260 --> 00:46:52,950
Well, what if we get all the data about altitude and the deaths and all the data?

413
00:46:52,950 --> 00:46:57,390
And he starts saying, okay, so that looks like a good contingent contagion model for me,

414
00:46:58,110 --> 00:47:01,500
because it turns out that the people who live around the ports. Guess where?

415
00:47:01,530 --> 00:47:04,530
Guess what their living conditions are? Well, they seem to be dirtier.

416
00:47:04,950 --> 00:47:10,980
They seem to have poor sanitation. They seem to have all these things that he can start to target their class background.

417
00:47:11,910 --> 00:47:18,450
And so, you know, he is a good medical practitioner thinking in a contingent containment model.

418
00:47:18,450 --> 00:47:21,750
He comes up with the most sophisticated one he can think of.

419
00:47:23,970 --> 00:47:31,470
In fact, I'll just give you I won't go into the detail. But here's Farr's graph of cholera incidence related to elevation.

420
00:47:33,780 --> 00:47:37,169
And basically, you can see the higher elevations.

421
00:47:37,170 --> 00:47:40,319
The fewer the deaths are in, they spread out down at the bottom.

422
00:47:40,320 --> 00:47:47,370
So so he he created this very interesting sort of charting how we're going to trace this disease to its elevations.

423
00:47:48,510 --> 00:47:54,300
And if you're thinking that it's it's traveling on the air. That's exactly sort of how it might look.

424
00:47:55,830 --> 00:48:00,530
So snow, snow is this working class guy.

425
00:48:00,540 --> 00:48:04,910
As I said, she's encountered cholera. In his youth.

426
00:48:05,810 --> 00:48:10,910
He is. He's got weakness and he's been concerned about his health early on in his life.

427
00:48:10,910 --> 00:48:20,030
He reads a book by Jeff Newton on vegetarianism, and he becomes a vegetarian at about 15, 19 years of age.

428
00:48:20,270 --> 00:48:27,770
His whole life, he stays a vegetarian. He also is interested in pure drinking water and distills his own water.

429
00:48:28,730 --> 00:48:34,010
From that point on in his life, he's got this kind of concern about his body.

430
00:48:34,670 --> 00:48:37,220
He suffers, I think, from a kidney ailment.

431
00:48:38,120 --> 00:48:48,230
And he's basically goes, but he knows that London you know, he knows London is where the science of medicine is burgeoning in the 1830s and forties.

432
00:48:48,450 --> 00:48:53,450
Like if you want to get a real training in the medical, what they call the collateral sciences,

433
00:48:53,720 --> 00:48:58,880
chemistry, biology in particular, you have to go to London.

434
00:48:59,060 --> 00:49:04,180
He doesn't have the money to go to London. So he walks there. From Yorkshire.

435
00:49:05,080 --> 00:49:11,110
It's going to take a couple hundred miles and he's in he goes to the Great Windmill Street,

436
00:49:11,350 --> 00:49:15,370
which was one of the most democratic institutions in England for medicine.

437
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:20,200
Anyone who was bright enough could basically go to Great Windmill Street, and if you had a little money,

438
00:49:20,200 --> 00:49:26,050
he apparently had a rich uncle in Bath who might have funded some of his education there.

439
00:49:26,200 --> 00:49:33,399
And what that education does in thrust him into the Westminster Medical Society and these other medical societies in London,

440
00:49:33,400 --> 00:49:43,240
where there's young doctors who are all interested in medicine on a scientific basis, to use biology and chemistry to create a new physiology.

441
00:49:43,900 --> 00:49:52,000
And that's sort of in the 1830s and forties where he starts and he's living in Soho,

442
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:56,980
not far from where the Broad Street outbreak would be a working class neighborhood.

443
00:49:58,180 --> 00:50:06,490
And then in 1846, News from America comes that ether is discovered as a powerful anesthetic in surgery.

444
00:50:07,750 --> 00:50:13,700
And it's demonstrated famously at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston under the ether dome.

445
00:50:13,720 --> 00:50:23,230
You can still go there and see that Victorian landmark and immediately he looks at all of the data about it and he'd been studying chemistry.

446
00:50:23,440 --> 00:50:32,590
He's particularly good at chemistry and he figures out that the problem with volatile gases ether was a well known chemical agent.

447
00:50:33,160 --> 00:50:35,110
In fact, if you look at the history of anesthesia,

448
00:50:35,590 --> 00:50:42,190
it was a dentist in the United States who discovered that this ordinary chemical on the shelf had anesthetic properties,

449
00:50:42,400 --> 00:50:46,570
and he tried to cover up its name because everybody knew about ether.

450
00:50:47,140 --> 00:50:52,930
So he called lead the john sleep inducing drug, and he tried to patent it.

451
00:50:53,140 --> 00:50:57,790
And then people say, well, and you can't patent a use this chemical agents there.

452
00:50:58,600 --> 00:51:00,880
And quickly it spreads all over the world.

453
00:51:01,060 --> 00:51:08,290
Snow gets his hands on ether and he realizes very quickly that the problems people are having with ether is that it's a volatile.

454
00:51:09,460 --> 00:51:13,840
And what he does is he builds a water bath, that metallic inhaler,

455
00:51:15,160 --> 00:51:21,760
and he controls the temperature at which the gas is being released from the volatile.

456
00:51:22,060 --> 00:51:24,820
And by controlling the gas, he controlled the dosage.

457
00:51:25,300 --> 00:51:35,810
He does animal experiments and human experiments and he basically figures out what we call the inverse blood ratio for solvents,

458
00:51:35,810 --> 00:51:44,530
salt soluble gases in the blood, and starts to chart those in terms of the physiological reactions of ether as an inhaled substance.

459
00:51:44,530 --> 00:51:48,820
And he becomes immediately the best practitioner of anesthesia.

460
00:51:49,000 --> 00:51:53,260
He writes several papers on what he calls narcotics, and that's his word for anesthesia.

461
00:51:53,500 --> 00:52:05,050
He even does experiments in alcohol. He's a teetotaler. And so he gets himself drunk deliberately in order to figure out the levels of intoxication.

462
00:52:06,100 --> 00:52:09,430
Guess what he comes up with as a level for human intoxication?

463
00:52:12,150 --> 00:52:20,210
So when we used today. He actually determines exactly what the blood levels of because alcoholism is a volatile as well.

464
00:52:20,660 --> 00:52:24,440
And so he realizes, like, how do we look at blood alcohol level? How do we measure them?

465
00:52:24,680 --> 00:52:27,830
How do we correlate those to the symptoms of alcohol poisoning?

466
00:52:28,820 --> 00:52:30,650
He does the same thing with with ether.

467
00:52:31,580 --> 00:52:38,930
He controls the dosage and he starts he realizes, you know, a lot of early anesthesia when the doctor was applying the anesthesia,

468
00:52:38,930 --> 00:52:43,370
often on a cloth, often uncontrolled, and then they're operating.

469
00:52:43,610 --> 00:52:48,080
And he says, no, you have to have a person regulating this process.

470
00:52:48,230 --> 00:52:56,570
And he becomes really the first professional anesthetist who's not only doing scientific research on anesthesia and how it works,

471
00:52:56,900 --> 00:53:00,830
he's also administering it. And everybody knows he's the safest.

472
00:53:00,830 --> 00:53:05,330
Now, ether is relatively safe in terms of killing patients, but it has two dangers.

473
00:53:05,690 --> 00:53:09,560
One is nausea. The other is it's flammable.

474
00:53:10,640 --> 00:53:17,000
So fire. So he very quickly finds it inconvenient.

475
00:53:18,050 --> 00:53:28,670
Next year, a Scottish physician discovers that chloroform is another agent and he he uses chloroform and finds he's even better with chloroform.

476
00:53:28,700 --> 00:53:35,150
Now, it turns out he will have his first death from chloroform in 1855 and he realizes it's dangerous.

477
00:53:35,960 --> 00:53:40,730
Chloroform was used in England up until the 1950s, until it was proven that it could stop the heart.

478
00:53:41,810 --> 00:53:44,870
But he started to make a search for what he called the perfect anesthetic.

479
00:53:45,290 --> 00:53:49,910
He's inhaling and moving. He's a, you know, all kinds of inhalants looking for something.

480
00:53:50,510 --> 00:53:59,419
He would, of course, probably most famously, he would give chloroform to Queen Victoria during childbirth in 1853.

481
00:53:59,420 --> 00:54:06,800
And that caused a revolution because the ministry in England, the Church of England, said no women must suffer in childbirth.

482
00:54:08,630 --> 00:54:17,480
This is against the Bible. And snow secretly is brought into the royal chambers where she delivers her seventh child.

483
00:54:17,750 --> 00:54:24,230
She called it that blessed chloroform and he didn't give it to her to actually put her under.

484
00:54:24,800 --> 00:54:28,700
He gave it to her in an analgesic form, whiffing it. So he created a cone.

485
00:54:28,950 --> 00:54:35,390
He was very sensitive about he didn't want to be the person putting an apparatus on the royal personage his face.

486
00:54:35,900 --> 00:54:44,180
So he she delicately sort of created this cone. Then he taught Prince Albert how to do it so he could administer, and she's basically whiffing it.

487
00:54:45,320 --> 00:54:49,880
And so that happens and it becomes a sensation.

488
00:54:49,890 --> 00:54:57,310
Women all over England, especially the upper classes, now want John Snow as their earnest, sleazy ologist.

489
00:54:57,320 --> 00:55:06,049
And when, you know, when they're thinking about the queen is requesting some pain relief, they know he's the best man in England for it.

490
00:55:06,050 --> 00:55:14,600
So they bring him in even though he's a working class person. And so his career has basically gone in that direction.

491
00:55:15,410 --> 00:55:23,780
And he's he's very successful. He moves out of Soho to Sackville Street, closer to Harley Street, a fancy park where Fancy Doctors in London live.

492
00:55:24,920 --> 00:55:26,240
And he's coming up in the world.

493
00:55:26,800 --> 00:55:37,970
1840 849 Cholera returns to England and Snow remembers what he'd seen and he decides he's going to make an investigation of it.

494
00:55:42,880 --> 00:55:46,060
And he does investigate it and I'll show you some of the investigations.

495
00:55:46,060 --> 00:55:53,620
But first, I just want to put his theory out there. This is what turns out to be the correct theory of cholera.

496
00:55:54,140 --> 00:56:00,070
Now, we've proven it that the transmission is is spread hand to mouth.

497
00:56:01,280 --> 00:56:06,140
What we call the oral fecal route. This is an unpleasant reality of humans.

498
00:56:06,920 --> 00:56:12,110
And as he noticed, you know, when he was thinking about the coal miners in Newcastle,

499
00:56:12,110 --> 00:56:16,850
he wrote very candidly in his journal, well, they were always swallowing their own excrement.

500
00:56:18,410 --> 00:56:24,830
And so he was aware of the people inadvertently are are doing this all the time in the

501
00:56:24,830 --> 00:56:32,180
problem of the history of hygiene is that you're starting to see ordinary hygienic practices.

502
00:56:32,300 --> 00:56:38,230
You know how many of you still wash your hands? Counting in 20 seconds. We got about five.

503
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:46,450
We got about five. Right. It's it's hard to sit there and go ABC, the G8, you know,

504
00:56:46,600 --> 00:56:52,090
if you actually want to follow the rules of hygiene, we live in an age of convenience, right?

505
00:56:52,150 --> 00:56:57,760
Everything about what we do is geared towards convenience, convenience, convenience, high speed.

506
00:56:57,880 --> 00:57:04,120
How can I do it faster? How can we do this closer? Quicker. So hygiene and those kinds of manners.

507
00:57:04,330 --> 00:57:07,389
This is the beginning of that era. This is the beginning of it.

508
00:57:07,390 --> 00:57:13,120
And he realizes that there's a problem with, you know, two modes of transmission.

509
00:57:13,540 --> 00:57:21,040
The other modern form is drinking water. Now, up to this point, most people got their water either from pumps or from wells.

510
00:57:21,820 --> 00:57:24,910
But you're starting to see what we call infrastructure coming.

511
00:57:24,910 --> 00:57:27,880
The Victorian infrastructure is arriving in London.

512
00:57:28,120 --> 00:57:36,000
The people are starting to get water and toilets pumped and piped into their houses and there are companies burgeoning willing to supply that water.

513
00:57:36,010 --> 00:57:42,129
So the invention of the water company and pipe systems, what we call infrastructure,

514
00:57:42,130 --> 00:57:47,410
is now part of the calculation that people are not taking into consideration.

515
00:57:47,710 --> 00:57:55,240
But Snow is looking at it, and he starts to see evidence that the causative agent,

516
00:57:55,240 --> 00:57:59,800
which he does not know, is whether an animal or a chemical, whether it's inert, alive or dead.

517
00:58:00,850 --> 00:58:07,479
He he it's coming into the mouth and being spread and enters the intestine and it multiplies somehow.

518
00:58:07,480 --> 00:58:16,420
There attaches to a mucous membrane, causes vocal irritation, and then produces the symptoms of cholera and then is evacuated.

519
00:58:17,410 --> 00:58:22,320
And in that evacuation, there are a number of ways, of course, which it can spread again through those two groups.

520
00:58:23,400 --> 00:58:28,920
And and this is basically the theory he comes up with. Now, how does he arrive at this theory?

521
00:58:30,900 --> 00:58:38,370
There are a couple of key cases for him. In 1848, 49, there is a.

522
00:58:40,470 --> 00:58:46,050
There's a house with a brick drain and a water storage tank.

523
00:58:47,270 --> 00:58:49,340
Near this is Battersea Field,

524
00:58:49,350 --> 00:59:00,200
so it's near to the Thames in London and there's a heavy rainstorm in July and a heavy rainstorm causes flooding and the river backs up.

525
00:59:00,770 --> 00:59:04,940
And when it backs up, it backs up into the cesspool.

526
00:59:04,940 --> 00:59:13,040
There's a brick drain there. See that drain? I don't have a laser pointer, but if you look at the top and you see where the line and the brick drain,

527
00:59:13,040 --> 00:59:20,810
there's a sewer there, a line that goes to the Thames. And when that floods, it backs up in to that cesspool.

528
00:59:21,560 --> 00:59:28,920
You know, the cesspool is. Not far from the water storage tank.

529
00:59:28,930 --> 00:59:35,710
And there's another problem, the water storage tank little lower than the cesspool.

530
00:59:36,010 --> 00:59:40,210
So when that overflows, it flows into the water storage.

531
00:59:41,440 --> 00:59:46,970
And there is this outbreak. This is a place called Albion Tariffs.

532
00:59:47,950 --> 00:59:59,140
And he starts to see that the cesspool drains were higher than the water storage area, and he suspects that the cholera came into that area.

533
00:59:59,190 --> 01:00:06,849
Everyone here is the number. 13 deaths, one house, and he thinks it's from the back.

534
01:00:06,850 --> 01:00:10,089
Backup in the flood and the overflow. So.

535
01:00:10,090 --> 01:00:14,980
So he. He starts to investigate that and.

536
01:00:19,550 --> 01:00:25,760
And he looks he looks at all of the houses from the point where that that drains sort of.

537
01:00:27,380 --> 01:00:30,760
And he sees the first house as at home.

538
01:00:32,040 --> 01:00:35,550
July 28. Number 13 there.

539
01:00:37,740 --> 01:00:42,180
And then you start to see it spread locally.

540
01:00:42,180 --> 01:00:47,500
So he has a way in looking at this very first case of say, look, how could this disease come in?

541
01:00:47,520 --> 01:00:51,390
Well, it's coming into the Thames because it's summer time and it's spreading there.

542
01:00:51,630 --> 01:00:56,910
Then we get this heavy rain. It floods in. And how can we make a kind of point source outbreak?

543
01:00:56,910 --> 01:01:01,890
And it kind of makes a connection there between those places.

544
01:01:02,580 --> 01:01:09,479
And the drinking water is found to be impure and there's a cesspool opening there which begins to sort of say,

545
01:01:09,480 --> 01:01:17,550
well, maybe this is a way we can begin to understand a different model of the transmission of the disease.

546
01:01:17,580 --> 01:01:22,950
Now, he'd been studying anesthesia, so but in his seizure, especially in this period, is inhalants.

547
01:01:23,370 --> 01:01:28,560
So he knows the effect of an inhalant on the lungs at short range.

548
01:01:29,250 --> 01:01:33,030
And he's very well acquainted with how gases enter the lungs.

549
01:01:33,360 --> 01:01:40,440
And he doesn't see any pathophysiology that indicates that this disease is being spread in the lungs,

550
01:01:40,500 --> 01:01:45,630
nor does he see any of the kinds of behaviors he correlates with inhaled poisons.

551
01:01:46,500 --> 01:01:55,950
So he begins to concentrate on the problem, the alimentary canal and the gut, and he starts to look for evidence that would correspond to that.

552
01:01:58,080 --> 01:02:04,170
And what he does is is and I think this is really remarkable because what he does here

553
01:02:04,500 --> 01:02:09,690
is tries to cultivate a theory that tries to explain not just how things spread,

554
01:02:09,960 --> 01:02:17,820
but looking at social behaviors and correlating those to how the disease is spreading as well.

555
01:02:18,150 --> 01:02:25,050
So there's a sort of a big list, but basically when he looks in Alby and Terrace,

556
01:02:26,700 --> 01:02:33,540
he sees and is the second one there, it's affected in the nearby houses seem to be exempt.

557
01:02:33,840 --> 01:02:40,530
And he says, well, the ones that where it overflowed and they were getting their water from it, they were the ones that were most affected.

558
01:02:40,800 --> 01:02:42,330
And the other ones are exempt.

559
01:02:42,870 --> 01:02:53,160
And and then he starts to look at all the provincial towns that are affected and all of the provincial towns that are are exempted from it.

560
01:02:53,730 --> 01:03:00,630
And in each case, he starts to see that there are ways to explain how water could have crossed it

561
01:03:01,140 --> 01:03:06,210
and how water could have exempted people from getting it at different moments.

562
01:03:07,020 --> 01:03:11,250
And so he's looking here, if you just look at this, the totality of it,

563
01:03:11,460 --> 01:03:15,420
he's trying to look at the whole country of England, looking at reports of where it is.

564
01:03:15,420 --> 01:03:20,550
And he says on Birmingham, the river's polluted by sewers, but the drinking water is obtained elsewhere.

565
01:03:21,630 --> 01:03:30,000
So he's like, well, how can people in Birmingham didn't get it? You know, Birmingham's big industrial city, he said, Well, they have a polluted river,

566
01:03:30,000 --> 01:03:33,480
but they're not getting the drinking water from the river there.

567
01:03:33,510 --> 01:03:37,559
So he's looking at not just where the water is, not just the levels,

568
01:03:37,560 --> 01:03:44,640
but what are the people actually doing to, you know, to actually get their water into their system there.

569
01:03:45,870 --> 01:03:50,640
So so the scale is part of what I want you to just take note of here.

570
01:03:54,110 --> 01:03:56,040
I'm going to skip over one here for a second.

571
01:03:59,220 --> 01:04:07,920
And you know, what I want you to think about here is sort of Jon Snow is what I call kind of a multi levels systems thinker.

572
01:04:08,310 --> 01:04:14,219
So he's he's thinking at scale and he's thinking at the scale of the smallest scale,

573
01:04:14,220 --> 01:04:21,360
the cellular, what is the physiology of the mucous membranes of the intestine?

574
01:04:22,380 --> 01:04:32,670
Then the next level is physiological. Like how does those cellular observations connect or be can be explained by physiological behavior.

575
01:04:32,880 --> 01:04:39,450
Then he's looking at the individual and the movements of the person where they get their water, where they were.

576
01:04:39,810 --> 01:04:44,130
And and we start to think about, you know, this organ systems,

577
01:04:44,580 --> 01:04:52,080
if you think about it from the bottom up here we go from organ systems and there there's a mixture of induction and deduction.

578
01:04:52,290 --> 01:04:59,640
Deduction can be made strictly about known physiological principles, but he has to induce certain other ideas here.

579
01:04:59,850 --> 01:05:03,390
He has to say, I think I can't prove,

580
01:05:03,660 --> 01:05:09,450
but I think that there's a correlation that has a strong causal connection there

581
01:05:09,450 --> 01:05:14,640
between what you're seeing in the symptoms and the gut and the way it's infecting.

582
01:05:14,670 --> 01:05:21,090
How do you rule out the lungs? That's an inductive sort of move on his part.

583
01:05:21,630 --> 01:05:29,730
At the level the person. Then he looks at you know, the level the household vital statistics describing their sociology,

584
01:05:29,730 --> 01:05:37,110
who's the food preparer, whose hands were soiled, whose drinking water was contaminated?

585
01:05:37,290 --> 01:05:46,829
How could that happen? When we get to the Broad Street case, the index case is a baby that gets cholera and the mother takes the nappies,

586
01:05:46,830 --> 01:05:50,550
the diapers and washes them out in the sewer.

587
01:05:51,000 --> 01:05:57,570
And that sewer has a crack in it. And that sewer is above the level of the system for the Broad Street Pump.

588
01:05:58,230 --> 01:06:02,280
So that gets in. And that's where we think the index case comes from.

589
01:06:02,280 --> 01:06:09,359
But it's a behavior, right? It's the mother wanting to get rid of the dirty diapers, thinking at the level of the household.

590
01:06:09,360 --> 01:06:13,860
And then he looks at the neighborhood, Broad Street when he come to look at that one here in a minute,

591
01:06:14,700 --> 01:06:19,980
you have the same kind of pattern seeking there where people getting their water from.

592
01:06:21,690 --> 01:06:29,640
What are they drinking in Broad Street? There are many cases clustered around the water supply of that pump,

593
01:06:30,000 --> 01:06:36,210
but there's a brewery across the street from it and the brewery, all the Brewers drink beer.

594
01:06:37,470 --> 01:06:44,690
Beer is, you know, not susceptible to cholera because it's heated and it kills off the germs.

595
01:06:44,690 --> 01:06:50,639
So none of the brewers die. So he's aware like that.

596
01:06:50,640 --> 01:06:56,600
It's not just simply proximity, but you always have to trace what's the behavior going on here?

597
01:06:56,600 --> 01:06:58,140
And he's looking for it at that level.

598
01:06:58,260 --> 01:07:06,120
And then you go to the large city and town is getting vital statistics and he's looking at where where there's sewage, where the water supplies are.

599
01:07:06,330 --> 01:07:13,620
And then he looks at nations and continents. And as I said, you know, many people thought that California was some kind of edenic paradise.

600
01:07:13,620 --> 01:07:16,140
It's like, no, the cholera just seems to follow it.

601
01:07:16,410 --> 01:07:22,670
And he noticed something about the way cholera spread around the world, which indicated that it couldn't be in my asthma or wind.

602
01:07:22,830 --> 01:07:26,280
And he says it never travels faster than human population.

603
01:07:27,640 --> 01:07:32,110
That's the inside, he says. Like, wherever you watch it, humans have to go first.

604
01:07:32,260 --> 01:07:37,750
And so he knows that this is traveling with the humans, not traveling by the wind,

605
01:07:37,840 --> 01:07:42,550
because if the wind could carry it, then certainly the wind could carry it ahead of the humans.

606
01:07:43,240 --> 01:07:47,710
But it's traveling at the speed of human transport.

607
01:07:48,250 --> 01:07:52,120
So you have the notion of trade coming up there.

608
01:08:00,590 --> 01:08:09,319
So he was kind of a list of kind of inductions that he makes at the level of pathology, the minimal autopsy findings overall,

609
01:08:09,320 --> 01:08:13,970
sometimes bowels filled with fluid, even when there had been no collar evacuations during life.

610
01:08:14,780 --> 01:08:20,450
He induces that there's some kind of pathology going on, even in places where you can't find the tell tale evacuations.

611
01:08:21,440 --> 01:08:28,850
The deduction is that the causative agent or particle must be a local irritant to gut membrane, causing massive fluid loss.

612
01:08:30,140 --> 01:08:31,670
That's what he induces there.

613
01:08:32,330 --> 01:08:41,330
He looks at microscopic evidence and he deduces that the causative agent is not yet seen but has some functional attributes that it must be swallowed,

614
01:08:41,330 --> 01:08:44,840
excreted, capable of multiplication.

615
01:08:46,130 --> 01:08:49,460
And he calls it. He doesn't have the idea of a germ.

616
01:08:49,610 --> 01:08:58,030
Right. The germ is not available to him. So he calls it a special animal poison and special animal poison.

617
01:08:58,040 --> 01:09:06,050
I think you need to emphasize the word special that it infects particular species in a very limited and discreet way.

618
01:09:06,890 --> 01:09:13,640
It's animal in who it affects, and it may be animal in nature, but he doesn't know what it is he calls it.

619
01:09:13,880 --> 01:09:18,140
And it may be attributable to a kind of small animal.

620
01:09:18,500 --> 01:09:24,620
It may also be attributed what he calls putrefaction. The normal process of what he calls continuous molecular change.

621
01:09:25,260 --> 01:09:27,860
That's what he says in his first investigations of it.

622
01:09:28,970 --> 01:09:37,820
And then he looks sort of through that molecules and he makes an assumption there that continuous molecular change is sort of there.

623
01:09:37,820 --> 01:09:41,930
And then he induces that when the blood lacks these elements of water and salt,

624
01:09:42,320 --> 01:09:48,800
they're found in increasing quantities in in the excretions, what people put out.

625
01:09:49,010 --> 01:09:53,000
So if one were to measure and that's hard to do, of course, in a cholera situation.

626
01:09:53,260 --> 01:10:00,290
But he hypothesizes, like, okay, if they're leaving the body, we should be able to measure how much is lost from those bodies.

627
01:10:00,290 --> 01:10:06,320
And if you were to be able to measure a cholera victim's excretions, you should see the loss of the soul there.

628
01:10:06,560 --> 01:10:13,010
So he's really thinking about it in a in a way where he has a set of what we call

629
01:10:13,010 --> 01:10:18,500
inductions and deductions in his thinking as he's trying to prove his case.

630
01:10:19,430 --> 01:10:29,360
Now, what happens is he's not successful in persuading the medical authorities in 1840 849 that it's being transmitted by water.

631
01:10:30,920 --> 01:10:33,440
But he realizes that London is modernizing.

632
01:10:35,450 --> 01:10:43,280
It's modernizing in a particular way where water supply companies are now becoming more and more prevalent.

633
01:10:43,370 --> 01:10:55,850
And he realizes that two companies, in particular southern Vauxhall and Lambeth, had existed in the 1840 849 outbreak.

634
01:10:56,330 --> 01:11:04,370
And he but then he notices between that after 1840 849, Lambeth moves its intake valve upriver.

635
01:11:05,330 --> 01:11:10,040
So the River Thames is very polluted downriver when southern Vauxhall gets its water from.

636
01:11:10,310 --> 01:11:13,550
Now they're taking it for a purer source, higher up.

637
01:11:13,760 --> 01:11:17,120
So he figures that the next cholera outbreak that happens.

638
01:11:18,150 --> 01:11:28,260
He can do a study of these two water supply companies and [INAUDIBLE] be able to to compare the relative mortality and morbidity against that data.

639
01:11:29,310 --> 01:11:34,530
And he sees that there's an opportunity here for a natural experiment to try and prove his case.

640
01:11:34,830 --> 01:11:41,940
And sure enough, when the 1850 354 outbreak occurs, that's exactly when he starts to in fact,

641
01:11:41,940 --> 01:11:47,610
he goes to William Farr and says, would you put in your mortality rules?

642
01:11:48,150 --> 01:11:52,800
Another line about which water supply they got there, the water from.

643
01:11:53,660 --> 01:11:57,080
But for some reason, there's a complicated story that doesn't happen.

644
01:11:57,740 --> 01:12:07,190
So Snow has to end up going back himself, taking those death rolls and going door to door and using kind of shoe leather.

645
01:12:07,370 --> 01:12:12,380
So where do you get your water supply from? Is it Lambeth in southern or southern boxing?

646
01:12:13,430 --> 01:12:25,190
And he he's doing this study in in the summer of 1854, trying to single camera to really try and prove my case about how water is transmitted here.

647
01:12:26,250 --> 01:12:32,090
You know, this is a little bit small, but you can basically, if you look at the top there,

648
01:12:32,360 --> 01:12:38,479
he's got 31 subdistricts and he looks at the actual number of deaths and then the predicted number

649
01:12:38,480 --> 01:12:44,010
of deaths through a mathematical model about average mortality rates that would have happened.

650
01:12:44,030 --> 01:12:51,710
So he's looking at a very large in and if you're getting into epidemiology heavily he's he's starting to tend to try and

651
01:12:52,310 --> 01:13:00,230
compare the specific deaths in the relative water supplies against what would be the predicted average mortality there.

652
01:13:00,250 --> 01:13:08,240
It's a very sophisticated kind of statistical approach to looking at a way to prove that

653
01:13:08,450 --> 01:13:14,390
there is a factor here that could be now seen at a macroscopic level statistically.

654
01:13:14,900 --> 01:13:17,930
And he finds basically a 1 to 10 difference.

655
01:13:18,200 --> 01:13:26,660
So that in Knoxville has ten times the number of deaths than Lambeth has in every case that's known from cholera.

656
01:13:26,870 --> 01:13:30,260
And that's what he's doing when when he's.

657
01:13:33,320 --> 01:13:39,290
When he's called to the outbreak in Broad Street in July of 1854, August of 1854.

658
01:13:39,290 --> 01:13:45,560
He's basically called away from his study of the two water supplies.

659
01:13:46,400 --> 01:13:50,240
And basically what happened is.

660
01:13:54,010 --> 01:14:03,379
He he uses another feature here where he's trying to persuade people of the correctness of his theory and he's not been successful.

661
01:14:03,380 --> 01:14:11,660
So it's like, well, maybe if I create a visual version of that theory that is to take the data and put it in in a

662
01:14:11,660 --> 01:14:18,770
geographical visual array that would be more persuasive to those who are skeptical of my theory.

663
01:14:20,120 --> 01:14:24,350
He he's called away from his larger study of the water supplies.

664
01:14:24,620 --> 01:14:32,570
And he comes to Broad Street, his old neighborhood, and they're started about August 31st of 54.

665
01:14:33,440 --> 01:14:36,830
People are starting to die, peaks on the second.

666
01:14:37,250 --> 01:14:40,400
And then he maps it out.

667
01:14:40,970 --> 01:14:47,870
He gets the data from another, a minister who is also an epidemiologist.

668
01:14:48,380 --> 01:14:53,150
They basically suspect that it's the the pump is the culprit there.

669
01:14:53,780 --> 01:14:58,860
And he starts to map the data out. And he does something really interesting.

670
01:14:59,040 --> 01:15:05,550
Everybody sort of notices the danger here. What he actually does is most interesting is he compares it.

671
01:15:05,760 --> 01:15:10,350
Yeah, we're we're having a problem. And so he compares it here.

672
01:15:12,240 --> 01:15:20,850
Can you see this? Ooh, it's up there. He gets anything. Okay, here's a close up of his his finished map.

673
01:15:20,850 --> 01:15:26,220
Here. Now what? I try. What you see are the black lines are the number of deaths per household.

674
01:15:27,270 --> 01:15:32,159
But the most interesting line is this little dotted line you see at the bottom right hand corner there.

675
01:15:32,160 --> 01:15:35,760
And it's what you call a Voronezh diagram. I don't know if you've done any Verona.

676
01:15:36,870 --> 01:15:46,110
So Verona diagram is this is an epidemiological technique to look at a choice that people would make within a geographical area.

677
01:15:46,290 --> 01:15:55,049
So what Snow did was he mapped the water pumps in the area, not just the Broad Street one, but all the other pumps in the area.

678
01:15:55,050 --> 01:15:59,820
And he made an assumption that if you lived closer to one pump or another,

679
01:15:59,820 --> 01:16:04,890
you would go to the closest pump unless you had a particular reason for not going to the closest pump.

680
01:16:05,310 --> 01:16:15,090
And so he puts a line about where people who live might go to another pump in the area there.

681
01:16:15,630 --> 01:16:20,700
And that line marks the place where there's a behavior choice.

682
01:16:21,120 --> 01:16:25,740
And that behavior choice is based on convenience and proximity and the fact that water's heavy.

683
01:16:26,820 --> 01:16:32,610
And if you're going to bring back water to your household, you're probably going to go to the closest pump unless you have some compelling reason.

684
01:16:32,880 --> 01:16:36,000
Otherwise, there is one case where a woman who moved up to Hampstead,

685
01:16:36,900 --> 01:16:41,030
she was the widow of a man who owned a blasting cap factory, had lived in Boston.

686
01:16:41,040 --> 01:16:49,290
She was always partial to the water in Broad Street. So she had her her sons or associates bring her water up to Hampstead.

687
01:16:49,350 --> 01:16:53,610
She dies from the Broad Street outbreak way up in Hampstead, which is high.

688
01:16:54,480 --> 01:16:59,910
So there goes your far elevation theory. But she loved the taste of the water.

689
01:16:59,910 --> 01:17:03,240
People thought the water because she tasted better than other pumps.

690
01:17:03,930 --> 01:17:07,050
But basically what he's doing here is not just mapping.

691
01:17:07,590 --> 01:17:11,820
A lot of people look at this and they say, oh, John Snow says at the pump.

692
01:17:12,780 --> 01:17:16,590
He puts a line around it saying, obviously this is the culprit.

693
01:17:17,280 --> 01:17:25,410
What he's doing there is actually saying, what are the human behaviors around water gathering and water bearing in Victorian England at this time?

694
01:17:25,620 --> 01:17:29,580
And how do we map that behavior in relationship to this outbreak?

695
01:17:29,940 --> 01:17:34,259
And he creates a visual explanation of someone would have a choice.

696
01:17:34,260 --> 01:17:38,130
Which one did they go to? Where do the deaths concentrate or not?

697
01:17:39,150 --> 01:17:47,710
Okay. Let me conclude with.

698
01:17:49,000 --> 01:17:52,950
By 1866, John Snow.

699
01:17:55,140 --> 01:17:59,820
Theory is accepted in the in 1854, 53, 33, 54.

700
01:18:00,480 --> 01:18:07,470
The medical authorities are still skeptical. His map doesn't actually persuade his his critics because they look at the same data.

701
01:18:07,710 --> 01:18:12,150
They say, oh, it's clearly in my asthma outbreak. You can see how it sort of emanates from it.

702
01:18:13,740 --> 01:18:22,350
But by 1866, they've started to to the microscopy is improved and they start to go back and they

703
01:18:22,350 --> 01:18:27,179
look at Snow's research and they understand that it that it's actually correct.

704
01:18:27,180 --> 01:18:31,320
And when the outbreak hits in 66, they remove handles from infected pumps.

705
01:18:32,220 --> 01:18:37,140
And a great tribute is paid in The Lancet, which had been very critical and cruel about John Snow.

706
01:18:37,140 --> 01:18:41,130
And they say the researchers of Dr. Snow are among the most fruitful in modern medicine.

707
01:18:41,490 --> 01:18:49,470
He traced the history of cholera. We owed him chiefly the severe induction by which the influence of the poisoning of the water supplies was proved.

708
01:18:49,830 --> 01:18:54,450
No greater service can be rendered timidity that this is enabled us to meet and combat the

709
01:18:54,450 --> 01:19:00,000
disease where alone it is to be vanquished in its sources or channels of propagation.

710
01:19:00,210 --> 01:19:08,640
And I love that Victorian phrase severe induction. They know they didn't prove it in a deductive, absolutely certain way,

711
01:19:08,790 --> 01:19:17,280
but he used a set of probabilistic and multilevel forms of reasoning to point to that source.

712
01:19:17,310 --> 01:19:22,380
And I think the correctness, as great as the heroic correctness of it is,

713
01:19:23,940 --> 01:19:29,159
we also need to appreciate the method, even if you've been slightly wrong about it,

714
01:19:29,160 --> 01:19:35,129
because the method is is, is, is one of the soundest one where we face a crises,

715
01:19:35,130 --> 01:19:42,210
not thinking that it's the end of the world, but we come to it with our own resources and cogency.

716
01:19:43,290 --> 01:19:51,210
And so if we just think about some myths about John Snow, we can just we can conclude by just dismissing them.

717
01:19:51,630 --> 01:19:56,310
He didn't remove the handle from the point and stream. We like to think of heroes acting alone.

718
01:19:56,520 --> 01:19:58,400
But he was acting with groups of people. He's.
