2
00:00:06,168 --> 00:00:09,492
Now that I've given you introduction
to the topic of obesity,

3
00:00:09,492 --> 00:00:13,579
I like to delve a little further and
talk about the health impacts of obesity.

4
00:00:13,579 --> 00:00:15,634
Why do we care about obesity?

5
00:00:15,634 --> 00:00:19,660
It's often said that there's not a single
body system that isn't affected by

6
00:00:19,660 --> 00:00:20,211
obesity.

7
00:00:20,211 --> 00:00:23,998
We can think about our renal system,
our pulmonary system or

8
00:00:23,998 --> 00:00:25,715
our neurological system.

9
00:00:25,715 --> 00:00:29,837
Two of the major systems that are
significantly impacted by obesity are our

10
00:00:29,837 --> 00:00:33,480
cardiovascular system and
our endocrine system.

11
00:00:33,480 --> 00:00:37,230
Obesity is heavily correlated and
a strong risk factor for

12
00:00:37,230 --> 00:00:41,590
negative cardiovascular outcomes,
such as hypertension and stroke.

13
00:00:41,590 --> 00:00:45,882
It was recently identified that at
our current state of adolescent,

14
00:00:45,882 --> 00:00:49,730
obesity will contribute over
100,000 excess cases of

15
00:00:49,730 --> 00:00:52,915
cardiovascular disease
over the next 30 years.

16
00:00:52,915 --> 00:00:55,105
Looking to our endocrine system,

17
00:00:55,105 --> 00:00:59,345
currently 25% of young adults
are considered pre-diabetic.

18
00:00:59,345 --> 00:01:01,991
That is they're on
the pathway to diabetes.

19
00:01:01,991 --> 00:01:06,936
And if they don't lose weight or start to
exercise more, they will become diabetic.

20
00:01:06,936 --> 00:01:10,503
This epidemic of diabetes among
our young adults is almost

21
00:01:10,503 --> 00:01:15,398
completely attributable to our rising
rates of obesity among young children.

22
00:01:15,398 --> 00:01:19,299
Children who are obese tend to
stay obese over their lifetime and

23
00:01:19,299 --> 00:01:24,142
these obese children are experiencing
the health consequences of obesity such

24
00:01:24,142 --> 00:01:26,830
as diabetes at younger, and younger ages.

25
00:01:26,830 --> 00:01:31,196
So I also wanna discuss briefly the psycho
social implications of obesity.

26
00:01:31,196 --> 00:01:36,421
We know that individuals with obesity are
more likely to report poor self-esteem,

27
00:01:36,421 --> 00:01:39,378
depression and
experience eating disorders.

28
00:01:39,378 --> 00:01:44,223
However, it's really important to
consider that a big component of

29
00:01:44,223 --> 00:01:49,318
the mental health outcomes of obesity
are because in our society today,

30
00:01:49,318 --> 00:01:53,014
we are so bias and
we stigmatize obesity so greatly.

31
00:01:53,014 --> 00:01:56,921
So individuals with obesity
tend to enter a cycle.

32
00:01:56,921 --> 00:02:01,822
Individuals with obesity experience
stigma, they experience negative opinions

33
00:02:01,822 --> 00:02:06,874
about them which causes them to have body
dissatisfaction and depressive symptoms.

34
00:02:06,874 --> 00:02:10,717
What we know happens is those
individuals then try to lose weight.

35
00:02:10,717 --> 00:02:14,198
It's a natural reaction to people
being negative about your body,

36
00:02:14,198 --> 00:02:18,304
because we don't have very many effective
methods to help people lose weight.

37
00:02:18,304 --> 00:02:23,120
Individuals who are dieting, then tend to
rely on extreme weight control methods.

38
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:25,912
For example, choosing not to eat all day.

39
00:02:25,912 --> 00:02:30,030
Those extreme methods inevitably fail and
people start to overeat,

40
00:02:30,030 --> 00:02:34,442
and binge eat which leads to weight
gain again, and the cycle continues.

41
00:02:34,442 --> 00:02:37,493
So our obesity stigma
in US culture today or

42
00:02:37,493 --> 00:02:41,200
negativity about
individuals who are obese.

43
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:46,477
Feeds into this cycle and actually may be
contributing to excess weight gain among

44
00:02:46,477 --> 00:02:51,525
obese individuals which is counter to
what we wanna accomplish which is to help

45
00:02:51,525 --> 00:02:57,055
individuals with obesity obtain a healthy
weight, and feel good about themselves.

46
00:02:57,055 --> 00:03:01,930
Finally, because obesity is associated
with so many negative physical and

47
00:03:01,930 --> 00:03:03,615
mental health outcomes.

48
00:03:03,615 --> 00:03:06,837
Obesity is a significant burden
on our healthcare system.

49
00:03:06,837 --> 00:03:11,501
Individuals with obesity are estimated
to cost the healthcare system

50
00:03:11,501 --> 00:03:15,700
91% more costs per year than
individuals of normal weight.

51
00:03:15,700 --> 00:03:18,435
This is why we all need
to care about obesity and

52
00:03:18,435 --> 00:03:22,434
all need to be invested in trying
to help individuals with obesity,

53
00:03:22,434 --> 00:03:27,207
and our children with obesity
obtain a healthy, and active life.
