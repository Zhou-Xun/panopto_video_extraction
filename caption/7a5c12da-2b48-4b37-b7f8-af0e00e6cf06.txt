1
00:00:03,280 --> 00:00:07,020
Okay. Welcome back, everyone. How's everyone doing this morning?

2
00:00:07,830 --> 00:00:17,760
Good. Great. Just for today, I had a scheduling conflict, so I need to book my office hours to 3 to 4 this afternoon.

3
00:00:18,570 --> 00:00:23,550
Hopefully that doesn't cost too much of a convenience for anyone, but it'll just be for today.

4
00:00:23,970 --> 00:00:27,870
So. So instead of 4 to 5, it'll be 3 to 4.

5
00:00:28,470 --> 00:00:33,870
If that. If you're planning to come today, if you want to meet, like outside of the regular office windows,

6
00:00:33,870 --> 00:00:36,630
you can always email me and we can set up another chance to meet.

7
00:00:37,290 --> 00:00:46,530
So just FYI, I know that the problem set will be due on September 24th is a Saturday.

8
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:50,580
I would encourage you to try to get it submitted a little bit before then.

9
00:00:50,610 --> 00:00:54,660
I moved it up to the due date, I believe, to give you a little bit of extra time.

10
00:00:55,350 --> 00:01:01,319
I would encourage you to try to get that in a little bit early, maybe like that Friday or Thursday before the actual due date,

11
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:05,610
just in case there's any issues with uploading the files for that.

12
00:01:06,750 --> 00:01:14,579
Someone who came to office hours, I guess this is Friday, brought up a good point that I think I forgot to mention in class.

13
00:01:14,580 --> 00:01:26,790
So when you're doing like your reference doses and applying, say, uncertainty factors to the benchmark dose that you identified in the problem,

14
00:01:27,990 --> 00:01:34,830
you can assume, unless I specifically state in the problem that there is a modifying factor, you don't need to use that.

15
00:01:34,840 --> 00:01:37,900
So the only thing you'll use would be the uncertainty factors.

16
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:43,110
So that's where we're divided by ten to go from species to species extrapolation

17
00:01:43,380 --> 00:01:48,600
and then divided by ten again in order to account for human variability.

18
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:56,520
So that's what you're used to. Modifying factor is a special case in which we know that there's some kind of difference between, say,

19
00:01:56,520 --> 00:02:02,640
mice and people, wherein there is a biological pathway that's like more active in people compared to mice.

20
00:02:02,940 --> 00:02:06,179
And so we will use that modifying factor to account for that,

21
00:02:06,180 --> 00:02:12,209
that humans may be much more sensitive to this particular biological or toxicological endpoint than the mice.

22
00:02:12,210 --> 00:02:16,800
Well, so let's I specifically state that that just assume there's no modifying factor.

23
00:02:17,250 --> 00:02:19,890
Another way to say that is the modifying factor would be a one.

24
00:02:19,980 --> 00:02:25,740
So you just essentially don't need to adjust your reference dose at all, if that makes sense.

25
00:02:26,940 --> 00:02:32,220
I think that's all I had. So I'm just going to jump into the material for today.

26
00:02:32,910 --> 00:02:35,760
And then I think I think I might get done a little bit early today.

27
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:40,590
So we should have plenty of time for questions at the end if you want to talk about anything.

28
00:02:43,470 --> 00:02:47,010
Oh, yes. This is published on campus.

29
00:02:47,530 --> 00:02:51,929
No, I'm sorry. I didn't get the slides up before class today.

30
00:02:51,930 --> 00:02:57,450
I was just saying that. Yeah, sorry about that. I had a kind of a crazy weekend so those would come up.

31
00:02:57,450 --> 00:03:00,720
The students have done with or pretty soon after class today.

32
00:03:00,870 --> 00:03:07,110
I think I'll help with that. Yeah, sorry about that. Okay.

33
00:03:09,030 --> 00:03:12,450
Where were we so last time? There were a few slides.

34
00:03:12,450 --> 00:03:19,020
Right at the end we were talking about ADMA, which again stands for absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion.

35
00:03:19,530 --> 00:03:27,060
And so that was the we talked about essentially the first half of that material and we're going to return to that later in the course.

36
00:03:27,450 --> 00:03:35,190
But there were a few slides in that part, one material that I wanted to just make sure we went over before diving into Texaco Kinetics.

37
00:03:37,510 --> 00:03:41,080
So and this will be relevant for what we talk about today.

38
00:03:41,110 --> 00:03:46,730
So for distribution, what's the toxicant is in the bloodstream regardless of exposure out.

39
00:03:46,740 --> 00:03:56,889
Remember we talked about the different exposure routes. Inhalation, intravenous injection and absorption via the GI tract,

40
00:03:56,890 --> 00:04:02,110
such as like eating food that is contaminated with a toxicant regardless of the exposure route.

41
00:04:02,110 --> 00:04:06,570
When it eventually reaches the bloodstream, it can then be distributed throughout the body.

42
00:04:06,580 --> 00:04:09,670
So that's kind of an important concept to be aware of.

43
00:04:10,390 --> 00:04:16,600
And this rate of distribution is going to be related to the blood flow and the rate of the diffusion out of the capillaries

44
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:25,000
that are part of the vascular system and the affinity of this particular casino biotic or toxicant for specific tissues.

45
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:32,890
So this rate of distribution like for instance, a good example probably are PCBs, polychlorinated by phenols.

46
00:04:33,220 --> 00:04:40,180
They really like fats. And so they're going to diffuse quicker into fats that some than a chemical that's like less lipophilic.

47
00:04:41,350 --> 00:04:47,680
So yeah, we talked about all of that lipid felicity, not polarity, etc. in the last lecture.

48
00:04:50,660 --> 00:04:56,250
So yeah. And so toxicants can be concentrated in certain tissues that they have a higher affinity for.

49
00:04:56,270 --> 00:05:01,490
We could call these like storage sites sometimes. So for instance, lead can be stored in the bones for like decades.

50
00:05:02,870 --> 00:05:08,360
And this may or may not be the site of toxic action again with lead.

51
00:05:08,870 --> 00:05:13,339
Typically there are multiple toxicological mechanisms associated with lead exposure,

52
00:05:13,340 --> 00:05:22,370
but typically the main one worry that we're worried about in the case of lead exposure is neurodevelopmental effects on children that are exposed.

53
00:05:22,520 --> 00:05:25,430
There's obviously other things we could talk about, but that's one of the main ones,

54
00:05:25,760 --> 00:05:30,440
and that really doesn't have a ton to do with the storage site in the bones per se.

55
00:05:30,470 --> 00:05:34,850
It's just so that's just to show you that there could be a different site of the actual toxic

56
00:05:34,850 --> 00:05:41,090
action that we're most concerned about and see the area of the body where the chemical is stored.

57
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:50,050
And so toxic can tend to be in equilibrium with the free fat fraction that is circulating in the body.

58
00:05:50,070 --> 00:05:56,280
So another way to say that is if you excrete some of the toxicant out of the bloodstream or out into the urine,

59
00:05:56,580 --> 00:06:02,550
more will be freed up from the storage site and enter into the bloodstream or enter into the urine.

60
00:06:02,850 --> 00:06:05,890
So. See.

61
00:06:06,940 --> 00:06:14,019
Okay. So those are just the last two points I want to touch on. As far as ADD me, so ADD Me can lead us into taxable kinetics.

62
00:06:14,020 --> 00:06:18,430
So this is the study of how chemicals move through the body using like mathematical models.

63
00:06:20,750 --> 00:06:25,940
Yeah. The study of the modeling and mathematical description of the time course of disposition of a toxicant.

64
00:06:26,570 --> 00:06:31,010
So typically what we're talking about here is will be primarily focused on time where the

65
00:06:31,010 --> 00:06:35,870
toxin gets going over time and the change in the concentration of the toxicant in the body.

66
00:06:35,870 --> 00:06:41,540
We typically would spot that in this manner with time on the x axis and the concentration on the Y.

67
00:06:43,820 --> 00:06:51,250
Oftentimes you'll see a curve that looks like this. This is a really good example of like when we are exposed via the GI tract.

68
00:06:51,260 --> 00:06:54,650
So you'll take essentially for example,

69
00:06:54,830 --> 00:07:03,290
it can produce that's been contaminated with a pesticide and over time that is going to be absorbed from the GI tract and end up in,

70
00:07:03,770 --> 00:07:08,570
in the body, in the bloodstream. It's going to be absorbed over time and eventually you're going to hit a peak.

71
00:07:08,930 --> 00:07:15,590
And that's going to be followed by a drop off in the concentration of the chemical as the chemical is metabolized and excreted.

72
00:07:16,130 --> 00:07:19,910
And so the this timeframe could look different for different chemicals.

73
00:07:19,910 --> 00:07:24,860
You know, you could be talking about within a few hours. You could be talking about within a few days, but.

74
00:07:26,130 --> 00:07:31,170
That's kind of the basic curve you'll be you'll be looking at for a lot of these examples.

75
00:07:32,250 --> 00:07:36,660
And so this phase represents a phase where we have more toxin coming into the body and coming out.

76
00:07:37,980 --> 00:07:42,450
And then after that peak, we have more toxicant being excreted or going out than coming in.

77
00:07:45,030 --> 00:07:49,870
So we can talk about a few helpful sort of properties of this curve.

78
00:07:49,890 --> 00:07:53,760
So one of those is the C max or the concentration max.

79
00:07:53,760 --> 00:07:57,570
That's that peak of the toxicant concentrations in the body.

80
00:07:57,780 --> 00:08:07,010
So the highest concentration or maximum concentration in the body and associated with that, we have the T max or the time at which we hit that peak.

81
00:08:07,020 --> 00:08:15,380
So how long after we're exposed do we get a spike, the highest peak in the concentration of the toxicant?

82
00:08:16,770 --> 00:08:22,950
We can also think about what half see Max. So after we hit that peak, what is the half?

83
00:08:23,220 --> 00:08:34,250
Half of that concentration? And then we that brings us to Half-Life 40 one half the time at which we hit one half C max.

84
00:08:34,270 --> 00:08:37,660
After that, we get this sea max peak.

85
00:08:40,270 --> 00:08:48,460
Halfway. So pretty straightforward, I would say, for the most part.

86
00:08:48,470 --> 00:08:52,770
Right. Yeah.

87
00:08:53,870 --> 00:08:59,870
So in general we can think about like absorption from the gut again through with this, you know, for example,

88
00:08:59,870 --> 00:09:08,360
we have this curve, we have our R, C, max and T max and all the other of the parameters I just talked about.

89
00:09:09,380 --> 00:09:17,300
So what this reflects is that as the food as the food and that the toxicant associated with the food, for example, is being absorbed from the gut.

90
00:09:17,300 --> 00:09:21,650
It's going to be routed to the liver for essentially metabolic processing and

91
00:09:21,650 --> 00:09:25,160
things that we'll talk more about when we talk about the powder toxicity.

92
00:09:25,790 --> 00:09:29,780
The liver is going to send that through the main hepatic vein to the heart.

93
00:09:30,950 --> 00:09:36,380
And then what's in the heart? That blood is going to be sent to the lungs to be oxygenated and then sent back out to the heart,

94
00:09:36,580 --> 00:09:39,740
will then be routed to like broader systemic circulation.

95
00:09:40,490 --> 00:09:49,460
And so this buildup kind of reflects this time it takes to move across these different into these different compartments in the body.

96
00:09:52,030 --> 00:09:58,930
But you can imagine if we have a direct injection into the vein, you kind of essentially have a shorter pathway to get to the systemic circulation.

97
00:09:59,470 --> 00:10:04,000
And so what that's going to look like is kind of a shift in that curve where you get a greater amount of that

98
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:10,360
chemical essentially being dumped off into the systemic bloodstream and you get a higher peak at an earlier,

99
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:12,790
you get a higher peak and an earlier t max time.

100
00:10:14,790 --> 00:10:23,190
And then even more so with like inhalation, you have a very like fast route into the bloodstream after inhaling a chemical.

101
00:10:23,880 --> 00:10:28,040
And so that's reflected again, you could see here like a very high peak.

102
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:31,290
The stuff is just being like dumped almost like directly into the bloodstream.

103
00:10:31,470 --> 00:10:35,220
And it's happening. You see the peak happening at an earlier time point.

104
00:10:35,910 --> 00:10:41,370
Right. And so this is really important, both in terms of like toxicology, like occupational exposures.

105
00:10:41,370 --> 00:10:47,219
A lot of times we're talking about occupational exposures where people are breathing in chemicals,

106
00:10:47,220 --> 00:10:51,629
breathing in like these volatiles, chemicals, vapors, toxic vapors.

107
00:10:51,630 --> 00:10:55,090
So that kind of illustrates that, you know,

108
00:10:55,140 --> 00:11:01,800
this is an important sort of route of exposure in terms of what the blood concentration is going to look like and how fast you might see an effect.

109
00:11:02,070 --> 00:11:09,450
Like some chemicals, you can start breathing them in and see like neuro toxicological effects or disorientation or what have you like very quickly.

110
00:11:11,220 --> 00:11:15,420
Um, and then in addition, you know, for talking to like from the therapeutic side of things,

111
00:11:15,690 --> 00:11:21,509
if we're designing a drug and we want it to be at a certain concentration in the blood for a certain time period,

112
00:11:21,510 --> 00:11:25,979
we want it to be like maybe staying in the system for a longer period of time that maybe we're more

113
00:11:25,980 --> 00:11:31,200
favoring like an oral route of exposure as opposed to like some kind of inhalation like inhaler type of,

114
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:37,680
of exposure. We want to kind of like, you know, stretch that peak in that residence time of the body kind of out longer.

115
00:11:38,250 --> 00:11:41,910
So the route of exposure is important to like the shape of these curves.

116
00:11:46,270 --> 00:11:51,850
Let's see here. Yeah. And then so this is basically I just talked about. So which administration has the highest C-Max?

117
00:11:52,540 --> 00:11:59,020
So we can all see that it's the lung, right? And then which has the highest t max.

118
00:11:59,410 --> 00:12:02,820
It's kind of inverse. The highest t max would be the gut.

119
00:12:03,130 --> 00:12:13,550
It takes longer to hit that peak. So another helpful thing we can calculate is called the area under the curve.

120
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:16,400
And this may have been something you've heard about in other classes.

121
00:12:16,910 --> 00:12:25,790
And my understanding is that in different fields, the area under the curve can describe different types of things in toxicology.

122
00:12:25,790 --> 00:12:29,119
And in this class, it's pretty much exactly what it says.

123
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:34,250
It's the area under this concentration time curve here.

124
00:12:34,430 --> 00:12:39,440
So this that area here and this is a metric for total toxicant exposure.

125
00:12:42,790 --> 00:12:47,890
And kind of intuitively a higher area under the curve means a higher total toxicant exposure.

126
00:12:48,550 --> 00:12:55,510
So again, you could imagine like that peak kind of happening further out or like a very broad sort of curve or like a really high spike.

127
00:12:55,510 --> 00:13:04,089
And the area under the curve could kind of account for both of those of shapes in terms of you can understand that like a bigger area

128
00:13:04,090 --> 00:13:09,879
under the curve generally is going to follow this or a bigger area under the curve is going to mean a higher total toxicant exposure.

129
00:13:09,880 --> 00:13:14,440
So you can kind of compare across different chemicals in that way using this calculation.

130
00:13:18,100 --> 00:13:24,160
So area under the curve. There's a couple of things to think about in terms of calculating that.

131
00:13:24,220 --> 00:13:28,060
It's not a really hard calculation to do, and I'll walk through it in a few minutes.

132
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:39,280
But one thing to sort of understand is when we're doing like a concentration response study, like some kind of clinical study,

133
00:13:39,290 --> 00:13:45,520
for example, we're not like getting data at every single second from this person's bloodstream.

134
00:13:46,030 --> 00:13:50,530
That's not really feasible and would be probably a horrible experiment to be a part of.

135
00:13:52,060 --> 00:13:56,350
And so typically what you're doing is taking blood samples from defined time points.

136
00:13:57,010 --> 00:14:01,840
Right. So one hour, 2 hours, 3 hours, 4 hours, 6 hours.

137
00:14:02,610 --> 00:14:08,410
You're you're setting you're defining in advance, like, okay, this is how often we're going to be assessing the levels of this chemical in the blood.

138
00:14:08,680 --> 00:14:10,110
And so this is an estimation.

139
00:14:10,120 --> 00:14:15,669
So we have these data points and then we essentially are like modeling the dose response curve through those data points.

140
00:14:15,670 --> 00:14:21,500
Right? Yeah.

141
00:14:21,510 --> 00:14:27,010
So that's what I just said here. So we're approximating this dose response curve.

142
00:14:27,280 --> 00:14:32,260
If one day it becomes more feasible to continuously moderate, monitor the blood levels.

143
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:39,700
Then things might be different. But this is how it works out. So the actual data you have at hand might look more something like this.

144
00:14:40,030 --> 00:14:47,830
Right. So in order to estimate the AUC or the area under the curve, we use what's called the trapezoid method.

145
00:14:48,040 --> 00:14:56,050
And this is essentially taking the data and drawing a series of trapezoids and calculating the area of each trapezoid as you go through the data.

146
00:14:56,410 --> 00:14:59,680
And I'll show you how that works in the second year and then ask you to do it.

147
00:15:02,110 --> 00:15:10,670
So we could connect these data points like this. And then we can also connect you to the data points to the respective time points.

148
00:15:13,100 --> 00:15:17,000
And then we have concentrations at each time so we can say see one and see two.

149
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:23,740
And so each of these is like the trapezoids we're going to be getting the data for for the area for.

150
00:15:24,140 --> 00:15:27,980
And so you're basically going to calculate the area of each of these and then add them up.

151
00:15:30,670 --> 00:15:39,280
Right. So imagine we want to calculate this area that's given by this trapezoid formula that you may not have seen since geometry.

152
00:15:39,280 --> 00:15:45,550
I know it's not something I look at a lot, but essentially what you have is height, which is given by actually the x axis here.

153
00:15:46,090 --> 00:15:55,000
So the time so 1 to 2 hours is one and then you have the concentrations C one and C two divided by two.

154
00:15:55,270 --> 00:15:58,270
And that's going to give you the area fairly simple, right?

155
00:16:01,820 --> 00:16:06,620
And the idea here is like, if we could again, keep sampling like over and over.

156
00:16:07,010 --> 00:16:11,569
Yeah, you know, we could get like a really good approximation of what this curve looks like.

157
00:16:11,570 --> 00:16:14,870
We can actually, like, model a smooth curve through all these points.

158
00:16:14,870 --> 00:16:19,910
But, you know, we're constrained by, you know, the feasibility of how often we could take a blood sample.

159
00:16:20,180 --> 00:16:21,860
And so we do the best we can.

160
00:16:21,860 --> 00:16:27,200
And a lot of times we can get like a pretty good estimation of what these curves look like with the understanding that like,

161
00:16:27,200 --> 00:16:32,570
we don't have that continuous data that we're monitoring throughout the entire experiment.

162
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:43,630
So I'd like to turn it over to you and I'll give you 5 minutes if you need more, I can give you some more time.

163
00:16:44,380 --> 00:16:52,570
But I'd like you to. Given if you were given this set of data, calculate what the ABC of the area under the curve would be.

164
00:16:55,730 --> 00:17:03,160
So again, this is your formula. The H is equivalent is referring to the the time here.

165
00:17:03,170 --> 00:17:06,260
So like 1 to 2 hours, 2 to 3, etc.

166
00:17:08,500 --> 00:17:14,160
So I'll give you till. Ten 1022 1025.

167
00:17:14,280 --> 00:17:17,490
I'll check in and see if everyone started or if you want more time.

168
00:21:44,210 --> 00:21:50,970
How are we doing? Do you want more time to just go through it yet?

169
00:21:51,050 --> 00:21:58,320
Not see any requests for more time. So we'll just go through it. So why don't we just do the first piece?

170
00:21:58,340 --> 00:22:02,360
So this triangle shape here, what? What's the area of this?

171
00:22:03,050 --> 00:22:06,800
So I'm gonna shout it out or. 25.

172
00:22:07,880 --> 00:22:11,380
What is louder than 25? 25, right.

173
00:22:12,420 --> 00:22:16,060
And then this next one. Anyone.

174
00:22:19,410 --> 00:22:23,190
So it's in five. 75.

175
00:22:23,280 --> 00:22:29,479
Correct. Because your concentration one would be 50.

176
00:22:29,480 --> 00:22:35,309
Your concentration two would be 100 C of 150 divided by two is 75.

177
00:22:35,310 --> 00:22:38,520
And then the timeframe we're talking about is one hour, which is the height there.

178
00:22:38,520 --> 00:22:42,990
Right? So one times 75 and then we just go through the rest, right?

179
00:22:43,530 --> 00:22:47,550
So 87.5 50. Did anyone get the last one?

180
00:22:48,600 --> 00:22:51,720
Ten, 30, 30. Right.

181
00:22:52,050 --> 00:22:57,620
So there's a little bit of a trick there because it's a two hour time time difference instead of the one.

182
00:22:57,660 --> 00:23:02,190
So you had to multiply by two. So here are the units.

183
00:23:02,190 --> 00:23:05,580
They're kind of awkward units. KG for our director.

184
00:23:08,310 --> 00:23:12,420
Yeah. So did everyone get that or like understand how we get there?

185
00:23:12,420 --> 00:23:17,129
Got there be any problems?

186
00:23:17,130 --> 00:23:22,680
Just come to office hours. Of course I'm a broken record on that one and also email like so but yeah.

187
00:23:23,590 --> 00:23:33,810
So it's a general question which is would you normally like if you're modeling a curve between these points, you have to take control of that?

188
00:23:33,960 --> 00:23:37,260
Or are you always doing that between like the actual data points that you.

189
00:23:39,370 --> 00:23:44,920
Yeah, that's a good question. I think you can do it either, you know, see how they match up in your modeling.

190
00:23:45,010 --> 00:23:49,270
You know, I think a lot of times just using this popular method works pretty well.

191
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:52,630
But yeah, I think there's certainly, like, more sophisticated stuff you could do.

192
00:23:53,020 --> 00:23:59,530
Um, but yeah, you know, there may be benefits to like only sticking with the data you have.

193
00:23:59,650 --> 00:24:03,850
Yeah. As opposed to yeah. So, but yeah, that's a great, great point.

194
00:24:06,540 --> 00:24:09,480
Okay. So that is. And you see.

195
00:24:10,260 --> 00:24:19,920
And then I guess just just to let you know, like after today, I think you should have all the information you need to do the whole problem set.

196
00:24:20,370 --> 00:24:24,689
So if something is still not making sense or if there's a problem in the problem set, that doesn't make sense.

197
00:24:24,690 --> 00:24:28,920
We feel like we haven't gone over that. Please bring it to my attention and we'll talk about it.

198
00:24:29,100 --> 00:24:33,120
But I think we've covered after today, we should have covered everything that you'll need to do.

199
00:24:33,360 --> 00:24:37,020
The problem is and I think there's a question like this up there.

200
00:24:39,360 --> 00:24:43,770
Okay. So a little bit more of basic toxicol kinetics.

201
00:24:43,890 --> 00:24:49,050
Uh, so there's, there's different models that are used in terms of how we sort of.

202
00:24:51,050 --> 00:24:54,630
Think about how a chemical is going to behave once it gets into the body.

203
00:24:54,680 --> 00:24:57,980
And probably the most simple one of those is called the one compartment bottle.

204
00:24:58,640 --> 00:25:08,270
And in this case, what we're essentially assuming is that after exposure to a chemical, the body basically is essentially one homogenous unit.

205
00:25:08,740 --> 00:25:16,700
So we're exposed to a chemical, and the chemical is basically like distributed equally throughout the body, sort of in equilibrium.

206
00:25:16,700 --> 00:25:19,630
And there's no sort of like partitioning or anything.

207
00:25:19,640 --> 00:25:29,210
It's just the body is just one big unit that distributes into the tissues, into the bloodstream, all sort of like equally and yeah.

208
00:25:29,810 --> 00:25:34,760
And so the way this is sort of modeled is, you know, this would be your one compartment.

209
00:25:34,760 --> 00:25:42,710
So the body and you have constants of the absorption rate constant, which is modeling how fast the chemical is coming in.

210
00:25:43,100 --> 00:25:49,010
And then you also have an elimination rate constant, which is modeling how fast the chemical is going out.

211
00:25:49,460 --> 00:25:53,300
And so this is basically how much of the chemical is being absorbed or excreted per hour.

212
00:25:56,970 --> 00:25:58,049
And so we plot these.

213
00:25:58,050 --> 00:26:08,400
So we're going to change a little bit here from this sort of more gradual model of like a GI exposure where we're getting this bump up increase.

214
00:26:08,850 --> 00:26:14,520
When we're talking about this, we're going to be talking about a bolus IV injection.

215
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:20,610
So you just get injected with a drug and you see this basically instantaneous spike in the concentration of the blood.

216
00:26:21,660 --> 00:26:27,690
And so we're remodeling using this type of of exposure, using the one compartment model.

217
00:26:27,690 --> 00:26:31,979
The concentration concentration time curve is going to look like this.

218
00:26:31,980 --> 00:26:39,690
It's going to have this this curved shape to it. And this is basically sorry.

219
00:26:39,720 --> 00:26:43,410
This is basically what's happening here is the.

220
00:26:44,510 --> 00:26:47,660
You're basically taking the same amount of time to excrete.

221
00:26:49,190 --> 00:26:55,890
I want to say this The half life is going to be the same no matter what concentration of the chemical you have in your body.

222
00:26:55,910 --> 00:27:05,720
So if you have eight megs per liter of a chemical, the time it takes to go to four is the same as the time it takes to go from 4 to 2.

223
00:27:05,750 --> 00:27:08,480
So that's what's being reflected here with this curve.

224
00:27:09,080 --> 00:27:15,350
And then we can also plot this on the semi log scale to make things to turn this curve into a straight line,

225
00:27:15,740 --> 00:27:19,720
which we like to work with because they're a little bit easier and you'll see plotted here.

226
00:27:19,730 --> 00:27:24,380
So we have our constant half life t one half shown here.

227
00:27:25,400 --> 00:27:31,250
Our initial concentration is here and our half concentration is here.

228
00:27:32,460 --> 00:27:36,390
And so, again, reflective of this one compartment model.

229
00:27:36,690 --> 00:27:44,069
Essentially what we're assuming is that the chemical is partitioning into the plasma and tissue basically instantaneously.

230
00:27:44,070 --> 00:27:49,860
And then we're going to see the same rate of excretion drop off from like tissue and plasma,

231
00:27:50,040 --> 00:27:55,320
but it's going to be eliminated at the same rate because we're just assuming everything's one compartment.

232
00:27:58,230 --> 00:28:05,040
And so the equation given for if you want to know the concentration at a given time point, you have this given,

233
00:28:05,040 --> 00:28:15,150
but that's given by this equation here with initial concentration of the elimination rate constant in the time is of the natural logarithm there.

234
00:28:16,170 --> 00:28:22,139
When we're working in the log space, we can make it a little bit easier and take the log of both sides.

235
00:28:22,140 --> 00:28:28,620
So this case would be modeling this type of these type of data and basically it's taking the log.

236
00:28:28,620 --> 00:28:34,470
Both sides would give you this equation. So these are some handy equations that will help you in the homework.

237
00:28:38,440 --> 00:28:44,620
And we're basically looking at the slope of the line. This is what we call first order kinetics, i.e. the elimination.

238
00:28:44,620 --> 00:28:48,849
Half life is constant. It's not going to change anywhere in the body.

239
00:28:48,850 --> 00:28:53,620
We're going to see we're going to see basically everything is being excreted from the body, like basically at the same rate.

240
00:28:58,340 --> 00:29:01,370
One thing to note, I don't know if anyone's using the third edition textbook,

241
00:29:01,370 --> 00:29:06,570
but apparently the this equation is wrong in the third edition textbook and it's been corrected for the fourth edition.

242
00:29:07,070 --> 00:29:11,750
So please, for this equation, use either this slide or the fourth edition textbook.

243
00:29:16,450 --> 00:29:21,940
Yeah. Sorry I brought that up earlier, but this is initial concentration elimination constantly on time.

244
00:29:26,930 --> 00:29:33,170
Another handy equation we can calculate half life taking the natural log of two over this elimination rate constant.

245
00:29:34,790 --> 00:29:41,080
That's just a handy equation to have. Will probably help you on the homework. I might ask you the problem.

246
00:29:41,090 --> 00:29:46,220
How many half lives are required to clear 99% of a chemical from the body?

247
00:29:46,640 --> 00:29:50,660
So if we think about that, it would look something like this.

248
00:29:50,990 --> 00:29:52,340
We don't have to go through it all together.

249
00:29:52,340 --> 00:30:01,309
But if we think about the number of half lives, you know, 50% is eliminated and one 25% sarin gas that should be present eliminated,

250
00:30:01,310 --> 00:30:10,930
present percent like remaining 25% remaining after three have large you have 12.5 and on down.

251
00:30:10,940 --> 00:30:13,190
So if you extrapolate this out,

252
00:30:14,030 --> 00:30:21,860
at some point you're going to get below 1% and that's going to be how many half lives it takes to excrete 99% of that chemical out of the body.

253
00:30:28,500 --> 00:30:28,799
Right.

254
00:30:28,800 --> 00:30:40,560
And so when you're given data like on your problem set, you might be given a series of points and has to essentially fit a curve through those points.

255
00:30:41,280 --> 00:30:47,820
So you could do that using, you know, Excel's model fitting software or whatever your favorite program is.

256
00:30:49,680 --> 00:30:53,700
And again, you're just going to use these equations, whichever you prefer.

257
00:30:53,880 --> 00:30:59,710
I don't have one specific one you need to use and get your line of best fit through the points.

258
00:31:00,480 --> 00:31:05,880
And then from that fit, you should then be able to once you generate an equation that describes that line,

259
00:31:06,180 --> 00:31:12,450
you should be able to, you know, plug in the numbers you're given to find some other concentration.

260
00:31:12,450 --> 00:31:16,500
For example, given these data, some reasonable.

261
00:31:17,820 --> 00:31:28,110
Do you have any for that equation on the I guess your left that's log base ten there and then it's or is it natural log this is log base time.

262
00:31:28,170 --> 00:31:31,950
Just make sorry about that. Yeah I should I meant to put it in a ten for that.

263
00:31:32,160 --> 00:31:38,120
Yeah. This is log base tab. This is just a conversion of the still alive based on here.

264
00:31:42,490 --> 00:31:45,640
Change. Okay.

265
00:31:45,820 --> 00:31:50,530
So another important factor to think about is the volume of distribution.

266
00:31:51,310 --> 00:31:53,470
So the volume distribution is.

267
00:31:54,540 --> 00:31:59,860
Because it says here a concept that relates the total amount of a chemical in the body to its concentration in a plasma.

268
00:32:00,430 --> 00:32:04,569
And the idea here is that actually most of the fluid in the body is not taken up by the plasma.

269
00:32:04,570 --> 00:32:10,690
It's found in like other areas of the body, such as interstitial fluid or most of it's actually an intracellular fluid.

270
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:17,380
So remember we talked about how cells are just basically like bags of water in a very crude sense.

271
00:32:17,620 --> 00:32:25,000
So there's a lot of stuff actually contained within cells. And so the volume of and so what this is.

272
00:32:26,190 --> 00:32:33,299
But to describe it essentially is if we're told that a chemical if someone starts of a chemical and we see a very low

273
00:32:33,300 --> 00:32:40,920
concentration are we can't account for that the total mass of that chemical in the levels that we see in the blood,

274
00:32:41,040 --> 00:32:46,200
it's going somewhere else in the body not and we're not measuring it in the plants.

275
00:32:46,210 --> 00:32:49,320
But we'll talk about it'll be it should be a little bit more clear after the next slide.

276
00:32:50,540 --> 00:32:54,589
So this is a theoretical volume that would be necessary to contain the total amount

277
00:32:54,590 --> 00:32:59,180
of a given toxicant at the same concentration it is observed in the plasma.

278
00:32:59,600 --> 00:33:07,850
And you could calculate that given your dose and these other other factors, you have the elimination rate constant in the area under the curve.

279
00:33:13,320 --> 00:33:18,200
And so the. So that should be a handy equation again for your problem set.

280
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:24,150
So the way to think about this is not immediately. This is another one of those concepts.

281
00:33:24,150 --> 00:33:31,320
It's not like I know it wasn't at least like immediately intuitive to me, but this visualization helps me think about it.

282
00:33:32,430 --> 00:33:40,380
So we have imagine we have the same amount or the same mass of three different chemicals that we'd give to a subject or a patient.

283
00:33:40,920 --> 00:33:45,240
And we can imagine three different ways that this chemical in general is going to distribute within the body.

284
00:33:45,660 --> 00:33:53,430
So we might have a case where after we inject someone with this chemical, we can account for most of that chemical in the blood.

285
00:33:54,570 --> 00:34:00,480
And some of it, though, is going to distribute into like extra vascular tissues or elsewhere in the body.

286
00:34:01,260 --> 00:34:05,280
We could imagine a situation where a different chemical distributes kind of relatively evenly,

287
00:34:05,280 --> 00:34:10,110
so we can account for maybe like half of the mass of that chemical by looking at the blood of that individual.

288
00:34:11,070 --> 00:34:14,580
And then we can have the on the other extreme end of things,

289
00:34:14,910 --> 00:34:20,250
a chemical where very little of it is found in the blood and the chemicals distributing elsewhere,

290
00:34:20,280 --> 00:34:24,450
fat, whatever, bone somewhere else in the body, not the blood.

291
00:34:25,560 --> 00:34:38,430
And so the idea is the volume of distribution is the volume of the volume that we would need to put better on the slide of the

292
00:34:38,820 --> 00:34:44,670
volume that would be necessary to contain the total amount of a given toxicant at the same concentration absorbed in the plasma.

293
00:34:44,670 --> 00:34:48,980
So. Essentially, if you think about a bigger volume,

294
00:34:49,580 --> 00:34:54,320
like if you have the same amount of chemical and you have a bigger volume, is it going to be more or less concentrated?

295
00:34:57,030 --> 00:35:01,030
It's going to be less concentrated, right? You have a really big volume.

296
00:35:01,100 --> 00:35:06,959
Like if I dilute five grams in one liter, it's going to be, you know, one degree of concentration.

297
00:35:06,960 --> 00:35:11,700
But if I if I dilute five grams in like 100 liters, it's going to be much less concentrated.

298
00:35:12,360 --> 00:35:17,459
So that bigger volume indicates that you have much less concentration of a particular substance.

299
00:35:17,460 --> 00:35:25,080
Right. So looking at these three chemicals, one, two and three, which one do you think has the highest volume of distribution?

300
00:35:29,190 --> 00:35:42,380
Do you want to hazard a guess? Well, if we think about it, a bigger volume means more or less concentration.

301
00:35:43,630 --> 00:35:48,280
With less a less concentrated giving the same mass of a substance.

302
00:35:48,280 --> 00:35:52,240
Right. So here, which one of these is the least concentrated?

303
00:35:54,010 --> 00:35:57,760
The terror in the blood. In the blood. Sorry. And the vascular component.

304
00:35:59,210 --> 00:36:03,690
Three. It's the bottom one, right?

305
00:36:04,380 --> 00:36:08,830
So it's least the least concentrated in the vascular component or the plasma.

306
00:36:08,850 --> 00:36:12,350
So what I'm getting at is this would be a low volume distribution.

307
00:36:12,360 --> 00:36:15,839
This would be medium and this would be high. And so, you know,

308
00:36:15,840 --> 00:36:23,340
kind of maybe a more intuitive way to think about this is a higher volume distribution means that this chemical is distributing elsewhere in the body,

309
00:36:23,640 --> 00:36:26,820
not in the blood, not in the plasma.

310
00:36:27,810 --> 00:36:33,060
It's basically telling us and, you know, that's something that we want to know if the chemicals going elsewhere in the body,

311
00:36:33,060 --> 00:36:39,980
it could be doing damage or having some kind of really important biological effect that we don't we don't really know.

312
00:36:39,990 --> 00:36:44,250
But, you know, we know, you know, a certain amount of information knowing what the blood concentration is.

313
00:36:44,250 --> 00:36:48,180
But we really want to know where that chemical, where else that chemical might be going.

314
00:36:48,930 --> 00:36:58,590
Is the blood concentration reflective of the concentration of the chemical elsewhere, like in fat or in the liver tissue, this type of thing?

315
00:36:58,740 --> 00:37:05,460
So that's one way we kind of use this this this calculation.

316
00:37:09,790 --> 00:37:11,650
Okay. So we also have the clearance rate.

317
00:37:12,310 --> 00:37:18,310
Again, these are all kind of related to each other, as you can see, like these variables are popping up in terms of the equation.

318
00:37:18,680 --> 00:37:26,500
So like the clearance rate is given by dose over the area under the curve or the volume distribution times, the elimination constant.

319
00:37:27,310 --> 00:37:34,930
So clearance rate is the rate of chemical elimination, elimination in a volume of fluids containing chemical per unit of time.

320
00:37:36,220 --> 00:37:44,500
So essentially a clearance rate of two liters per hour means that two liters of toxicant containing plasma is cleared of that substance.

321
00:37:44,530 --> 00:37:50,050
So it's how much of the blood has been cleared of the toxicant in a given unit of time?

322
00:37:50,260 --> 00:37:52,570
That's a little bit counterintuitive.

323
00:37:53,310 --> 00:38:00,730
You know, you're basically understanding how much of the chemical is being removed from the total blood in a given unit of time.

324
00:38:00,730 --> 00:38:07,180
But it's the idea is that, you know, in some cases we want to maintain or be below a certain blood concentration.

325
00:38:07,480 --> 00:38:12,160
And so this helps us in understanding how to kind of maintain a certain concentration of a chemical.

326
00:38:16,410 --> 00:38:19,530
Okay. So that's for a one compartment model. Now,

327
00:38:20,700 --> 00:38:25,319
moving into the two compartment models is a little bit more complicated and a little

328
00:38:25,320 --> 00:38:31,260
bit better at describing how certain chemicals are moving throughout the body.

329
00:38:32,160 --> 00:38:36,420
So in this case, we're assuming that we still have a central compartment.

330
00:38:36,420 --> 00:38:38,910
So we have the body like most of the body.

331
00:38:39,150 --> 00:38:43,680
But some of this chemical is being distributed to some peripheral tissue, like some other tissue in the body.

332
00:38:44,070 --> 00:38:49,550
So, you know, a certain percentage of it maybe distributing into the fat versus the rest of the body.

333
00:38:49,560 --> 00:38:52,820
Right. Yeah.

334
00:38:52,880 --> 00:38:58,250
We're assuming the chemical requires longer time to reach equilibrium with these peripheral tissues.

335
00:38:58,250 --> 00:39:03,860
So eventually the chemical is going to distribute between the central and peripheral tissues and reach some kind of equilibrium.

336
00:39:04,310 --> 00:39:06,170
So we still have our absorption constant.

337
00:39:06,530 --> 00:39:13,940
We have this these two distribution constants of the chemical being uptake it into the peripheral tissue and then back into the central compartment.

338
00:39:14,240 --> 00:39:17,930
And then we have such essentially our elimination constant here.

339
00:39:21,660 --> 00:39:25,140
So this is going to look a little bit different when we plot it out.

340
00:39:27,730 --> 00:39:32,500
So for one, the decline that we observe, if we're like taking measurements over time,

341
00:39:32,500 --> 00:39:37,899
the decline that we observe in the plasma is initially going to be due to both elimination

342
00:39:37,900 --> 00:39:41,470
because we going to start metabolizing and excreting that chemical right away.

343
00:39:41,800 --> 00:39:45,190
But then you can have a certain amount that's distributing into this peripheral compartment.

344
00:39:45,460 --> 00:39:54,440
So the blood. So initially you're going to see like a higher rate of decline in blood concentration as it distributes out and you are excreting it.

345
00:39:54,460 --> 00:39:56,740
So it's like going into two places initially.

346
00:39:57,310 --> 00:40:03,040
Then there's going to be this kind of like equilibrium that's reached and then the decline is going to be associated with only elimination.

347
00:40:06,500 --> 00:40:13,370
And so this is kind of you can see graphed here is like a steeper curve or a steeper drop off.

348
00:40:14,270 --> 00:40:15,350
Yeah, I guess a steeper curve.

349
00:40:16,310 --> 00:40:24,469
And then what we graph in the log space, we are actually not going to see a straight line for the entire concentration time curve.

350
00:40:24,470 --> 00:40:27,890
We're going to see two lines of one of it,

351
00:40:27,890 --> 00:40:34,760
which is going to describe this distribution portion where we're seeing this steep drop off and then this other sort of.

352
00:40:35,300 --> 00:40:39,110
So it's going to curve into this like when the steady state is reached and we're getting

353
00:40:39,110 --> 00:40:47,420
all of the drop off is due to excretion elimination and not due to distribution.

354
00:40:49,430 --> 00:40:55,729
Let's see here. Right. And so this is given by in this case, alpha and beta.

355
00:40:55,730 --> 00:41:01,340
So Alpha is describing this distribution phase and then the beat is describing this overall elimination phase.

356
00:41:02,430 --> 00:41:10,560
I guess I should say this Alpha is describing the distribution and elimination phase and that data is just describing the elimination only phase.

357
00:41:11,790 --> 00:41:18,540
And so the way this works is you have your central tissue you're going to get you know, this is, again,

358
00:41:18,540 --> 00:41:27,330
with the case of a just a direct injection of a chemical, you're going to get an increase in your central tissue like the central compartment.

359
00:41:27,810 --> 00:41:30,600
And then you have graphed here the peripheral tissue.

360
00:41:31,020 --> 00:41:39,180
And so over time, you're going to get an increase in this peripheral tissue and then again, a steeper decrease in the amount in the plasma.

361
00:41:39,840 --> 00:41:43,260
And then eventually it's going to essentially like all equal out and you're going to have the

362
00:41:43,260 --> 00:41:48,990
same rate of excretion from all of the compartments that's given by this following equation.

363
00:41:50,190 --> 00:41:56,320
It's the same equation, but you're just adding of the factor of the distribution.

364
00:41:56,370 --> 00:42:00,690
Sorry. So this will describe the distribution and this will describe the elimination.

365
00:42:04,810 --> 00:42:08,040
So this is a little bit better at describing for certain chemicals.

366
00:42:08,050 --> 00:42:13,990
You know, the the one compartment model works for certain chemicals. The two compartment model describes certain chemicals better.

367
00:42:13,990 --> 00:42:17,830
So it just kind of depends on the actual behavior of that chemical that you're looking at.

368
00:42:21,160 --> 00:42:24,100
So we have different types of elimination.

369
00:42:24,880 --> 00:42:32,860
We have what's called first order kinetics, which this is this case of this constant half life across all concentrations of the chemical.

370
00:42:33,580 --> 00:42:38,470
You're excreting more chemical at higher concentrations and less of the chemical at lower concentrations.

371
00:42:38,950 --> 00:42:42,460
Most pharmaceuticals work that way and show those types of kinetics.

372
00:42:43,300 --> 00:42:49,030
However, there are what we call zero order kinetics in which and we usually see this in the

373
00:42:49,030 --> 00:42:53,200
case where a chemical needs to be metabolized by an enzyme before it's eliminated.

374
00:42:55,540 --> 00:42:59,410
And so this is where we're seeing a constant rate across all concentrations.

375
00:43:00,520 --> 00:43:03,370
So it doesn't matter how much you have, you're still excreting like the same amount.

376
00:43:03,490 --> 00:43:09,730
And a good example of this is with ethanol, as the body can only process about ten grams of ethanol per hour.

377
00:43:09,820 --> 00:43:11,140
So you have that like limit.

378
00:43:11,710 --> 00:43:17,260
And what this shows is that the enzyme can be saturated, but you only have so much of the enzyme that's available to do this work.

379
00:43:17,650 --> 00:43:19,990
And so if you have more, it kind of doesn't matter.

380
00:43:20,620 --> 00:43:25,030
It's working as hard as it can, you know, more than that limit, you know, it's working as hard as it can.

381
00:43:25,060 --> 00:43:35,600
You're still going to be excreting at that same rate. So that brings us to physiologically based models.

382
00:43:35,780 --> 00:43:41,210
So so that's called physiologically based kinetic models of pharmacokinetic models.

383
00:43:42,020 --> 00:43:47,540
So this is where we're trying to you know, we've shown you these models like one compartment, two compartment.

384
00:43:48,470 --> 00:43:55,280
These are pretty good for some chemicals, but not all chemicals in terms of estimating the kinetics.

385
00:43:55,280 --> 00:44:02,030
Right. And so there is a whole field essentially dedicated to improving on this and

386
00:44:02,360 --> 00:44:07,850
understanding the actual the actual distribution of chemicals in multiple organs.

387
00:44:08,100 --> 00:44:13,159
You know, how much is going to the liver over time versus how much is being distributed to the kidneys, etc.?

388
00:44:13,160 --> 00:44:20,149
And you're really trying to fully integrate the anatomical aspects of each of the tissues

389
00:44:20,150 --> 00:44:26,300
to the known physiological processes that these that are interacting with these chemicals.

390
00:44:27,110 --> 00:44:35,569
And you end up building like pretty complex models in which you have essentially all the major organ systems are modeled as a one compartment model.

391
00:44:35,570 --> 00:44:43,730
And then you have like the blood flow connecting them. We're really in this case, we're trying to be more biologically relevant by, you know,

392
00:44:43,750 --> 00:44:48,250
really understanding the anatomy, physiology of the body and incorporating that into building the models.

393
00:44:52,670 --> 00:44:56,090
And it could look something like this. So you have these like locked compartments.

394
00:44:56,090 --> 00:45:01,280
So you have, again, the chemical. So this would be these vascular space here, the interstitial space,

395
00:45:01,280 --> 00:45:06,739
and this would be the intracellular space of like we could say this is a for instance,

396
00:45:06,740 --> 00:45:11,690
like a, a blood vessel and then uptake into a, I don't know, a liver cell.

397
00:45:12,200 --> 00:45:16,210
And so you're modeling based basically the movement of the chemical through the bloodstream and you're

398
00:45:16,820 --> 00:45:23,120
modeling the uptake and then you may have some of the chemical kind of diffusing back out depending.

399
00:45:24,050 --> 00:45:31,730
And then you can even get down to the the level of understanding what the chemical inside a cell is doing,

400
00:45:31,730 --> 00:45:38,120
what particular binding sites the chemical is interacting with, such as like estrogen receptors, for example.

401
00:45:39,200 --> 00:45:45,290
So you can really get like pretty detailed with this. And this is really going to help us, you know, if we could do this successfully,

402
00:45:45,470 --> 00:45:52,790
help us understand the toxicity of this chemical in a really, like a really fundamental and important way.

403
00:45:54,600 --> 00:45:59,350
Let's see if there's anything else here. Yeah.

404
00:45:59,390 --> 00:46:05,240
I think we'll talk about free inbound. So yeah, we'll talk about free inbound I think in the next Adbe lecture.

405
00:46:06,050 --> 00:46:12,200
Yeah. So you have your chemical coming in, coming out of your anything else on that slide.

406
00:46:13,130 --> 00:46:20,540
So over. So these physiologically based models have a lot of advantages.

407
00:46:20,540 --> 00:46:28,189
They can model the time course of distribution. We can see if we alter the effects of a certain parameter.

408
00:46:28,190 --> 00:46:30,650
How does that change? Like the way the chemical is distributed?

409
00:46:30,860 --> 00:46:41,149
If a if an individual has like a, for example, a polymorphism in one of the genes that is responsible for metabolizing this chemical,

410
00:46:41,150 --> 00:46:47,590
how does that change the overall kinetics of the chemical? Because they can model that and, you know, a computational model.

411
00:46:50,150 --> 00:46:54,500
We can also use this to like help us understand how effects could vary across species.

412
00:46:55,100 --> 00:46:57,919
You know, we know really the physiology of a rat really.

413
00:46:57,920 --> 00:47:05,059
Well, we can model a certain type and we can also, you know, develop actual experimental experimental data from a rat model.

414
00:47:05,060 --> 00:47:08,480
And then if we know how to like interpret that in the context of a human,

415
00:47:08,480 --> 00:47:15,020
it can really help us understand how to extrapolate across species and help inform us on whether that

416
00:47:15,260 --> 00:47:20,629
ten fold factor that we use in risk assessment is accurate in that particular case for that chemical?

417
00:47:20,630 --> 00:47:24,260
Or is there some kind of modifying factor we would need to incorporate?

418
00:47:27,320 --> 00:47:34,520
Yeah. And so it can accommodate just, you know, basically the complex dosing processes of metabolism, again, like receptor binding.

419
00:47:34,520 --> 00:47:39,530
These kind of like really small scale effects could be potentially like used in these types of models.

420
00:47:41,230 --> 00:47:44,680
But there are some disadvantages. It's very data intensive.

421
00:47:45,010 --> 00:47:51,000
It's complex, complex mathematics for biologists. I'm a biologist, so I'm not a mathematician.

422
00:47:51,010 --> 00:47:56,590
So to me it looks very complex. But maybe it's someone who's more has more of a background in mathematics.

423
00:47:56,920 --> 00:48:03,129
Some of these models don't look and, you know, if you start to look into them, maybe they don't look that complex to you, which is great.

424
00:48:03,130 --> 00:48:06,520
But to me, a lot of them look pretty, pretty involved.

425
00:48:08,020 --> 00:48:17,140
And again, we're sort of limited by the data we have. So do we have data for like this chemical in a rat or do we know how it's moving in the blood?

426
00:48:17,410 --> 00:48:21,069
A lot of times, like with arsenic, we can't really do ethical experiments.

427
00:48:21,070 --> 00:48:28,590
But where we give people a dose of arsenic, for example, because that's not really going to have any benefit and it's only really going to be harmful.

428
00:48:28,600 --> 00:48:31,840
Right. So there's a lot of data that we don't know, are we?

429
00:48:31,930 --> 00:48:41,139
We're not able to do that particular experiment. And so that data that we're generating is if we don't have that data to incorporate into the model.

430
00:48:41,140 --> 00:48:44,740
So that limits the utility of that model or our confidence in that model.

431
00:48:44,740 --> 00:48:49,629
So you might have a case where you are guessing that you have a certain concentration in the liver,

432
00:48:49,630 --> 00:48:55,800
but you have like pretty big error bars in terms of your confidence around what you're, you know, what you're modeling there.

433
00:48:55,850 --> 00:48:59,169
So okay.

434
00:48:59,170 --> 00:49:02,680
So with that, would it be okay?

435
00:49:03,730 --> 00:49:10,540
I was thinking, you know, that was fairly quick that we might end a little bit early today and you guys could focus on the problems that

436
00:49:10,720 --> 00:49:18,010
take this time to focus on the problems that you can hang around and come talk to me if you have questions.

437
00:49:18,010 --> 00:49:24,430
But I thought it might be a good time since after like I said, after this lecture,

438
00:49:24,430 --> 00:49:27,970
I think you should have all the info you need to do the entire problems that.

439
00:49:28,540 --> 00:49:36,369
So I thought it'd be nice to maybe take this however many half hour to just an extra half hour do it with it what you will if you want to leave it,

440
00:49:36,370 --> 00:49:43,150
go work on the problem set. Great. If you want to stick around for the rest until like 1120 is that and before that.

441
00:49:45,550 --> 00:49:53,020
So I'll be here until 1120. It looks everyone takes off, but I'll be here till 1120 to talk about the issues.

442
00:49:53,050 --> 00:49:56,470
You might be having problems in the next.

443
00:49:57,230 --> 00:50:00,100
The next lecture, which is Wednesday,

444
00:50:00,460 --> 00:50:06,430
if I am not totally off of will be Laurie's have a voter who is in the Department of Environmental Health Sciences.

445
00:50:06,430 --> 00:50:09,610
She'll be talking about the first part of the Carcinogenesis lecture.

446
00:50:10,150 --> 00:50:15,940
So we'll be talking about actual like toxic effects of chemicals and not just like the response modeling stuff.

447
00:50:15,940 --> 00:50:20,349
So I'm kind of excited to like move into that because we spent a lot of time on this kind of stuff.

448
00:50:20,350 --> 00:50:25,089
So, and she is like super awesome. So excited to hear what she has to say.

449
00:50:25,090 --> 00:50:30,580
So yeah, hopefully that works out for everyone. Office hours, email, yadda yadda.

450
00:50:31,060 --> 00:50:35,560
You got it. So I have a good day, I guess.
