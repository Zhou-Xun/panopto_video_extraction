1
00:00:01,200 --> 00:00:08,760
And start recording. So anybody that's been watching the.

2
00:00:14,130 --> 00:00:22,950
eBay's been watching the homepage of the course website for the last 24 hours has been watching my internal struggle with,

3
00:00:22,950 --> 00:00:27,770
like, how much I cram into today. It was it was real.

4
00:00:27,780 --> 00:00:31,889
So and then my daughter has a respiratory illness which like it's a real drag,

5
00:00:31,890 --> 00:00:35,600
being the daughter of a respiratory virus epidemiologist and to come home with a sore throat.

6
00:00:35,610 --> 00:00:47,250
So I've been like watching all day being like, what do you have? So I decided she has pure influenza virus, but that's just my own interpretation.

7
00:00:48,060 --> 00:00:57,810
So this is what we're going to do today. This list was actually longer earlier this week, but, um, we are going to do two student presentations.

8
00:00:58,680 --> 00:01:02,219
We're going to do the work, the Rift Valley Fever Workshop.

9
00:01:02,220 --> 00:01:08,370
And I am, and I know that was delayed from last week, but I do think there's some really interesting stuff to talk about there.

10
00:01:08,370 --> 00:01:12,299
I want to keep it. So I'm going to give you a bunch of time to do the Rift Valley Fever Workshop.

11
00:01:12,300 --> 00:01:16,350
I have new work groups for you and figured out how to display it on canvas.

12
00:01:16,350 --> 00:01:17,370
Yeah, I'm still working on it,

13
00:01:17,370 --> 00:01:29,730
but I'll put them up on the screen and then I'm going to reserve about 25 minutes for a short lecture on Arboviruses and then a mini kind of

14
00:01:30,540 --> 00:01:40,290
a just two or three slides to introduce polio vaccination in advance of the workshop that you're going to do asynchronously next Monday.

15
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:45,300
So we do not have class in this room next Monday. You are welcome to come, but I won't be here.

16
00:01:45,810 --> 00:01:50,610
There will be an assigned workshop for readings. And you are?

17
00:01:51,150 --> 00:01:55,290
You are welcome to work on them with a group you can self select your own groups if it's asynchronous.

18
00:01:55,290 --> 00:02:04,170
I'm not going to assign groups and the workshop will be due on Wednesday and on Wednesday the 26th, we'll have some student presentations.

19
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:09,210
We'll discuss what you did in the workshop, and then I'll do the full polio vaccination lecture.

20
00:02:09,420 --> 00:02:13,530
I really I just really enjoyed that lecture and I didn't want to do it as a taped lecture.

21
00:02:13,530 --> 00:02:24,329
So we're going to do polio for for polio on Wednesday after that, I think, as we arrange the order of topics in this class.

22
00:02:24,330 --> 00:02:33,629
So that's sort of some of the probably what you're saying. But then if I think we're going to close out animal human interface with Ebola and

23
00:02:33,630 --> 00:02:37,890
rabies and then move into some of these kind of surveillance and control topics,

24
00:02:38,610 --> 00:02:45,120
um, the animal, actually, the animal human interface, it used to, if we finished the class early,

25
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:49,360
the class material earlier, I used to let the students vote what virus we had covered.

26
00:02:49,380 --> 00:02:52,590
They wanted added and rabies.

27
00:02:52,770 --> 00:02:56,880
Like for the first three years it was always rabies. So now I just teach races.

28
00:02:57,210 --> 00:03:02,940
So we're going to we're going to do that next. And that will be Halloween I'll have to think about.

29
00:03:02,940 --> 00:03:11,099
So, hey, it's my dream that I can get all the infectious disease faculty to dress up like different disease vectors on Halloween.

30
00:03:11,100 --> 00:03:16,830
I've wanted it for years. I'm the only one that ever does it. But now I have all the costumes, a cow of a chicken and a bear.

31
00:03:17,130 --> 00:03:24,870
If I have a cat for people who are all like I have all of the costumes but actually don't know what a good Ebola rabies costume would be.

32
00:03:24,870 --> 00:03:30,260
So you know something for the doctor and they because somebody was put doctor,

33
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:34,380
maybe Carrie Borkowski is like the only person that they game for costumes.

34
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:39,719
So if I come up with anything for Ebola and rabies, I will show up in that costume.

35
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:43,170
Maybe you see how the year I wear the chicken costume,

36
00:03:43,980 --> 00:03:50,050
I missed the bus on the way in the class and instead of the bus wearing a full on singing costume,

37
00:03:50,340 --> 00:03:56,430
I've been down, watched it on where the chicken was crossing the river.

38
00:03:57,210 --> 00:04:03,330
It's very embarrassing. All right. With that, I think the students of the student presentations will be better than that.

39
00:04:05,130 --> 00:04:10,350
So let's go ahead. And I would do either you want to go first.

40
00:04:10,590 --> 00:04:15,630
Do you both if you kind of want to go first? Well, your closest race, would you come up first?

41
00:04:17,580 --> 00:04:21,100
You've got a tab with your slides right here. All right.

42
00:04:23,770 --> 00:04:27,430
Oh, ingrates. I made a little bit of progress but me in the greater still catching up.

43
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:32,940
Statement. Right.

44
00:04:35,910 --> 00:04:39,150
Okay. The scarf is about everything.

45
00:04:39,570 --> 00:04:44,720
Here we go. The button to turn it on as well. Okay. This you can hold or clip to your.

46
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:53,520
You can just give it to your the strength of your shirt, but it'll work just fine.

47
00:05:07,730 --> 00:05:13,480
Okay. Is that too loud?

48
00:05:13,690 --> 00:05:17,740
Yes. You mean? Yeah. Okay. All right.

49
00:05:17,980 --> 00:05:23,200
So, good morning, everyone. My name is Shashi Watson.

50
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:27,370
And on behalf of my colleagues, I would like to present you the results of our study.

51
00:05:27,850 --> 00:05:32,200
Human norovirus targets entero, endocrine epithelial cells in the small intestine.

52
00:05:34,060 --> 00:05:41,080
Just a brief introduction of norovirus. It is a non enveloped, positive, single stranded RNA virus, so it falls under Baltimore Class four.

53
00:05:41,620 --> 00:05:48,250
It's the primary cause of gastroenteritis diarrhea commonly known as stomach bug or stomach flu.

54
00:05:48,520 --> 00:05:50,260
Although it's not, the flu is a separate virus.

55
00:05:51,280 --> 00:06:00,460
And actually, although it causes acute infection, normally we do see a chronic infection in some individuals, particularly immunocompromised folks.

56
00:06:01,390 --> 00:06:09,610
And also it's been posited that there are possibly asymptomatic chronic shedders of more virus that cause new outbreaks.

57
00:06:09,610 --> 00:06:13,270
So because of that, it's a really important candidate for vaccine usage.

58
00:06:14,710 --> 00:06:17,720
You can see here on the slide of the BP one protein here,

59
00:06:17,740 --> 00:06:24,819
the capsule protein that's needed for entry of the virus into the cells and into the main antigenic portion of the virus.

60
00:06:24,820 --> 00:06:30,970
So that is most likely what vaccine to be made against and it has a high transmission rate in the community.

61
00:06:31,900 --> 00:06:38,020
So although it's a really important candidate for vaccine research, as of now, there are still no antivirals or vaccines that have been made.

62
00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:42,340
And to make matters worse, there are no good cell culture systems for norovirus,

63
00:06:42,730 --> 00:06:46,410
and that's really due to our poor understanding of its pathogenesis in host.

64
00:06:47,530 --> 00:06:56,019
Now we've done some studies with Marine Norovirus or MMV and we did find that they were present in top.

65
00:06:56,020 --> 00:06:59,739
So you can see some cells. They're not super common and you have to feel them,

66
00:06:59,740 --> 00:07:07,420
but they have a really important role in type two immune response, and that's against parasitic infections.

67
00:07:07,420 --> 00:07:11,440
That's the complete response that we would want for a virus infection.

68
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:17,709
So that could potentially explain the chronic symptoms you're seeing in some people, but we don't know for sure.

69
00:07:17,710 --> 00:07:21,760
And since tropism in humans is not yet known,

70
00:07:22,270 --> 00:07:32,290
our study hopes to investigate if the tropism of human norovirus was the same as mirroring our OH and in addition to infecting cells,

71
00:07:32,290 --> 00:07:38,439
we also saw that nearly more virus was infecting macrophages, dendritic cells, T cells and B cells actively replicating in them.

72
00:07:38,440 --> 00:07:41,170
So we wanted to see if this was true in humans as well.

73
00:07:43,540 --> 00:07:49,810
So to do this, we took stool samples from four norovirus positive and two norovirus negative patients.

74
00:07:50,050 --> 00:07:53,920
Quick statement. All samples were taken with written and informed consent.

75
00:07:55,240 --> 00:08:01,510
We had we did determine the norovirus strain to be G 2.4, which is the main one pathogenic in humans.

76
00:08:02,350 --> 00:08:07,780
We determined the presence of norovirus RNA through reverse transcriptase Q PCR and sequencing of nucleotides.

77
00:08:08,710 --> 00:08:13,870
We did and discovered biopsies between them from patients, suction them and then cryogenic stains.

78
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:20,890
We use RNA scope processes like the positive and negative sense RNA presence to determine if active replication was occurring.

79
00:08:21,820 --> 00:08:25,330
We did immunofluorescence assay several in fact for viral RNA,

80
00:08:25,330 --> 00:08:30,430
BP one antigen and various cell markers to determine where the virus was present and in what cells.

81
00:08:30,940 --> 00:08:38,380
This will be made clear in the results slides. We made progress to amplify the virus RNA to detect its presence.

82
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:43,180
A primary antibody was made against the RNA, BP one antigen and various cell markers,

83
00:08:43,570 --> 00:08:49,450
and a secondary antibody was applied with the force of TEG and confocal microscopy was used to image for all of them.

84
00:08:52,060 --> 00:08:58,480
So what did we find? A, B, D and E here are all taken from infected individuals C and F.

85
00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:02,200
Here are our control taken from non-infected individuals.

86
00:09:02,860 --> 00:09:07,630
So here they were really staining for BP, wanting oxygen, and where it was present,

87
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:12,100
we took biopsies from the small intestine, various parts of the small intestine as well as the colon.

88
00:09:12,430 --> 00:09:16,509
We did not see any presence of the one antigen or the army in the colon.

89
00:09:16,510 --> 00:09:19,810
We made this line in the small intestine, particularly the vagina here.

90
00:09:20,950 --> 00:09:25,719
And you can see that the BP one antigen, the brown staining at the top there, it's really present.

91
00:09:25,720 --> 00:09:29,770
Mainly the epithelial layer is on the field there as well as in the lab.

92
00:09:29,790 --> 00:09:34,779
In appropriate and in imagery, we see a high concentration of BP one around Gulf.

93
00:09:34,780 --> 00:09:37,690
So that was kind of important image to focus on for us.

94
00:09:38,590 --> 00:09:46,840
And in particular, we see a similar presence of positive strand of norovirus RNA as compared to the BP one very similar patterns here.

95
00:09:48,760 --> 00:09:52,629
So we did see that we because it was mainly present in the small intestine,

96
00:09:52,630 --> 00:09:58,240
we could prove that the replication was mainly occurring in small intestine during infection.

97
00:10:00,850 --> 00:10:04,899
So then if you wanted to determine where replication was occurring,

98
00:10:04,900 --> 00:10:12,850
we screen for the negatives and RNA intermediate and that listing in red we see for Idea one,

99
00:10:12,850 --> 00:10:17,080
which is a marker in macrophages that was meant to detect any cells present in the lab and appropriate.

100
00:10:17,650 --> 00:10:24,160
And we stand beside a curtain and sign here and that was meant to detect any epithelial cells so we

101
00:10:24,370 --> 00:10:29,590
call localization of any two signals was meant to tell us where active replication was occurring.

102
00:10:30,070 --> 00:10:36,910
So similar to what we saw in Fig. one, you see positive signs are scattered throughout the urine and the women of propria

103
00:10:37,690 --> 00:10:43,820
with certain cells really showing an aggregation of positive sense RNA using vaccine.

104
00:10:44,520 --> 00:10:46,570
Um, but the danger, as you see,

105
00:10:46,660 --> 00:10:54,730
the negative sense RNA signal was a lot smaller but was mainly associated here with the same answer for site of keratin.

106
00:10:54,760 --> 00:11:01,090
So that was really telling us that active replication was occurring mainly in epithelial cells.

107
00:11:02,290 --> 00:11:08,920
So we wanted to investigate the relationship between Vpu one and viral RNA for further imaging.

108
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:22,210
So we saw a high CO localization of between one and positive, since RNA can see over here the high concentration of green and red together.

109
00:11:22,990 --> 00:11:26,950
So we saw a high proliferation in many epithelial cells.

110
00:11:28,090 --> 00:11:36,040
The negative sense RNA, we saw a smaller signal overall, but we only saw a CO localization in certain epithelial cells and not all.

111
00:11:36,370 --> 00:11:43,450
So that was suggesting to us that active replication was really occurring in a subset of epithelial cells, not throughout the epithelium.

112
00:11:45,670 --> 00:11:49,690
So we wanted to investigate what subset is being infected.

113
00:11:50,230 --> 00:11:55,420
We directed antibodies against no markers for various specialized epithelial cells.

114
00:11:56,350 --> 00:12:05,800
We didn't antibodies against glycoprotein two for myself, combing a field transferase for top cells and Cro-Magnon and for intra endocrine cells.

115
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:10,270
Now recall that in the Merian model we saw tuft cells were the ones mainly being infected,

116
00:12:10,750 --> 00:12:19,140
but here we mainly saw a co association of negative sense RNA with CGA, which is the marker for enter endurance.

117
00:12:19,320 --> 00:12:23,170
So that was suggesting a completely different tropism than that of the murine or virus.

118
00:12:24,070 --> 00:12:29,000
You can see on the top here, I think this merge image really does a good job of breaking it down.

119
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:35,150
We can see the negative since RNA is localizing with the same BP one and greenfield.

120
00:12:35,800 --> 00:12:43,270
The localization of that together is suggesting that these are the sites of active or virus replication.

121
00:12:45,720 --> 00:12:52,950
Now, the mirror model also told us that nearly norovirus was replicating in myeloid and lymphoid immune cells.

122
00:12:53,490 --> 00:12:59,820
We wanted to see if that was true in humans as well. So what we saw, we directed we did some dating again,

123
00:13:00,120 --> 00:13:06,090
this time with this sign and became you antigen identified as a marker on both dendritic cells and macrophages.

124
00:13:06,780 --> 00:13:14,399
And again, with idea one, which is a marker for macrophages. Now DC sign, if you want to see a really high composition image,

125
00:13:14,400 --> 00:13:25,740
a there and an image B and C kind of an abbreviation of pink near the top there against the BP one positive norovirus, the epithelium.

126
00:13:26,490 --> 00:13:33,360
And in C and D, there's a really similar polarization of macrophages with the BP one antigen.

127
00:13:33,990 --> 00:13:38,610
Something really cool here. You can see in the blood, there is plenty there at the top left or top right.

128
00:13:39,300 --> 00:13:42,930
You can see dendrite sticking into the abdominal cell there. Really cool.

129
00:13:44,280 --> 00:13:51,690
But the composition isn't really telling us much as you just mean that that's only doing their job, you know, as macrophages their scavenger cells.

130
00:13:52,290 --> 00:13:57,360
So we wanted to see if active replication was occurring and that's what Ian F was really trying to study here.

131
00:13:58,560 --> 00:14:01,710
But unfortunately, we got almost a complete loss of signal.

132
00:14:01,740 --> 00:14:05,160
You can see the red is really, really small, as is that one dot there.

133
00:14:05,670 --> 00:14:13,229
And although we could detect it in macrophages and it was only the epithelium because the signal was so,

134
00:14:13,230 --> 00:14:17,580
so small, we really couldn't tell if active replication was occurring in the macrophages or not.

135
00:14:17,640 --> 00:14:25,590
So kind of disappointing, but we also wanted to see if noroviruses infecting lymphoid cells BMT.

136
00:14:25,590 --> 00:14:35,610
So, so in A.C. here we were trying to see if there was any overlap at all between norovirus virus RNA and some 20 marker on B cells and CD3,

137
00:14:35,610 --> 00:14:43,260
which is a marker on T cells that you see that in A the presence art is really towards the top there,

138
00:14:43,710 --> 00:14:47,220
but CV 20 and C three is kind of diffused throughout the Gulf.

139
00:14:47,220 --> 00:14:50,520
So there wasn't really a clear co localization,

140
00:14:50,520 --> 00:15:00,030
clear overlap in these signals and there was just investigating if there was a overlap between BP one antigen and markers of various T,

141
00:15:00,180 --> 00:15:05,850
so C, three, C, four and C, one, two, three, which is on intraepithelial lymphocytes.

142
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:11,340
And you can see there's kind of a little bit of overlap there between the brown pink.

143
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:19,860
But in G where we were trying to determine if active replication was occurring might be kind of hard to see.

144
00:15:19,860 --> 00:15:24,570
But over on the left there, there's a white piece that's there negative stranded RNA.

145
00:15:25,530 --> 00:15:33,270
And we measured the CTE 20, which is in green and C three in pink, and there really wasn't any overlap in signals there.

146
00:15:33,570 --> 00:15:38,100
So that was telling us that there was no active replication occurring in lymphocytes.

147
00:15:39,990 --> 00:15:44,280
Now, what does this mean? So our implications, the results.

148
00:15:44,310 --> 00:15:50,670
We see two really important things. The Mirror Norovirus model does not reflect the replication of a human or virus or the tropism.

149
00:15:51,210 --> 00:15:57,360
And we also identified intra endocrine cells as areas of active virus replication and

150
00:15:57,750 --> 00:16:03,209
intra endocrine cells are they have a really big role in nutrient sensing and absorption.

151
00:16:03,210 --> 00:16:07,590
So directly tied to the vagus nerve gut brain axis, which is really important.

152
00:16:08,100 --> 00:16:12,990
And they also have a role in supplying cytokines and hormones to the immune system.

153
00:16:13,350 --> 00:16:20,100
Now identifying enter and open cells as the sites of active more virus replication is really important because

154
00:16:20,100 --> 00:16:25,230
it helps us identify targets for future vaccine research and how we can treat norovirus in the future.

155
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:32,580
Now, our study had several limitations. We do recognize there are some issues with generalizability of our results.

156
00:16:33,480 --> 00:16:38,639
We use biopsies from G 2.4 infected patients. Now, this is only one strain of norovirus.

157
00:16:38,640 --> 00:16:42,180
While it is the main one that's affecting humans, there are also other ones out there.

158
00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:46,470
So further research is needed for other strains to see if these results apply to those as well.

159
00:16:46,920 --> 00:16:51,090
And we just had a generally small sample size, so these experiments would need to be repeated,

160
00:16:51,240 --> 00:16:59,520
replicated multiple times in order for us to determine for certain that these results that we saw are applicable to all viruses of the same strain.

161
00:17:00,690 --> 00:17:07,259
And again, we couldn't adequately visualize negative sense RNA presence in macrophages and potentially be due to an error in our assay.

162
00:17:07,260 --> 00:17:14,490
Potentially, the negative RNA was not amplified enough to detect this presence, but in any case, active replication could happen.

163
00:17:14,500 --> 00:17:21,360
Confirms that is an issue with our study. We weren't definitively able to conclude some really nice things though.

164
00:17:21,360 --> 00:17:26,009
We saw active replication in the epithelial layer of the small intestine as opposed to the colon.

165
00:17:26,010 --> 00:17:31,589
During acute infection, we demonstrated a localized presence of VPI one antigen and negative.

166
00:17:31,590 --> 00:17:37,290
Since RNA is in enter endocrine cells, which links these cells as the sites of active more virus replication.

167
00:17:37,920 --> 00:17:44,200
And we determined no active replication in the T lymphocytes, which differs from that of the murine norovirus model.

168
00:17:47,100 --> 00:17:51,480
So for future studies, definitely research is needed for other strains of newer virus.

169
00:17:51,510 --> 00:17:56,820
Again, our study only looked at JE 2.4, so different strains need to be investigated further.

170
00:17:57,690 --> 00:18:03,180
Further studies are needed on the role of intra endocrine cells in both immuno combatant and immunocompromised hosts,

171
00:18:03,270 --> 00:18:07,620
potentially seeing if they have any effect on the chronic symptoms that we're seeing.

172
00:18:08,700 --> 00:18:12,029
We need to confirm whether active replication really does occur in macrophages.

173
00:18:12,030 --> 00:18:19,890
Again, not really seen in our study. We do need to determine if gut homeostasis is affected in any way by the presence of high numbers of attacks.

174
00:18:19,920 --> 00:18:27,309
Now, I don't know if you recall a few slides ago, we saw really, really deep staining of tissue and potentially homeostasis could be affected by

175
00:18:27,310 --> 00:18:31,210
high presence of immune cells potentially impacting the outcome for patients.

176
00:18:31,230 --> 00:18:33,510
That's a really important thing to investigate.

177
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:42,030
And really most importantly, the inclusion of intra endocrine cells updates in cell cultures is it's indispensable knowledge for vaccine research,

178
00:18:42,030 --> 00:18:46,920
really, because as I mentioned in the beginning, norovirus doesn't really have any good cell culture.

179
00:18:46,930 --> 00:18:53,880
So this is really a big step to take for vaccine research, figuring out how we can treat norovirus in the future.

180
00:18:55,980 --> 00:19:06,570
And with that, are there any questions? Yeah.

181
00:19:06,580 --> 00:19:10,380
I guess I'm just wondering why you only collected samples.

182
00:19:11,700 --> 00:19:16,100
Right. It was. From what I understand, it was mainly a thing of convenience.

183
00:19:16,110 --> 00:19:18,240
I know some of these individuals,

184
00:19:18,570 --> 00:19:26,850
some of my colleagues in the study were very closely tied with the hospital in which this patient was were when these patients were admitted.

185
00:19:26,850 --> 00:19:33,059
So I believe it was just a convenience thing, but certainly more more a higher sample sizes definitely needed for the feature.

186
00:19:33,060 --> 00:19:45,880
Yeah. So as you mentioned, there's no virus for norovirus over the magazine writer.

187
00:19:46,870 --> 00:19:52,480
But there are a lot of efforts to make that experience based on what you've learned.

188
00:19:52,600 --> 00:19:56,980
What kind of delivery, vaccine delivery challenges you see?

189
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:01,270
I mean, delivery in terms of like have or, you know, mode of administration of the vaccine.

190
00:20:01,270 --> 00:20:08,499
Right. It would certainly be difficult to administrative vaccine, just like, first of all, orally,

191
00:20:08,500 --> 00:20:12,660
nothing would work because this is in the colon, obviously, the small intestine, definitely liver.

192
00:20:13,980 --> 00:20:22,390
Um, yeah, it would be very difficult to find something through the bloodstream.

193
00:20:23,350 --> 00:20:26,390
I'd be happy to talk through more options with you after it.

194
00:20:26,410 --> 00:20:33,850
But yeah, there definitely some issues. I mean, it's eligible, but so the challenge of the world when you need it to make it to that.

195
00:20:34,060 --> 00:20:38,170
Right, right, right. You just need to make it to a site that is then going to produce.

196
00:20:38,170 --> 00:20:40,630
Antibodies are going to be present, maybe closer. Mm hmm.

197
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:48,520
The other thing to think about is mucosal antibodies become much more important than serum antibodies in these types of.

198
00:20:48,520 --> 00:20:54,330
Like, if you've got mucosal replication happening, it doesn't matter if the antibodies are in the blood, if they're not making it to that.

199
00:20:54,460 --> 00:20:57,790
So like it starts becoming more important. Yeah.

200
00:20:59,380 --> 00:21:05,440
So that was a self-serving question because we're advertising for polio vaccine, the ban and the day.

201
00:21:08,650 --> 00:21:16,290
Thank you very much. All right, next speaker, your slides are in the other tabs.

202
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:38,290
Yeah. Hey, you know, just put this on because they're the ones that have gotten their presentation grades so far.

203
00:21:38,290 --> 00:21:46,910
I found that I'm a very hard grader, so. Okay.

204
00:21:50,000 --> 00:22:04,130
Well, that's scary. I think it is going to bring in 2016.

205
00:22:05,170 --> 00:22:08,290
You have to spend about seven to make it.

206
00:22:11,560 --> 00:22:14,680
Oh, wow. You have. That is ridiculous.

207
00:22:14,710 --> 00:22:18,800
How are you all feel? Okay.

208
00:22:20,630 --> 00:22:26,530
Well, thank you for making it to the set. Oh, right.

209
00:22:26,830 --> 00:22:31,300
Sorry to do things after that stuff in our symposium today.

210
00:22:31,810 --> 00:22:38,590
All right. Hi, everyone. I'm Alana and I will be presenting on behalf of all my colleagues on a Zika virus mutation that we

211
00:22:38,590 --> 00:22:44,560
identified which enhanced transmission potential and confirmed escape from protected dengue virus immunity.

212
00:22:47,470 --> 00:22:52,690
So for introduction, Zika and dengue viruses are part of the flavor of your day family,

213
00:22:52,690 --> 00:22:57,070
and this includes West Nile virus, yellow fever and Japanese encephalitis virus.

214
00:22:57,550 --> 00:23:02,980
And they are positive, single stranded RNA. So this is part of the class or Baltimore classification.

215
00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:12,880
The structure includes an icosahedron capsid, protein surface, dimer and envelope, which are the yellow things on there, and a lipid bilayer.

216
00:23:13,270 --> 00:23:19,060
So the primary vectors for flaviviruses are the mosquitoes in the bay.

217
00:23:19,330 --> 00:23:22,120
So Zika virus and dengue can be vertically transmitted.

218
00:23:22,120 --> 00:23:28,359
So from mother to offspring and for horizontal transmission, this can only be done for Zika virus.

219
00:23:28,360 --> 00:23:33,429
So this would be through sexual intercourse and Zika and dengue all circulate in many countries.

220
00:23:33,430 --> 00:23:39,700
And this actually poses a challenge to health care providers in diagnosing and distinguishing between the two infections.

221
00:23:43,780 --> 00:23:50,080
For background. Zika was first isolated in 1947 and the Zika virus in Uganda.

222
00:23:50,830 --> 00:23:55,300
It wasn't until 2015 where researchers really started to look into Zika.

223
00:23:55,330 --> 00:23:59,440
It wasn't a virus of interest until 2015.

224
00:23:59,440 --> 00:24:06,280
So we have a lot more to go off of now for Zika infected adults.

225
00:24:06,580 --> 00:24:11,290
Mild symptoms would include fever, rash, headache, conjunctivitis and muscle pains.

226
00:24:11,560 --> 00:24:16,270
So you would normally see adults with mild symptoms or just asymptomatic.

227
00:24:17,040 --> 00:24:27,160
And for from the 2015 emergence, we learned that mothers would be would have mild symptoms, but their offspring would not.

228
00:24:27,610 --> 00:24:31,660
They would have placental dysfunction. And this would actually elicit severe fetal defects.

229
00:24:31,990 --> 00:24:35,920
So this would include microcephaly. Fetal growth restriction and stillbirths.

230
00:24:38,160 --> 00:24:41,550
So Zika and dengue do induce severe and life threatening conditions.

231
00:24:41,760 --> 00:24:46,680
For Zika, we would present or this would present as congenital Zika syndrome, Guillain-Barré syndrome.

232
00:24:46,950 --> 00:24:50,430
And for dengue, we would usually see hemorrhagic fever and fatal shot.

233
00:24:51,810 --> 00:24:55,140
As of now, there is no cure or vaccine for Zika virus.

234
00:24:55,770 --> 00:25:00,750
Providers would treat symptoms so suggesting rest or providing fluids for the patients.

235
00:25:01,320 --> 00:25:04,410
And there is an approved vaccine for the dengue virus.

236
00:25:04,410 --> 00:25:09,480
But this is only for children's age nine through 16 and for those who live in endemic areas.

237
00:25:12,620 --> 00:25:20,990
So what we know so far, there are antigenic similarities between dengue and Zika virus and this is true for the other flaviviruses.

238
00:25:22,520 --> 00:25:26,840
But for the purposes of this presentation, I'll only be talking about Zika and dengue.

239
00:25:28,190 --> 00:25:33,110
And this leads to cross-reactive antibody mediated and t cell mediated immunity.

240
00:25:34,130 --> 00:25:38,660
There's also we also know that there's preexisting dengue immunity that sorry,

241
00:25:38,690 --> 00:25:42,530
that preexisting dengue and we really can cross protect against the Zika virus infection.

242
00:25:45,460 --> 00:25:52,990
We also know that we also believe that genetic changes enhancing Zika virus infection may have triggered the 2015 Brazil outbreak.

243
00:25:53,410 --> 00:26:00,460
And as we all know, RNA has a very high mutation frequency which would cause more virulent strain strains.

244
00:26:01,870 --> 00:26:08,290
And the objective of our study is to understand the mechanisms by which the pressures of preexisting immunity to dengue virus,

245
00:26:08,290 --> 00:26:13,630
an adaptation of mosquitoes or humans influence Zika virus, evolution, virulence and transmissibility.

246
00:26:17,090 --> 00:26:20,659
So for our methods, we wanted to mimic natural Zika virus evolution,

247
00:26:20,660 --> 00:26:27,940
and we did that by alternate packaging of wildtype Zika virus between cultured mosquito cells and either naive or dengue immune mice.

248
00:26:27,950 --> 00:26:32,569
And we did that for ten cycles, and after that we generated two new Zika strains.

249
00:26:32,570 --> 00:26:38,480
So I will be referring to a Z. And so these are from the naive mice and zida from the de gaming mice.

250
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:49,460
Next we sequence that there three strains. So the wild type and the two new strains and we found a 39 V mutation in a T for 70 mutation.

251
00:26:50,150 --> 00:26:58,640
And next we re we engineered allergenic genic recombinant viruses to determine which mutation or mutations was responsible for enhanced pathogenicity.

252
00:27:00,080 --> 00:27:06,850
And thus we made it female dengue in mice and allergenic sires, and we collected their fetuses placenta,

253
00:27:06,870 --> 00:27:11,120
the syndrome, maternal serum, brain and spleen to examine placental transmission.

254
00:27:13,040 --> 00:27:18,710
Then we infected human fetal neural progenitor cells with either nine mutation.

255
00:27:19,100 --> 00:27:24,230
And we did this to study the role of Zika virus mutation in the development of microcephaly.

256
00:27:26,060 --> 00:27:31,490
Next, we compare the honest to B protein sequences with 1058 Zika virus clinical isolates.

257
00:27:31,490 --> 00:27:38,000
And this is from the Viper database. And we wanted to determine the presence of mutation circulating among human populations.

258
00:27:38,870 --> 00:27:46,580
And lastly, we compared viral loads in age at time mosquitoes after infection to examine Zika virus infectivity in its natural vector.

259
00:27:51,030 --> 00:27:54,480
So this is just a list of the processes that we did for a study.

260
00:27:58,780 --> 00:28:05,890
For Fig. one from eight through C, we see that now you've mice were equally susceptible to infection among the three strains.

261
00:28:06,280 --> 00:28:15,130
And we see that in red, blue and green here. And this is consistent with our previous observations because these mice don't have preexisting immunity.

262
00:28:16,210 --> 00:28:24,760
However, from E3, gee, we did see that dengue came in mice with both the Z and and Z strains versus up to multi fatal infection.

263
00:28:25,060 --> 00:28:29,620
So by four days post-infection there's the strains in new severe disease.

264
00:28:29,980 --> 00:28:37,360
And by nine days post-infection the severe disease was 100% lethal for figures D and age.

265
00:28:37,360 --> 00:28:43,510
We just saw higher viral loads in both naive and dengue and immune Zika virus infected mice.

266
00:28:43,990 --> 00:28:51,370
So this would indicate that increased pathogenicity, a passage of Zika virus, was partly due to increase in viral replication.

267
00:28:55,360 --> 00:29:03,429
So the first figure at the top here is a Zika virus genome, and we detected two mutations which resulted in substitutions.

268
00:29:03,430 --> 00:29:11,900
So we saw an I 39 B mutation in the NEST hub location and a circle the wrong things.

269
00:29:12,310 --> 00:29:16,930
Here we saw at4 70 mutation in the location.

270
00:29:19,340 --> 00:29:21,950
And from either side, we just assess the survival,

271
00:29:21,950 --> 00:29:32,440
weight loss and clinical scores and found that the virus harboring the I3 nine we exhibited enhanced virulence in dengue in mice, but not 4470.

272
00:29:32,690 --> 00:29:43,160
So right here in 4470 erm we don't see such severe results and this is where both of the mutations are combined.

273
00:29:44,930 --> 00:29:49,009
So these results just indicate that the 3019 mutation alone was sufficient in

274
00:29:49,010 --> 00:29:54,080
enabling Zika virus to evade protection conferred by preexisting dengue immunity,

275
00:29:54,350 --> 00:29:57,950
whereas at4 79 mutation had no effect either alone or combined.

276
00:30:02,540 --> 00:30:05,990
Four. Figure three. This is where we wanted to examine placental transmission.

277
00:30:06,410 --> 00:30:14,810
So from either see most fetuses with or from the wild type, sorry, from the Zika virus, wild type infected dams are available.

278
00:30:15,050 --> 00:30:23,270
Only 3.5% were absorbed. And on the other hand, a vast majority of the 39 V infected dams were reserve.

279
00:30:23,270 --> 00:30:26,960
So 90%, 90% here with either mutation.

280
00:30:29,780 --> 00:30:35,300
For a figure we just saw the viral RNA levels were significantly higher in the placenta,

281
00:30:36,050 --> 00:30:45,020
deciduous serum brain and spleen in samples infected with oh 39 B compared to the wild type and 4eb found that levels

282
00:30:45,020 --> 00:30:52,140
of viral RNA and numbers of infectious Zika virus particles were significantly higher in NPCs infected with DI 1390.

283
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:59,000
And this would indicate that the I3 nine V mutation increases Zika replication are only in pregnant and non-pregnant mice,

284
00:30:59,330 --> 00:31:03,700
but also an imminent disease. All right.

285
00:31:03,700 --> 00:31:13,569
Last for you. So this is where we compared clinical Zika virus isolates in aligning the anatomy protein sequences with the isolates.

286
00:31:13,570 --> 00:31:18,670
We actually found two isolates that harbored the I 39 mutation and this is the I30 90.

287
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:22,060
And one of them was found in Japan and the other was in Indonesia.

288
00:31:22,270 --> 00:31:25,750
So in these figures we'll be looking at 39 T and 39 V.

289
00:31:27,550 --> 00:31:33,420
So from A through C, we saw that the 390 infected mice exhibited a transient increase in weight loss.

290
00:31:33,430 --> 00:31:37,870
So this is shown in the blue squares here in more severe sustained disease phenotype,

291
00:31:37,870 --> 00:31:46,030
but nonetheless are nevertheless all 39 t infected mice did survive, which shows that it's much milder in the I30 90.

292
00:31:46,360 --> 00:31:47,770
So right here in comparison.

293
00:31:50,090 --> 00:31:58,580
Do you just shows the process for our for comparing the viral loads of mosquitoes so we mixed sheep's blood with the three strains.

294
00:31:59,150 --> 00:32:07,070
We had the mosquitoes feed on it for 30 minutes and then we assessed the mosquitoes after eight days, usually using reverse transcriptase.

295
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:12,630
Q PCR. Sorry.

296
00:32:13,320 --> 00:32:23,140
For e genome we saw the genomic copies significantly increase in our 39 V and I 39 T strains and four f.

297
00:32:23,220 --> 00:32:30,390
We also saw that absolute viral burdens were significantly higher, nearly two fold for the two strains compared to the wild type.

298
00:32:31,350 --> 00:32:36,720
And these results would indicate that induced naturally occurring 39 mutations significantly

299
00:32:36,870 --> 00:32:41,520
significantly enhanced Zika virus fitness for transmission in its natural mosquito vector.

300
00:32:42,120 --> 00:32:47,910
And it also shows that pathogenicity increases in pregnant and non-pregnant mice, regardless of dengue immunity.

301
00:32:51,180 --> 00:32:56,909
In conclusion, our study describes a new approach to examining Zika virus evolution under various selective pressures.

302
00:32:56,910 --> 00:33:04,590
And we did this by simulating Zika virus, mosquito vertebrate transmission cycle in dengue naive and immune mice in immune settings.

303
00:33:05,220 --> 00:33:12,270
We also identified Zika virus mutation and in the end as to be a protein with profound effects on replication and pathogenicity.

304
00:33:13,680 --> 00:33:19,980
We also identified Ighv3 90 as the only three nine mutation among over 1000 clinical Zika virus isolates.

305
00:33:20,430 --> 00:33:26,100
And this mutation in particular has significantly increased infectivity in human fetal feces and mosquitoes,

306
00:33:26,370 --> 00:33:31,139
but modestly enhanced pathogenicity in mice. So we do believe that and as to the other three,

307
00:33:31,140 --> 00:33:34,950
nine mutations should be monitored as variants of interest because they have the

308
00:33:34,950 --> 00:33:40,530
potential to have potential for enhanced virulence and transmission in humans.

309
00:33:41,590 --> 00:33:48,870
And lastly, we believe our approach is valuable for early identification of Zika virus variants with greater infectivity and or virulence,

310
00:33:48,870 --> 00:33:53,430
and this would enable concerted deployment of public health programs to help avert an outbreak.

311
00:33:56,400 --> 00:34:01,709
Four Limitations are mice and cell lines did lack antiviral viral components.

312
00:34:01,710 --> 00:34:08,940
So this would be RNA interference and type one I of an earthquake and this would not accurately model the virus host interaction.

313
00:34:09,210 --> 00:34:14,310
So testing for pathogenicity in immuno competent mice and also other cell types would be useful here.

314
00:34:16,050 --> 00:34:20,310
And transmissibility of the mutant Zika virus strains in the mosquito host can only

315
00:34:20,310 --> 00:34:26,010
be investigated using mosquito mouse transmission models for future directions.

316
00:34:26,010 --> 00:34:31,650
We want to determine in which hosts and at which pathogen cycle the nest hub 39 new mutation emerged.

317
00:34:32,040 --> 00:34:36,990
And we also want to define the mechanism by which either mutation alters nest hub functions.

318
00:34:37,290 --> 00:34:43,260
We believe it is related to impacting the assembly of viral replication components, other functions.

319
00:34:43,680 --> 00:34:49,370
We would need to do further research on that to confirm. That's it.

320
00:34:49,490 --> 00:34:56,620
Any questions? Yes.

321
00:34:56,620 --> 00:35:00,520
Andrew. Question for you and your colleagues. I really thought for.

322
00:35:03,420 --> 00:35:09,480
Like the flaviviruses? That's a good question.

323
00:35:11,190 --> 00:35:16,349
We believe, yes, they do, because of the antigenic similarities between the flaviviruses.

324
00:35:16,350 --> 00:35:20,520
So there wouldn't be cross protection among the flaviviruses.

325
00:35:20,760 --> 00:35:29,370
So our approach would would I think would be useful for identifying Flavor Flav viral variants.

326
00:35:33,750 --> 00:35:41,730
I wonder if it would extend to other of the other nine. You guys are just sort of a general for general schema approach to go to other.

327
00:35:44,770 --> 00:35:47,860
Yeah. Yeah. We've moved to a different set of databases.

328
00:35:48,550 --> 00:35:53,500
That would be interesting to look at. Well, you answered the question that I had queued up,

329
00:35:54,100 --> 00:36:01,570
which was the the question of the question that would immediately come from the type of representation that a big conference would be.

330
00:36:02,350 --> 00:36:08,590
Okay. So you found this interesting mutation. Do you really think it has the fitness it really needs of the fitness to have sustained,

331
00:36:09,130 --> 00:36:13,750
not sustained human to human transmission, but sustained vector transmission in humans?

332
00:36:14,550 --> 00:36:25,330
Um, I can't say for sure now, so I think that's why it's important to monitor the mutation and we can decide from there to see if it would get worse.

333
00:36:25,810 --> 00:36:33,940
But we have to protect, never speculate on whether a virus is going to turn into a being a large spreading virus.

334
00:36:38,550 --> 00:36:46,500
I search. Thank you very much. The presentations have been excellent so far.

335
00:36:46,960 --> 00:36:58,690
Are they? Have you done this for other classes? Like have you done abstract presentations before so you needed this or is this this whole thing?

336
00:37:01,600 --> 00:37:07,250
But are very professional quality. So.

337
00:37:07,370 --> 00:37:19,830
Okay. All right, so now we're going to switch to the workshop.

338
00:37:21,574 --> 00:37:26,584
So for the last couple of minutes, I am doing an extremely fast introduction.

339
00:37:26,614 --> 00:37:33,244
So a key point in polio are the polio vaccine world that you're going to need to be able to do Monday's assignment.

340
00:37:33,814 --> 00:37:40,354
And I will either videotape Arbovirus lecture or we'll discuss it later that week.

341
00:37:43,484 --> 00:37:52,274
Because I'm not going to fit it in in the next 4 minutes. So. So in a global eradication effort of polio.

342
00:37:52,274 --> 00:38:00,374
So polio vaccines typically had they were trivalent, they covered polio types one, two and three.

343
00:38:01,004 --> 00:38:07,334
Now has a wild polio virus. Now, I'm speaking specifically about wild polio virus.

344
00:38:07,604 --> 00:38:12,904
You are SIMON on Monday is looking at vaccine derived polio virus which was sort of

345
00:38:12,914 --> 00:38:17,204
already talked about that concept because these are the oral vaccine is a live vaccine.

346
00:38:17,504 --> 00:38:23,234
You can have replication and reversion of the vaccine strain that then may be able to transmit,

347
00:38:23,384 --> 00:38:31,484
particularly when there's low population immunity in individual so but wild polio virus two naturally

348
00:38:31,484 --> 00:38:37,304
occurring polio virus and not linked to the vaccine had been considered by W.H.O. to be eradicated.

349
00:38:37,634 --> 00:38:41,293
And I don't know if you still go over this in infectious disease epidemiology,

350
00:38:41,294 --> 00:38:46,644
but the different levels that you can have something contained, eradicated, eliminating,

351
00:38:46,764 --> 00:38:54,253
you know control there's all these levels but had declared eradication and so what happened when that when

352
00:38:54,254 --> 00:39:00,823
these declarations happen what they basically do is they go through and they get rid of any stored strains,

353
00:39:00,824 --> 00:39:04,814
like they basically destroy all of the related viruses in labs.

354
00:39:05,264 --> 00:39:10,814
And as part of that, because the oral vaccine was a lot of vaccine,

355
00:39:11,054 --> 00:39:22,244
they actually had to the time they actually have to destroy the live vaccine product that contained that strain out of the worry that

356
00:39:22,244 --> 00:39:32,563
the that while that basically you could have exactly what's happening now you can have the reemergence of a vaccine type of polio,

357
00:39:32,564 --> 00:39:41,864
too. So there were all these like campaigns, like people dressed up like polio when they switched from the the product to the Bivalent product.

358
00:39:42,164 --> 00:39:45,254
The Bivalent product does not have a live product too.

359
00:39:45,524 --> 00:39:50,533
And then what they did is then caught them coordinated hit the goal was of the global

360
00:39:50,534 --> 00:39:56,444
campaign is then you then go to a coordinated switch to the inactivated virus as well.

361
00:39:56,834 --> 00:40:03,014
There's the link poster. Besides there's some links if you want to see these various things, this map right here,

362
00:40:03,014 --> 00:40:10,214
I highly encourage you click on it because they have little pictures of all of like the how the coordinated switch happened to different countries.

363
00:40:10,244 --> 00:40:19,783
I just love it. So there's this idea that the plan was to move the oral polio vaccine,

364
00:40:19,784 --> 00:40:27,164
the live vaccine to be bivalent and then gradually move everybody to the inactivated vaccine were vaccine derived.

365
00:40:27,164 --> 00:40:32,294
Polio virus infections is no longer possible. We have not done that switch yet.

366
00:40:32,624 --> 00:40:43,154
So because there have continued to be outbreaks of polio too, there was continued use of OPV to base vaccines.

367
00:40:43,154 --> 00:40:51,434
So there's, there's the MONOVALENT was sort of left in reserve for outbreak control that continued to be used.

368
00:40:51,434 --> 00:40:58,214
And so now kind of in a conundrum because that the plan didn't play out as as promised.

369
00:40:59,144 --> 00:41:06,674
Now there's some talk about offering a novel OPV to have a new Bivalent type two

370
00:41:06,674 --> 00:41:11,413
or an exact model of single strain type two oral vaccine to try to combat this.

371
00:41:11,414 --> 00:41:14,414
There's a lot of things you're going to see in the commentary for potential strategies.

372
00:41:15,014 --> 00:41:25,364
This was a problem mostly in countries that had OPV based vaccination programs, and I'll explain why that happens when I go over to polio lecture.

373
00:41:25,814 --> 00:41:34,723
But now what we're seeing is because we have emergence in countries with an IPV and inactivated polio virus or polio vaccine strategy.

374
00:41:34,724 --> 00:41:41,304
Now narrative a big problem. So that should give you least some basic and I've posted the slides if you need to refer back to that,

375
00:41:41,564 --> 00:41:45,104
but I can give you a little bit of a base understanding to approach Monday's workshop.

376
00:41:46,244 --> 00:41:50,614
Sorry. Well, thank you very much. Okay.

377
00:41:53,144 --> 00:41:53,474
Yeah.
