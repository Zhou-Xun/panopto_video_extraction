1
00:00:11,780 --> 00:00:15,080
All right. Welcome to High School Epidemiology two.

2
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:19,760
I'm Betsy Fasano and Dr. Stone.

3
00:00:20,450 --> 00:00:24,890
Hello. Hi, everyone. So, I.

4
00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:29,780
I hope you've all got an announcement for me about this new class.

5
00:00:31,310 --> 00:00:37,120
So if you haven't had a chance to peruse the canvas.

6
00:00:37,130 --> 00:00:41,560
Right, you're seeing it here. And then today, I'm just.

7
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:51,260
I hope you've had a chance to look at the preparation required reading and particularly watch the importance of hand hygiene,

8
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:54,080
because that's going to be very important for today.

9
00:00:55,670 --> 00:01:05,000
And I know some of you definitely started on the perusal, reflection and perusal when it's going to canvas.

10
00:01:06,650 --> 00:01:14,840
Every time you open perusal, it gives you a score, but you can keep on going back in until it closes to up your point.

11
00:01:14,850 --> 00:01:20,780
So, um, several people noted that to me and now I had them put a note on that.

12
00:01:20,780 --> 00:01:22,939
I don't know if you have peruse all that,

13
00:01:22,940 --> 00:01:33,710
but so do not panic if you open it up and start the assignment and you look and it shows on canvas that you've got zero or one at a total point.

14
00:01:34,100 --> 00:01:38,600
Okay, so there will be there.

15
00:01:38,710 --> 00:01:46,580
You'll see the upcoming assignments there. But I'm going to start here with the introductory slides which.

16
00:01:49,980 --> 00:01:57,910
So. Yeah, that's right.

17
00:01:59,220 --> 00:02:02,610
So you can see this. All this contact information.

18
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:07,649
I'm happy to talk to you anytime. Really? Just.

19
00:02:07,650 --> 00:02:10,800
You could. You can just send me an email.

20
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:20,069
Good morning. And, uh. Uh, or in a Google chat or something if you need something.

21
00:02:20,070 --> 00:02:20,880
Emergency.

22
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:29,370
But, you know, I know you're busy and I'm busy too, so I'll try to make sure and find a time to speak to you if you have questions about anything.

23
00:02:30,870 --> 00:02:39,719
Um, so I think it would be nice to introduce everybody to the class is supposed to be 24 people here.

24
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:45,120
Everybody shows up. I don't know how many people are back in the first day because they're taking a four day weekend.

25
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:51,510
But this is a really important class today because this class meets 3 hours on a Friday.

26
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:58,200
So we're going to pretend like it's two some days we'll pretend like it's two one and a half hour

27
00:02:58,200 --> 00:03:04,829
classes and other days we'll pretend it's like three one hour classes depending on how many lectures.

28
00:03:04,830 --> 00:03:10,890
So there will be a break no matter what in the morning.

29
00:03:10,950 --> 00:03:19,980
So I'll tell you a little bit about myself, and that's you five months I've been at the University of Michigan since 1984.

30
00:03:21,720 --> 00:03:26,530
My research focuses on molecular biology, infectious diseases.

31
00:03:26,550 --> 00:03:34,320
I've also worked quite a bit on antibiotic resistance, and I have a lot of research actually is in hospital acquired infections in that setting.

32
00:03:35,130 --> 00:03:42,750
And the founder, director of the CHIP program, which has now been running for 11 years, I said we're all familiar with it.

33
00:03:42,750 --> 00:03:45,960
I know Chip interns are here with us today.

34
00:03:47,460 --> 00:03:55,200
So in this class, I make no secret I have never been in infection.

35
00:03:55,200 --> 00:04:03,390
Prevention is okay, but this class is really taught by people who are infectious prevention.

36
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:10,139
It's if you look at the schedule, you will see that we have a series of presentations that are many,

37
00:04:10,140 --> 00:04:18,390
which are hands on interactive exercises to acquaint you of what it is like in the field to be an infection.

38
00:04:18,390 --> 00:04:22,500
Prevention is it's more a very applied kind of class.

39
00:04:22,860 --> 00:04:38,730
And we are assuming that, you know, the basic material that's in the hospital at the nurses taking in kind of hospital epidemiology one.

40
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:47,940
Okay. So what maybe just take a minute and briefly say your name and what you hope to take from the course.

41
00:04:48,780 --> 00:04:55,820
So, Nancy, is you you understand that everybody can see it.

42
00:05:02,690 --> 00:05:08,340
And that's the biggest question, I think, given ships, I should say.

43
00:05:08,900 --> 00:05:14,480
So, yeah, you can say. Sure. Hi, I'm Sarah Gardner.

44
00:05:14,510 --> 00:05:15,950
I'm a seven year itch to me,

45
00:05:15,950 --> 00:05:23,510
and I'm taking this class for the trip certificate and also to see if maybe a sexual attraction would be the career that I'd want to explore.

46
00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:35,950
Hi, I'm Brianna. I am hoping to get some more info on infection prevention in this class.

47
00:05:37,540 --> 00:05:42,040
Hi, I'm Trends. I'm a second year HIV student as well and I'm also kind of the same.

48
00:05:42,040 --> 00:05:45,700
And it's one of, like, more about AP. Um, hi. I'm Emily.

49
00:05:45,730 --> 00:05:52,690
I'm an HIV student. I'm doing this for the Czech certificate and because I would like to go into infection prevention as a career.

50
00:05:55,690 --> 00:06:05,800
Hi, I'm Chelsea. I'm also a second year Italy student and I am doing the Czech certificate and also interested in IP as a career after this.

51
00:06:07,480 --> 00:06:15,280
Hi, I'm Linda. I'm an M&A student and I'm of course, I want to learn more about public health and see the infection prevention career.

52
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:18,340
One of the possibilities so far, everyone.

53
00:06:18,370 --> 00:06:24,190
My name is Mary Elizabeth. I am from a community program.

54
00:06:24,220 --> 00:06:29,380
Second year I'm taking this course because I'm a conservative cert.

55
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:34,600
I also have a background in microbiology, so I'm very interested in these topics.

56
00:06:35,390 --> 00:06:39,610
Yeah. Hi. I'm Kate, her son.

57
00:06:39,640 --> 00:06:47,370
I'm doctoral student in environmental engineering. So I'm taking this class because of the deficit.

58
00:06:47,380 --> 00:06:53,170
And also to kind of give context to some of the things I'm researching and everything.

59
00:06:53,240 --> 00:07:05,250
Originally I was thinking here for my students and they've come together for the test and it was interesting and I'm proud that in fact justice is oh,

60
00:07:05,410 --> 00:07:09,400
I am. Helium also registered for this kind of change because of it.

61
00:07:09,430 --> 00:07:18,220
And also still finding a career or um, I mean are comfortable with all my future career.

62
00:07:19,330 --> 00:07:25,600
I'm Erin. I'm a general AP student also here for the certificate.

63
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:28,090
And just to learn more about infection prevention.

64
00:07:29,530 --> 00:07:37,120
Hi I'm Grace second year general AP student to finish of the job search in the field as well and then to.

65
00:07:37,620 --> 00:07:42,150
Sort of expand. Like infectious diseases.

66
00:07:45,030 --> 00:07:53,470
You. I'm in your general after school here. Also been associated with it and I want to be in 95 for graduation, so I'll be learning more skills.

67
00:07:54,900 --> 00:08:02,250
I'm Jordan. I'm a second year student, also doing the check certificate, which I decided to do because I'm hoping to pursue a career.

68
00:08:02,250 --> 00:08:15,960
And I think I'm really I'm also a second year student also and also trying to pursue a career in idea after graduation.

69
00:08:17,740 --> 00:08:23,330
Monica, I know that give you a general idea of the that it's no different.

70
00:08:23,620 --> 00:08:30,200
I wasn't really interested in infectious disease and. And what did I know?

71
00:08:32,850 --> 00:08:36,930
Hi. My name's Rusty. I'm Mr. Sun.

72
00:08:37,010 --> 00:08:42,350
And also. I'm not sure anything.

73
00:08:46,350 --> 00:08:54,990
I experienced that I'm a secondary the student. And I'm also curious about getting more involved in parks and recreation and career pursuits.

74
00:08:56,310 --> 00:09:01,500
I believe that in the nation you do that and I think it's significant in the career.

75
00:09:04,230 --> 00:09:16,560
Oh, great. Hi. Hi, everyone. I'm Emily Stillman, one of your instructors, and I am an infectious disease physician over at the medical school.

76
00:09:17,280 --> 00:09:21,900
And I also serve as one of our associate hospital epidemiologists.

77
00:09:21,950 --> 00:09:24,900
We work with all of our infection prevention as very closely.

78
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:31,160
And I'm also the medical director of occupational health services at the University of Michigan.

79
00:09:31,190 --> 00:09:38,280
So do a lot of employee health related work, which I'll talk to you guys about in more detail later in the semester.

80
00:09:38,970 --> 00:09:42,540
So that's me. Okay. So welcome, everyone.

81
00:09:43,530 --> 00:09:50,040
So here's the general objectives of this course is to understand the modes of transmission.

82
00:09:50,070 --> 00:09:55,139
I would just read it. Risk factors, appropriate interventions for prevention of healthcare,

83
00:09:55,140 --> 00:10:02,040
associated infections and knowledge and principles of effective hand hygiene, which is really critical.

84
00:10:02,790 --> 00:10:05,520
You will be doing hand hygiene surveys as part of this course.

85
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:12,279
Isolation systems, barrier control programs, and then knowledge of surveillance systems used in hospitals.

86
00:10:12,280 --> 00:10:15,690
And the ability to use surveillance definitions to identify HIV AIDS.

87
00:10:16,170 --> 00:10:22,020
So the two big pillars of this class are hand hygiene and surveillance.

88
00:10:23,890 --> 00:10:34,390
In. So you'll see it continues to analyze surveillance data, to develop rates, identify clusters and work through an outbreak investigation.

89
00:10:34,660 --> 00:10:39,400
If you do go into a career and IP, these are things you need to know how to do.

90
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:48,160
Understand the role of aseptic technique, cleaning, disinfection and sterilization, the ability to assess the adequacy of these procedures,

91
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:53,260
and then knowledge of how each area is present differently in specialized populations.

92
00:10:55,060 --> 00:11:04,690
So the course structure, there are in-class lectures, but a lot of it, as I mentioned, are going to be interactive tabletop exercises.

93
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:09,300
They'll be little ungraded quiz kind of questions.

94
00:11:10,660 --> 00:11:14,800
So the point is to be engaging and allow you to apply what you're learning.

95
00:11:14,920 --> 00:11:21,430
It's not a passive kind of thing. It also means that, though, that everything will be prerecorded.

96
00:11:21,430 --> 00:11:25,540
You will miss the opportunity to have that interaction if you don't come to class.

97
00:11:27,340 --> 00:11:38,110
There is required reading and that material will appear probably on the exams also and may or may not be touched on in class.

98
00:11:38,410 --> 00:11:41,950
There's a perusal reflections to help you think about that.

99
00:11:42,520 --> 00:11:49,540
So because there's these interactive exercises and discussions come prepared to discuss and participate,

100
00:11:50,290 --> 00:11:56,590
everybody will be happier and you'll learn more. So we will notice whether people show up or not.

101
00:11:58,180 --> 00:12:01,780
And participation. This is part of your grade.

102
00:12:03,550 --> 00:12:08,110
But you asking questions is the best way to engage with the material.

103
00:12:08,140 --> 00:12:16,000
There is no stupid question. So please ask questions so we can get beyond that.

104
00:12:17,590 --> 00:12:25,479
So we are still in the pandemic. And I can tell everybody here is thinking about infection control because there

105
00:12:25,480 --> 00:12:28,780
are lots of classrooms where you will walk in and no one is wearing a mask.

106
00:12:30,520 --> 00:12:35,420
But we wanted to limit its transmission as much as possible.

107
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:42,700
I don't know about you, but I've had lots of people who were very careful who suddenly got COVID in the last month.

108
00:12:44,200 --> 00:12:49,390
It's nothing that we ever want to have. I've already had it, but I really don't want to have it again.

109
00:12:50,200 --> 00:12:53,950
So I was not really sick at all. But I don't need the risk.

110
00:12:54,070 --> 00:12:57,070
So please limit eating drink in the room.

111
00:12:57,460 --> 00:13:04,500
Obviously distance is not really possible. And you know, if you don't want to wear a mask, that's fine.

112
00:13:04,510 --> 00:13:08,470
But, you know, we want everybody feel safe.

113
00:13:09,460 --> 00:13:13,240
And if you are sick, I don't care what you're sick with. Just don't come.

114
00:13:13,270 --> 00:13:16,270
It's all recorded. But please let me know.

115
00:13:16,450 --> 00:13:23,620
So I know that that's what you're doing. Okay? And we're assuming that you're all doing responsible, you know?

116
00:13:23,980 --> 00:13:31,270
I mean, there was a note I don't know if Friday morning is if they don't have anybody in there inspecting, but please,

117
00:13:31,910 --> 00:13:39,069
you know, if you if you feel responsible, please show up or if you're sick with something else, you never know.

118
00:13:39,070 --> 00:13:42,400
Right? Fine. Okay.

119
00:13:43,180 --> 00:13:53,290
So we are going to be flexible. I am really hoping that we're not going to have to pivot to a hybrid, but you never know.

120
00:13:53,290 --> 00:13:58,660
So we're all going to try to be flexible here. And the other thing is this things happen to everybody.

121
00:13:59,410 --> 00:14:03,880
So if something happens to you, it doesn't have to be a COVID related emergency.

122
00:14:04,420 --> 00:14:08,170
Please let me know and I can be helpful.

123
00:14:08,460 --> 00:14:14,320
All right? So I can be flexible with things, but if you don't tell me, I can't.

124
00:14:16,060 --> 00:14:19,330
So I promise you, I don't bite.

125
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:22,840
And I would be happy to help you if you need it. Okay. So please feel free.

126
00:14:22,870 --> 00:14:26,290
So if something happens, please reach out.

127
00:14:26,590 --> 00:14:29,110
And I ask also that we all be gentle with each other.

128
00:14:29,110 --> 00:14:35,560
And you can be gentle with me if like the computer blows up, which looks like they've settled that.

129
00:14:35,710 --> 00:14:42,670
But early on in my teaching when they first put on the computers, so I pre-dated computers in the building just so that,

130
00:14:42,670 --> 00:14:47,080
you know, they didn't used to have them, but they used to have cords on the floor.

131
00:14:47,410 --> 00:14:52,300
And I was doing the lecture and I tripped over the cords, unplugged everything, and we could not get it back up.

132
00:14:53,650 --> 00:15:01,820
It was so mortified. So anyway, we should all be handled with each other.

133
00:15:02,050 --> 00:15:05,500
There we go. So here's the contact information.

134
00:15:05,500 --> 00:15:12,820
It is on the website. You can find this. So here's the nitty gritty about how the courses.

135
00:15:13,180 --> 00:15:18,250
Yeah, attendance and participation will be 15% of the grade.

136
00:15:19,090 --> 00:15:22,360
And part of that is the comments on the readings or perusal.

137
00:15:23,590 --> 00:15:27,380
This is to encourage you. To actually engage with the reading eye.

138
00:15:27,400 --> 00:15:32,650
And I know it feels like you're spending 3 hours in class now.

139
00:15:32,650 --> 00:15:37,750
You're supposed to spend 2 hours of class where we are in class or 3 hours from graduate school.

140
00:15:37,750 --> 00:15:39,400
But I don't think anybody has that.

141
00:15:39,880 --> 00:15:49,300
But this is just encourage you to really take advantage of the material, the hand hygiene observations and report as 20% of the grade.

142
00:15:49,540 --> 00:15:53,230
In the second half of the morning. You're going to hear all about how that goes.

143
00:15:55,150 --> 00:16:00,670
There is a confidentiality statement that you need to complete and give to me by next Friday.

144
00:16:01,870 --> 00:16:21,069
There are you're going to be doing three hand hygiene observations in the hospital and then also a an initial report, which is due on 923 four.

145
00:16:21,070 --> 00:16:25,690
And it's basically a reflection about what your first experience was with hand hygiene observations.

146
00:16:26,110 --> 00:16:30,429
I know some of you have already done them. How many of you have already done hygiene observations?

147
00:16:30,430 --> 00:16:33,820
Right. So you guys can help the people who haven't.

148
00:16:33,910 --> 00:16:38,560
It's very nice to do it in pairs, especially as you must know when you've never done it.

149
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:46,809
It's kind of creepy. So I have done Hand Hygiene Series so I can speak to that.

150
00:16:46,810 --> 00:16:51,490
I know what it's like. It's, you know, that surveillance thing.

151
00:16:51,640 --> 00:16:56,230
All right. And then there is a final report. Do you can look all that up on there?

152
00:16:57,610 --> 00:17:06,630
This the final report is gives you an opportunity to give a report to write a report as you might as an IP to your manager.

153
00:17:07,210 --> 00:17:13,420
Right. And we'll talk more about as it come along, but that just gives you an idea what it looks like.

154
00:17:13,420 --> 00:17:16,510
And there are examples of what they might look like on it.

155
00:17:16,780 --> 00:17:20,880
She would shut that door. Okay.

156
00:17:20,890 --> 00:17:32,110
There's also a position paper. This position paper will be for you to an opportunity for you to read the infection control literature

157
00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:42,250
and write a paper as if like you were reporting to your manager about what they should do.

158
00:17:43,420 --> 00:17:46,180
There's also examples of these, but not on this topic.

159
00:17:46,780 --> 00:17:52,240
The topic this year is is there sufficient evidence to support universal masking in health care settings?

160
00:17:52,810 --> 00:18:02,050
Universal masking, meaning everybody who comes in and out of the building. So there are more details on that.

161
00:18:02,380 --> 00:18:03,970
We will certainly go over that later.

162
00:18:03,970 --> 00:18:11,830
But the idea is, is that you read the literature, you support your statements with the literature, you can go either way on it.

163
00:18:11,830 --> 00:18:17,500
You will not be graded on your answer. You will be graded on how well you make your argument.

164
00:18:22,850 --> 00:18:26,000
And November 18th will be here before we'll know it.

165
00:18:28,520 --> 00:18:33,880
There'll be three exams meant to exam midterm.

166
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:39,080
So I don't know how I got through Ed to a midterm and a final exam.

167
00:18:40,280 --> 00:18:50,090
And the format will be a combination of there will be like multiple choice questions and short essays which again ask you to engage with the material.

168
00:18:52,330 --> 00:19:00,760
So any questions on that part? It's all on the web.

169
00:19:01,810 --> 00:19:08,770
So though, there are more slides. The idea is this is a review.

170
00:19:08,900 --> 00:19:18,969
Okay. I'm not going to go over them, but you might want to go over them just to remind yourself about how things are in infection,

171
00:19:18,970 --> 00:19:22,380
what hospital epidemiology, infection control is, and so forth.

172
00:19:22,390 --> 00:19:28,660
So it's just a review and reminder that if you have any questions about them, you can let me know.

173
00:19:29,770 --> 00:19:34,600
So I'm going to close this in and then switch it over.

174
00:19:35,320 --> 00:19:44,550
I pushed on and is now going to talk. Okay.

175
00:19:44,560 --> 00:19:49,630
Well, good morning again, everyone. I already introduced myself, so I don't need to do that again.

176
00:19:51,220 --> 00:19:54,220
So we're fine.

177
00:19:54,880 --> 00:20:01,060
So I'm going to be talking about standard and transmission based precautions,

178
00:20:01,060 --> 00:20:08,080
as well as giving a little bit of background about hand hygiene before you learn about your hand hygiene observation project.

179
00:20:08,710 --> 00:20:15,640
A lot of this material should be kind of a review for you, especially those of you who took the previous hospital AP class.

180
00:20:15,670 --> 00:20:21,970
So I'm going to go through this pretty quickly. And if you have any questions afterward, just let me know.

181
00:20:23,650 --> 00:20:28,970
So again, we're going to talk about really the two different types of precautions that we use in health care.

182
00:20:28,990 --> 00:20:33,790
There are standard precautions which really apply to all patients.

183
00:20:34,120 --> 00:20:40,659
And then there are transmission based precautions which apply for specific types of infections based on the mode

184
00:20:40,660 --> 00:20:47,649
of transmission and the types of precautions that we'll talk about are airborne or respiratory precautions,

185
00:20:47,650 --> 00:20:51,400
droplet contact, protective precautions,

186
00:20:51,400 --> 00:20:58,810
which is a little bit different because that's actually designed more to protect the patient versus the health care worker and other patients.

187
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:06,220
And then one sort of new category of precautions that wasn't really touched on last year,

188
00:21:06,220 --> 00:21:09,790
but I kind of added in here is special pathogens precautions.

189
00:21:09,790 --> 00:21:16,030
And I bet you can probably guess what that's used for based on what's been going on the last couple of years.

190
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:21,979
So I'll go through all of these in detail. So standard precautions.

191
00:21:21,980 --> 00:21:27,700
So really the goal here is to summarize the major components of precautions that are used on all

192
00:21:27,700 --> 00:21:34,930
patients to prevent spread of pathogens between patients and from patients to health care personnel.

193
00:21:35,770 --> 00:21:43,720
So these are precautions that we use universally during all patient care situations,

194
00:21:44,560 --> 00:21:48,280
regardless of kind of what's going on with that individual patient.

195
00:21:50,440 --> 00:21:56,499
So our interpretation of standard precautions at Michigan Medicine is is here.

196
00:21:56,500 --> 00:22:00,610
And just, you know, standard precautions used to be called universal precautions.

197
00:22:00,610 --> 00:22:05,680
But at some point it got changed to standard. And I know exactly when that happened, but that's what we call it now.

198
00:22:06,220 --> 00:22:12,700
But basically, the kind of the tenets of standard precautions are we assume all patients are potentially infectious.

199
00:22:13,900 --> 00:22:19,690
That doesn't mean that we get, like creeped out by patients, that we don't provide appropriate care for them.

200
00:22:19,720 --> 00:22:26,140
It just means that we take common sense precautions to protect ourselves as well as other patients.

201
00:22:27,070 --> 00:22:32,530
We assume all body fluids are infectious. That's a pretty good, pretty good assumption to make.

202
00:22:33,520 --> 00:22:38,410
And we use the same precautions for body fluids regardless of patient diagnosis.

203
00:22:38,830 --> 00:22:46,000
So whether we know if a patient has HIV or some other illness, we're always going to take the same precautions regardless.

204
00:22:47,740 --> 00:22:54,050
And one of the biggest components of standard precautions is use of hand hygiene, which we'll talk more about later.

205
00:22:54,160 --> 00:22:59,470
That's really essential for both patient and our own safety to protect ourselves.

206
00:23:01,060 --> 00:23:04,720
So I'm just going to go through some of the different components of standard precautions.

207
00:23:06,190 --> 00:23:09,420
So first, I want to talk about gloves. And my question for you.

208
00:23:09,430 --> 00:23:14,220
Do we always wear gloves when we take care of patients? No.

209
00:23:14,290 --> 00:23:22,210
Right. There are times when you don't have to wear gloves. For example, if I'm just talking to a patient, taking a history, no gloves.

210
00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:29,980
If I'm examining a patient, an intact skin and not touching any mucous membranes or body fluids, I don't wear gloves.

211
00:23:30,490 --> 00:23:33,639
I wash my hands. So we don't always have to wear gloves.

212
00:23:33,640 --> 00:23:36,760
But there are situations where you may need to wear gloves.

213
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:42,339
So if you're going to have any contact with moist body, I should have taken moisture there.

214
00:23:42,340 --> 00:23:49,990
That word drives me nuts. With body, any body, substance, mucous membrane, or nonstick skin, you should wear gloves.

215
00:23:50,020 --> 00:23:58,660
That seems like pretty common sense, right? If you're performing vascular access procedures, putting in an I.V., for example, drying blood,

216
00:23:59,410 --> 00:24:08,980
handling any item or surface contaminated with body fluids, cleaning up blood or body fluids, spills or over abraded, cracked or not intact skin.

217
00:24:09,370 --> 00:24:15,850
So these are kind of common sense, right? If you're going to be touching anything that's kind of like icky, you should wear gloves, right?

218
00:24:18,560 --> 00:24:21,980
So this is an example of an appropriate indication for wearing gloves.

219
00:24:21,980 --> 00:24:26,990
So this individual is drawing blood. Here are some examples.

220
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:33,380
And these are these slides were taken from the predecessor who tried this course before I did for many years.

221
00:24:34,670 --> 00:24:40,520
But this is one of my my colleagues. Do you need to wear gloves when you're answering the phone in the hospital?

222
00:24:41,150 --> 00:24:44,460
No. Right. How about using your computer in the hospital?

223
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:51,799
No. And it actually drove me nuts, especially at the beginning of the pandemic, when I would see people at the grocery store wearing gloves.

224
00:24:51,800 --> 00:24:55,420
And I was just like, people, calm down. Just wash your hands.

225
00:24:55,450 --> 00:25:00,650
Right. So and I think people get a false sense of security from wearing gloves.

226
00:25:00,890 --> 00:25:06,049
And you don't realize that the gloves also get contaminated and then you contaminate your hands when you take off the gloves.

227
00:25:06,050 --> 00:25:13,820
So it's. Anyway, so there's a time and place for gloves, but kind of routine activities like this is not not the place for it.

228
00:25:14,780 --> 00:25:17,060
So the rules in terms of when you do wear gloves,

229
00:25:17,960 --> 00:25:23,470
obviously you're going to wear a new pair of gloves for each task on a single patient or between patients.

230
00:25:23,480 --> 00:25:31,040
So if you're in a patient's room and one minute you're drawing blood and the next minute you're doing something with the patient's urinary catheter,

231
00:25:31,040 --> 00:25:39,740
obviously you should change it to wash your hands, change your gloves in between those tests on different parts of the patient's body.

232
00:25:40,550 --> 00:25:47,000
Obviously, you should not reuse gloves. And then this is one of the things that that we struggle with is getting people to actually

233
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:50,270
wash their hands after they wear gloves because people don't realize they're like,

234
00:25:50,270 --> 00:25:55,250
oh, I wore gloves or my hands are clean, but you actually contaminate your hands a lot when you take the gloves off.

235
00:25:55,430 --> 00:25:58,880
So it's really important to perform hand hygiene after you take off gloves.

236
00:26:00,770 --> 00:26:12,710
All right. Face protection. So if there's any anticipated splashing to the eyes or other mucous membranes,

237
00:26:13,370 --> 00:26:20,150
you should wear face protection, including either a face shield or goggles, as well as a mask.

238
00:26:20,900 --> 00:26:24,680
Your own personal eyeglasses do not count as eye protection.

239
00:26:25,400 --> 00:26:27,680
If you want to use your own glasses as eye protection,

240
00:26:27,680 --> 00:26:34,520
it's recommended that you can get these little like side extenders that make you look really super cool that you can wear around the hospital.

241
00:26:35,840 --> 00:26:42,470
So this would be if you're doing any kind of patient care task where you might get splashed in the face.

242
00:26:43,010 --> 00:26:49,160
And this is probably the biggest kind of exposure we see in the hospital because people don't don't follow this.

243
00:26:50,060 --> 00:26:55,250
And then they wind up getting urine in their eye or blood in their eye or whatever it is.

244
00:26:56,600 --> 00:27:00,079
This is obviously gotten better with COVID because now we're wearing masks all the time.

245
00:27:00,080 --> 00:27:03,370
But the eye protection piece is still missing for a lot of people.

246
00:27:03,450 --> 00:27:07,330
So so that's face protection gowns.

247
00:27:08,600 --> 00:27:12,370
You should wear a fluid resistant gown if there's any splashing likely to occur.

248
00:27:12,380 --> 00:27:23,060
So if you like, if I'm in clinic, for example, and I am changing a dressing on kind of a nasty wound and there's like kind of icky stuff everywhere.

249
00:27:23,060 --> 00:27:26,020
Sometimes I'll wear a gown cause I don't want that stuff on my clothes. Basically.

250
00:27:26,180 --> 00:27:30,469
This is basically you wear a gown if you don't want your clothes to get icky is that is the

251
00:27:30,470 --> 00:27:38,060
rule and then shoe covers again like do I wear shoe covers 99% of the time in the hospital?

252
00:27:38,060 --> 00:27:45,680
No, I don't. But I did have when I was an intern, I did have a patient throw through a board on my shoes on Christmas.

253
00:27:45,680 --> 00:27:49,159
And that was that was very unpleasant.

254
00:27:49,160 --> 00:27:55,489
But for the most part, you wear shoe covers only if you're doing some kind of patient care task where

255
00:27:55,490 --> 00:27:58,070
there's going to be a lot of splashing and you don't want your shoes to get.

256
00:27:58,550 --> 00:28:02,300
GROSS But in general, we're not walking around the hospital with shoe covers on.

257
00:28:03,950 --> 00:28:07,220
All right. So that's standard precautions, pretty straightforward.

258
00:28:07,370 --> 00:28:10,040
We use them on all patients, regardless of diagnosis.

259
00:28:11,150 --> 00:28:18,170
And the thing about standard precautions is they require you to, like, think about stuff, which is where we get into trouble.

260
00:28:18,500 --> 00:28:24,380
You have to think like in advance, like, okay, I'm going into this patient's room and these are the tasks I need to be doing.

261
00:28:24,680 --> 00:28:29,240
So I should put on, you know, eye protection or I should put on a gown.

262
00:28:29,990 --> 00:28:35,930
And that's where things kind of fall apart because people don't really like necessarily think in advance about what they're going to be doing.

263
00:28:36,260 --> 00:28:39,890
And sometimes there are emergency situations where you're just running in the room,

264
00:28:40,640 --> 00:28:45,200
the patient's coding and you, you know, you don't have time to throw in all this garb.

265
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:52,790
So so that standard precautions, again, we're going to talk about hand hygiene later, but that's really an integral part of senior precautions.

266
00:28:53,390 --> 00:28:56,750
So any questions about that before I move on about standard precautions?

267
00:28:56,750 --> 00:29:02,360
And also, it's really just sort of common sense that you kind of use whatever tools you have in

268
00:29:02,360 --> 00:29:06,920
hand to protect yourself and protect other patients when you're providing patient care.

269
00:29:07,070 --> 00:29:12,650
So that makes sense, everyone. Okay. All right. So now we're going to get into transmission based precautions.

270
00:29:13,340 --> 00:29:17,360
And these are really precautions that we take to prevent spread of infection.

271
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:22,270
It's based on the mode of transmission of specific organisms.

272
00:29:22,930 --> 00:29:29,410
So these are the precautions we use when we have a patient who is known or suspected to have a specific type of infection.

273
00:29:30,070 --> 00:29:39,220
And we want to protect ourselves from getting that infection and we want to protect other patients in the hospital from getting that infection.

274
00:29:40,150 --> 00:29:45,100
So that's what transmission based precautions are. So these are really very situation specific.

275
00:29:45,340 --> 00:29:49,750
Not that we use these on all patients, but we use them in certain situations.

276
00:29:51,730 --> 00:29:56,990
So again, these are the different types of transmission based precautions will go through them each individually.

277
00:29:57,010 --> 00:30:04,180
So we'll start with respiratory airborne precautions. So so respiratory or airborne.

278
00:30:04,180 --> 00:30:08,620
And we tend to call that more airborne now. That's kind of the new the new term.

279
00:30:08,620 --> 00:30:11,920
And I don't I don't know why we switched over to use that, but.

280
00:30:12,490 --> 00:30:18,160
So airborne precautions are really used for diseases that are spread by droplet nuclei.

281
00:30:19,090 --> 00:30:22,720
And that includes tuberculosis, chickenpox, measles.

282
00:30:24,250 --> 00:30:30,730
So anyone know? What do I mean by droplet nuclei? Any idea what that means?

283
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:38,260
You know, the difference between development and error. So. Yeah.

284
00:30:38,710 --> 00:30:46,900
Droplets are bigger. And because of that, they don't travel as far as something like an aerosol.

285
00:30:47,320 --> 00:30:51,310
But there's the debate about like, is COVID more?

286
00:30:51,760 --> 00:30:55,210
Yeah, I think it's more droplet prevention.

287
00:30:56,110 --> 00:31:04,780
Yeah, it's so. So, yeah, exactly. And you know, I think the truth is that for for many decades in hospital epidemiology,

288
00:31:04,780 --> 00:31:08,950
we've had this paradigm where we call things either sort of droplet or airborne.

289
00:31:08,950 --> 00:31:11,110
But the truth is, it's more of a continuum. Right.

290
00:31:12,190 --> 00:31:18,420
And there sort of opportunistic aerosolization where, you know, certain procedures may result in aerosol formation.

291
00:31:18,820 --> 00:31:24,420
But the idea with with droplet nuclei versus actual respiratory droplets is that

292
00:31:24,640 --> 00:31:30,610
these droplet nuclei are very small and can travel much further through the air.

293
00:31:31,060 --> 00:31:37,090
So if I'm standing up here and we're all wearing masks right now, so this doesn't necessarily apply.

294
00:31:37,210 --> 00:31:47,080
But if I'm standing up here and I have tuberculosis and I'm coughing, I can infect any of the people in this room is the idea.

295
00:31:47,320 --> 00:31:53,380
So all you have to do to to get one of these diseases from someone is to be susceptible in sharing the same airspace.

296
00:31:54,580 --> 00:32:00,400
So they're much more contagious compared with the diseases we'll talk about with droplet precautions.

297
00:32:01,660 --> 00:32:07,240
So again, these are just some examples of the most common things that we see that are spread through kind of the airborne route.

298
00:32:08,140 --> 00:32:11,080
And these require use of airborne precautions rooms.

299
00:32:11,620 --> 00:32:21,069
So any time you have a patient who has confirmed or suspected tuberculosis, chickenpox, measles, we would put that patient.

300
00:32:21,070 --> 00:32:24,820
Obviously, we're going to put them in their own room. We don't want them in a room with another patient.

301
00:32:24,820 --> 00:32:32,139
Right. That would be bad. And typically, those rooms are going to be what we call negative pressure environments.

302
00:32:32,140 --> 00:32:36,910
Does anyone know what that mean means? What does it what do we mean by when we say negative pressure?

303
00:32:39,660 --> 00:32:45,480
And they should be okay.

304
00:32:46,140 --> 00:32:49,500
Yeah. And the room is lower than the rest of the building. So they're in the room?

305
00:32:49,560 --> 00:32:57,750
That's right, yeah. So it's basically the room that they air in the room as a as a negative pressure compared to the air outside the room.

306
00:32:58,110 --> 00:33:03,210
So when you open the door to the room, all the air gets sucked into the room as opposed to getting pushed out.

307
00:33:03,690 --> 00:33:10,590
And you can imagine why that's good, right? Because you don't want air from the room getting pushed down to the hallway every time you open the door.

308
00:33:11,070 --> 00:33:13,950
You know, if a patient is sitting in there with TB, that's bad.

309
00:33:15,090 --> 00:33:19,620
And then that air basically from the room gets exhausted directly into the outside world,

310
00:33:20,730 --> 00:33:27,720
you know, and into the Earth's atmosphere, which is very large. And so we don't worry about exhausting TB into the atmosphere.

311
00:33:27,840 --> 00:33:33,390
There's really not any risk associated with that. So that's what an airborne precautions room is.

312
00:33:33,690 --> 00:33:38,610
So if you walk around the hospital, you'll see certain rooms are designated as airborne precautions rooms,

313
00:33:39,990 --> 00:33:46,590
and usually on those rooms they'll have a monitor where you can monitor the air pressure to make sure that it's actually negative.

314
00:33:47,640 --> 00:33:50,160
You can actually use a simple test called the tissue test,

315
00:33:50,160 --> 00:33:55,980
where you put a piece of tissue by the door and see if it gets sucked in, which is kind of a low tech way.

316
00:33:57,060 --> 00:33:59,850
And then typically these rooms will also have an anti room,

317
00:34:00,150 --> 00:34:05,220
meaning they'll have like a little room that you go in to close the door before you go into the main patient room.

318
00:34:06,090 --> 00:34:13,080
Again, just to kind of separate the patient's air space from the the air airspace of the the hospital.

319
00:34:13,230 --> 00:34:17,370
So hopefully that makes sense to you. Okay.

320
00:34:18,480 --> 00:34:24,930
So when we take care of patients in airborne precautions, so, you know,

321
00:34:24,930 --> 00:34:32,930
for all patient care right now we're wearing pretty much these standard surgical masks and that's really to prevent sort of COVID transmission rate.

322
00:34:34,140 --> 00:34:40,830
But when we take care of patients who are in airborne precautions, we need to step up our level of risk for protection.

323
00:34:40,830 --> 00:34:44,070
And so typically 95 mask is recommended.

324
00:34:45,780 --> 00:34:55,680
So these are special OSHA approved masks that have a much higher level of filtration compared with kind of a standard surgical mask like I'm wearing.

325
00:34:56,400 --> 00:34:58,740
This is a picture of an N95 mask here.

326
00:34:58,920 --> 00:35:05,970
If you go around the hospital now, you'll see that the newer masks that most of us are wearing are kind of these like duckbill sheep,

327
00:35:06,930 --> 00:35:09,750
which basically do the same thing, but they're actually a lot more comfortable.

328
00:35:10,050 --> 00:35:13,600
And how many of the guys have worn and effective masks for a long period of time before?

329
00:35:13,620 --> 00:35:19,260
Is it comfy? No, it's it's horrible. Right. Like it's super tight and it feels like you can't breathe.

330
00:35:20,160 --> 00:35:22,710
So the newer masks are designed to be more comfortable.

331
00:35:24,150 --> 00:35:32,110
These masks do require that you get fit tested annually to make sure that there's a proper seal with your face.

332
00:35:32,680 --> 00:35:35,770
And how many of you guys have gone through the FIT testing process before?

333
00:35:35,790 --> 00:35:43,709
So a couple of you. So, you know, they put this like big kind of like hood over you and they pump some, like, saccharine spray in there.

334
00:35:43,710 --> 00:35:49,140
And you have to, like, do all these weird maneuvers and told if you can taste the the solution.

335
00:35:50,610 --> 00:35:56,310
And the reason that we do that is we want to make sure, well, first of all, we're required legally to do it by OSHA.

336
00:35:57,240 --> 00:36:03,719
And second of all, we want to make sure that the mask fits appropriately and is providing the correct level of protection.

337
00:36:03,720 --> 00:36:07,680
And so sometimes people one year they may, you know,

338
00:36:08,040 --> 00:36:13,830
wear a certain size mask and the next year maybe they lose weight or gain weight and they have to change their mask size.

339
00:36:13,840 --> 00:36:19,530
So there are some people who can't wear and 95 masks for various reasons.

340
00:36:19,950 --> 00:36:24,660
Probably the biggest one is people, anyone with facial hair, you can't you can't really wear one of these masks.

341
00:36:26,460 --> 00:36:30,080
So what are what are what's an alternative to an N95 mask?

342
00:36:30,090 --> 00:36:33,659
Does anyone know? Yeah. TAPPER Yeah.

343
00:36:33,660 --> 00:36:37,080
So a paper solar powered, air purifying respirator.

344
00:36:37,080 --> 00:36:41,670
So you'll see those are the things that look kind of like spacesuits the people wearing in the hospital.

345
00:36:41,680 --> 00:36:47,999
Sometimes it's basically like this big hood that you put over that has this, like, exhaust hose on it.

346
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:56,460
And it kind of serves the same purpose. And they are actually they're more comfortable to wear than the 95 mask.

347
00:36:57,480 --> 00:37:03,209
The issue with that is that they're kind of noisy and so it can be hard and like in

348
00:37:03,210 --> 00:37:07,080
our environment or something like that where you have to be able to communicate.

349
00:37:08,040 --> 00:37:13,590
But that's an alternative for people who can't wear an N95 mask so they can still provide care to these these patients.

350
00:37:15,450 --> 00:37:25,049
Okay. So this is the sign that we use for airborne precautions in our hospital, and it basically just tells you what to do, you know?

351
00:37:25,050 --> 00:37:27,120
So if you're a healthcare worker going up to this room,

352
00:37:27,990 --> 00:37:33,930
it'll basically give you instructions on what you need to do to enter this patient's room, which people appreciate.

353
00:37:33,930 --> 00:37:39,000
So, you know, keep the door closed, wear an 95 respirator or pepper.

354
00:37:39,840 --> 00:37:46,830
And the visitors are supposed to wear a mask. So they do tell pregnant women to check with the nurse before entering.

355
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:55,260
That's usually because if the patient, for example, has chicken pox, you wouldn't want a susceptible pregnant woman going into the room.

356
00:37:56,730 --> 00:38:01,230
So that's that's the reason that's there. So. All right.

357
00:38:01,230 --> 00:38:05,940
So any questions about airborne precautions at all? Okay.

358
00:38:05,940 --> 00:38:09,750
So droplet precautions. So these are diseases spread by large respiratory droplets.

359
00:38:10,350 --> 00:38:16,350
So these are droplets that really instead of traveling all the way to the back of the room, they only travel maybe like 4 to 6 feet.

360
00:38:18,090 --> 00:38:24,360
So examples of that would be most of the respiratory viruses like influenza, RSV, adenoviruses, etc.

361
00:38:25,110 --> 00:38:32,570
Also pertussis, which is a bacterial illness that causes whooping cough as well as meningococcal meningitis,

362
00:38:32,580 --> 00:38:35,640
is also spread through the the droplet route.

363
00:38:37,020 --> 00:38:46,889
So, so that's droplet. So for droplet precautions, again, typically we would have patients in a private room.

364
00:38:46,890 --> 00:38:52,950
Ideally, if you're experiencing, for example, if it's flu season and you have a surge of flu patients,

365
00:38:52,950 --> 00:38:59,070
you could potentially cohort two confirmed flu patients together if they have the same type of flu.

366
00:38:59,220 --> 00:39:03,510
You wouldn't want to put someone with flu and with flu B, for example.

367
00:39:04,440 --> 00:39:07,980
That's not something we do very often. But in theory, we could we could do that.

368
00:39:07,990 --> 00:39:17,090
We actually did that at the beginning of COVID. We cohorted people together in the same room for speak because we had space issues for this.

369
00:39:17,110 --> 00:39:26,880
You wear a mask and eye protection as well as gloves and then a gown for contact with a patient area.

370
00:39:29,700 --> 00:39:36,899
And the reason for wearing the it's obviously, obviously why you would wear the the mask and eye protection, right.

371
00:39:36,900 --> 00:39:44,310
Because you've got a patient who's, you know, coughing and they could get, you know, those respiratory droplets in your face.

372
00:39:45,810 --> 00:39:50,639
But the reason for the gloves and gown is because often with these patients as well,

373
00:39:50,640 --> 00:39:54,750
it's not just you don't just worry about the sort of the patient themselves,

374
00:39:54,750 --> 00:40:02,430
but also contamination of their surrounding environment, you know, and potentially these droplets can land on surfaces.

375
00:40:03,660 --> 00:40:09,180
And I think it's kind of debatable how much surface transmission actually contributes to spread of respiratory viruses.

376
00:40:09,180 --> 00:40:18,930
But there is this theoretical concern. So typically we also do gloves, gloves and a gown and of course, hand hygiene for droplet precautions.

377
00:40:20,730 --> 00:40:26,340
So this is our droplet precautions side. So again, it tells you what to do when you come in the room, wash your hands,

378
00:40:26,340 --> 00:40:31,470
wear a gown, gloves, face mask, eye protection, and then wash your hands when you leave.

379
00:40:32,100 --> 00:40:36,690
There is a little sort of sidebar there about patients with flu,

380
00:40:37,890 --> 00:40:48,010
because if you are doing certain types of procedures on a patient with flu, these are what we refer to as aerosol generating procedures.

381
00:40:48,090 --> 00:40:54,270
So again, flu is usually spread through the droplet route, but if you're doing certain things to the patient,

382
00:40:54,270 --> 00:40:59,670
you could potentially generate these respiratory aerosols that could increase the risk of transmission.

383
00:41:00,660 --> 00:41:05,380
And those would be things like if you're intubating the patient doing sputum induction,

384
00:41:05,400 --> 00:41:12,180
stuff like that, suctioning for that, it is recommended that you would wear an N95 or or pepper.

385
00:41:14,400 --> 00:41:20,340
So hopefully that makes sense to everyone. So any questions about droplet precautions at all?

386
00:41:21,750 --> 00:41:26,590
Again, I think this is a lot of this is kind of review for you guys. All right.

387
00:41:26,590 --> 00:41:28,090
So contact precautions.

388
00:41:28,540 --> 00:41:38,530
We used contact precautions for diseases that are likely to be carried from person to person on the hands or apparel of health care personnel.

389
00:41:39,460 --> 00:41:45,760
And this typically includes things like antibiotic resistant organisms, which you guys will learn about in more detail later in the semester.

390
00:41:46,540 --> 00:41:52,420
Like methicillin resistant staph aureus, vancomycin resistant enterococcus, etc.

391
00:41:53,350 --> 00:42:00,490
So when you have patients in the hospital who are infected with these organisms, typically you'll see that they are placing contact precautions.

392
00:42:01,480 --> 00:42:06,370
Again, that's to prevent me from going into patient A's room,

393
00:42:06,940 --> 00:42:13,809
providing care to that patient and then going to the next patient's room and bringing those nasty bacteria with me,

394
00:42:13,810 --> 00:42:21,760
either on my hands or on my clothing. Now, I'll explain the contact precautions in a second, and then, as gross as it is to think about,

395
00:42:21,760 --> 00:42:28,210
we also have patients with things like lice and scabies where we don't want to get that.

396
00:42:28,240 --> 00:42:32,200
First of all, we don't want to get it on us. Right? That's these are the things that.

397
00:42:32,440 --> 00:42:36,300
GROSS Our health care workers more than anything else, like bring on the COVID.

398
00:42:36,310 --> 00:42:40,900
But if someone has lice or scabies like that, is that is super gross.

399
00:42:42,370 --> 00:42:47,499
So license scabies are both ecto parasites that are transmitted by direct skin to skin contact.

400
00:42:47,500 --> 00:42:53,470
So you can see why if you're taking care of a patient with one of those conditions, you're going to want to be like covered up, right?

401
00:42:53,710 --> 00:42:58,630
You don't want to touch touch it. So what is contact precaution mean?

402
00:42:58,630 --> 00:43:03,640
It typically means patient will be in a private room and then the health care worker will

403
00:43:03,640 --> 00:43:12,690
wear a gown and gloves with especially with these multi-drug resistant organisms like MRSA.

404
00:43:12,700 --> 00:43:16,719
The E there's a lot of environment.

405
00:43:16,720 --> 00:43:20,680
So it's not just sort of the patient that's colonies colonized with these bacteria.

406
00:43:21,340 --> 00:43:25,390
There's also a lot of contamination of the patient's environment.

407
00:43:26,650 --> 00:43:37,750
So other objects within the patient room. And so for that reason, typically if you go in to see a patient who's in contact precautions,

408
00:43:38,380 --> 00:43:43,570
that patient will usually have kind of their own dedicated equipment that doesn't go between patients.

409
00:43:44,170 --> 00:43:47,020
For example, they'll usually have a stethoscope hanging in the room.

410
00:43:47,410 --> 00:43:53,710
So instead of me grabbing my stethoscope out of my pocket and listening to the patient and then putting it back in my pocket,

411
00:43:54,460 --> 00:43:58,840
I'm going to use the stethoscope that's in the room so I'm not contaminating my own stethoscope.

412
00:44:00,430 --> 00:44:07,180
And then any shared equipment that would be used on another patient has to be disinfected after it leaves the room.

413
00:44:07,930 --> 00:44:12,940
And we really try to avoid transferring these patients from place to place because there's a

414
00:44:12,940 --> 00:44:17,300
lot of logistical hassles with that and you got to kind of decontaminate the room afterward.

415
00:44:17,320 --> 00:44:22,630
So. So this is the sign that we use for contact precautions.

416
00:44:23,410 --> 00:44:27,459
So, again, hand hygiene gown and gloves. So this is again,

417
00:44:27,460 --> 00:44:34,390
is really just to keep as much of yourself covered as possible so that when you're coming in contact with that patient in their environment,

418
00:44:34,630 --> 00:44:39,070
you're not picking up whatever bugs. They literally bugs or, you know,

419
00:44:39,070 --> 00:44:47,380
figuratively like microbes that they have on them and bringing them along to the next patient or to yourself or your home.

420
00:44:49,310 --> 00:44:52,330
So that's kind of take precautions.

421
00:44:52,360 --> 00:44:55,389
Any questions about that? All right.

422
00:44:55,390 --> 00:44:58,270
We do sort of have a. Oh, sorry. Before I move on.

423
00:44:59,020 --> 00:45:09,080
So this is just a little slide showing sort of the the areas in a patient's room that are frequently contaminated with pathogens.

424
00:45:09,100 --> 00:45:15,220
And you can see there's all these kind of all these sort of green X's there,

425
00:45:15,940 --> 00:45:24,040
but it's really any high touch surface in the patient's room is going to frequently be contaminated with with pathogens.

426
00:45:25,090 --> 00:45:27,250
So what are some examples you guys can think of,

427
00:45:27,460 --> 00:45:33,610
of sort of high touch surfaces in a patient room that would, you'd be concerned, could get contaminated?

428
00:45:38,990 --> 00:45:42,020
Yeah. I'm really. Yeah.

429
00:45:42,950 --> 00:45:46,580
Um, I like that. Yeah. That the patients.

430
00:45:46,880 --> 00:45:47,959
Exactly. Yeah. Anything.

431
00:45:47,960 --> 00:45:55,520
The patient's touching that, like for button saying yeah, you know, remote control like anything the patient is touching a lot.

432
00:45:56,270 --> 00:46:04,340
Definitely the bathroom, the sink. So yeah, just sort of frequent high touch surfaces is what you're going to worry about.

433
00:46:04,910 --> 00:46:10,370
And I think the important thing is that when this patient ultimately is discharged or leave leaves this room,

434
00:46:10,370 --> 00:46:15,050
you need to focus on those areas in terms of your cleaning and we'll talk about that more later in the semester.

435
00:46:15,740 --> 00:46:21,860
Um, so there is sort of a like subcategory of contact precautions that we use at Michigan Medicine,

436
00:46:22,220 --> 00:46:26,240
which is contact precautions D and the D stands for diarrhea.

437
00:46:27,080 --> 00:46:28,630
We don't put that on the side.

438
00:46:28,640 --> 00:46:34,350
We don't you know, you don't want you don't want to be the patient like in the room that has the sign seeing diarrhea on it.

439
00:46:34,370 --> 00:46:45,109
Right. But that's basically what this means. And we use this for patients with diarrheal illness, including especially Clostridium aids.

440
00:46:45,110 --> 00:46:50,390
Now it's called difficile C for short in norovirus.

441
00:46:51,890 --> 00:47:01,820
And the reason for having this kind of separate category of contact precautions, really the only thing that's kind of different here is that when you.

442
00:47:01,880 --> 00:47:07,610
So everything else is the same, right? You go in the patient's room, you wash your hands first, put on your gown, put on your gloves.

443
00:47:09,110 --> 00:47:10,790
But when you leave the room,

444
00:47:12,920 --> 00:47:20,650
the there are special instructions telling you to use soap and water to wash your hands and not to use Purell or alcohol hand.

445
00:47:20,660 --> 00:47:26,180
Robin, why is that? Why do we not want to use hand sanitizer for these patients?

446
00:47:26,180 --> 00:47:29,209
Yeah, because this is for. Yeah.

447
00:47:29,210 --> 00:47:35,720
So see if the bacteria produces these spores that are not killed by the alcohol hand rub.

448
00:47:36,230 --> 00:47:43,460
So you really have to use soap and water and it's really the mechanical action of washing your hands to get those spores off.

449
00:47:44,330 --> 00:47:50,989
And then what about norovirus? So same thing.

450
00:47:50,990 --> 00:47:54,470
Norovirus is like not killed by anything. That's why it's so contagious.

451
00:47:55,160 --> 00:47:58,190
But basically, hand sanitizer does nothing for norovirus.

452
00:47:58,190 --> 00:48:04,999
So it's it's the soap and water, as is preferred in norovirus.

453
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:13,640
Both of these organisms heavily contaminate the patient environment, especially if the patient is having a lot of vomiting and diarrhea.

454
00:48:14,540 --> 00:48:23,570
And that's that's why these are so transmissible. So, yeah, so this is just sort of a subcategory of contact precautions.

455
00:48:23,780 --> 00:48:30,859
This is also a little bit of a code for our housekeeping staff to do some enhanced cleaning after the patient leaves the room.

456
00:48:30,860 --> 00:48:37,760
And we'll talk about that in a second. So the environmental implications here, especially for C diff,

457
00:48:38,330 --> 00:48:45,409
so the spores are not killed by disinfectants that we typically use for routine environmental cleaning in the hospital.

458
00:48:45,410 --> 00:48:50,720
So what do we use to kill to kill cities anywhere now?

459
00:48:50,780 --> 00:48:53,089
Yeah. Yes, we have to use bleach.

460
00:48:53,090 --> 00:48:59,630
So the regular cleaning solutions that we use don't really work against death again because they don't kill these spores.

461
00:49:00,590 --> 00:49:09,140
So you either have to use bleach. You could also use high concentrations of hydrogen peroxide is effective as well,

462
00:49:09,980 --> 00:49:13,280
which is sort of our regular cleaning agents to really work very well.

463
00:49:14,300 --> 00:49:18,140
And then again, all items between patients must be disinfected.

464
00:49:18,320 --> 00:49:24,889
So don't use your own stethoscope. And if there's a piece of equipment that has to be reused for another patient,

465
00:49:24,890 --> 00:49:31,310
you have to make sure that you clean it appropriately with with bleach or some other agent that kills seed of spores.

466
00:49:32,360 --> 00:49:36,830
The problem with bleach is that it is highly corrosive.

467
00:49:37,760 --> 00:49:41,870
And when you wipe stuff down with bleach a lot, it actually kind of destroys the equipment.

468
00:49:42,440 --> 00:49:47,479
So that's that's a big problem. So all right.

469
00:49:47,480 --> 00:49:51,559
So that's a little bit about the contact precautions.

470
00:49:51,560 --> 00:49:56,450
D So any questions about that at all?

471
00:49:57,740 --> 00:50:02,000
Okay. So next question is how long do patients stay in precautions?

472
00:50:03,440 --> 00:50:11,570
So for for kind of these antibiotic resistant organisms like the MRSA, it kind of depends.

473
00:50:13,160 --> 00:50:18,379
So for us, for some of these pathogens,

474
00:50:18,380 --> 00:50:24,230
we often will recommend some kind of follow up testing that's used to kind of clear the patient out of isolation.

475
00:50:24,950 --> 00:50:28,429
And I this is way beyond the scope of what you guys really need to know.

476
00:50:28,430 --> 00:50:38,270
But we do have policies in place. For example, if we have a patient who is known to be MRC positive, we do have ways of kind of.

477
00:50:38,360 --> 00:50:45,770
Clearing that patient out of isolation. We either negative cultures or, you know, other kind of other mechanisms to do that.

478
00:50:46,750 --> 00:50:56,190
But the truth is, once patients become sort of infected or colonized with these organisms, they can they can have harbor them for years, even so.

479
00:50:56,440 --> 00:50:59,320
So we do have policies in place to kind of deal with that.

480
00:51:00,010 --> 00:51:06,190
For Cardiff in particular, typically patients remain in precautions for the duration of their hospital stay.

481
00:51:07,180 --> 00:51:14,589
There isn't really any follow up testing that we do for that to show that the infection has cleared because the

482
00:51:14,590 --> 00:51:20,200
test can actually see positive for quite some time after even after the patient is sort of clinically recovered.

483
00:51:21,340 --> 00:51:28,540
So if usually people stay in precautions until they go home and then we make sure that their room gets all cleaned up appropriately, etc.

484
00:51:30,790 --> 00:51:40,710
All right. So protective precautions. This is really it's it's sort of in a separate category because this is really intended.

485
00:51:40,720 --> 00:51:50,470
So all the precautions we've talked about up till now are really designed more to protect, like us as health care workers as well as other patients.

486
00:51:50,800 --> 00:52:00,040
But protective precautions are really for this particular patient, and this is apply to patients who have some kind of immuno compromising condition.

487
00:52:00,730 --> 00:52:07,930
For example, maybe they have a leukemia and they're getting chemotherapy and they have no white blood cells in their entire body.

488
00:52:09,400 --> 00:52:16,090
And really what this means. So particular precautions really just means stop and do what you're actually supposed to do for this.

489
00:52:16,210 --> 00:52:25,390
I've seen just the other day I saw an intern, so I knew Dr. King come to a door of a patient in protective precautions.

490
00:52:25,390 --> 00:52:30,250
And he kind of looked at the sign. He's like, wait a second, this is all the stuff I'm supposed to do anyway.

491
00:52:30,250 --> 00:52:34,690
And I was like, Well, yes, exactly right. You're not supposed to go in the room if you're ill or you're supposed to wash your hands.

492
00:52:35,080 --> 00:52:42,819
It's really saying, like, hey, we really mean at this time, like, you know, because this patient has has no reserve.

493
00:52:42,820 --> 00:52:50,140
Right. So strict adherence to hand hygiene do not visit or care for patients if you're sick.

494
00:52:51,040 --> 00:52:54,850
No light plants in these rooms. Does anyone know why that might be?

495
00:52:55,510 --> 00:53:04,330
You here? I'm just finishing up. So why would we not want live plants in the room of a patient who's kind of severely immunocompromised?

496
00:53:05,890 --> 00:53:12,580
It's okay if you don't know about it. Yeah, we're going to bring in that with them.

497
00:53:13,090 --> 00:53:17,379
Yeah, exactly. So and it's actually it's a bacteria is, you know, one thing,

498
00:53:17,380 --> 00:53:23,650
but it's actually we worry more about like mold because these patients tend to be very susceptible to mold infections.

499
00:53:25,810 --> 00:53:31,090
And that's the whole separate topic that you guys will learn about later, later in the semester.

500
00:53:31,090 --> 00:53:36,490
But yes, you know, like plants. So no life, no pretty flower arrangements for these patients, unfortunately.

501
00:53:37,540 --> 00:53:40,390
And some of these patients require special air handling,

502
00:53:41,680 --> 00:53:47,860
which is either a positive pressure environment or they may have a HEPA filter in their room to filter the air.

503
00:53:48,190 --> 00:53:51,930
So positive pressure is the exact opposite of what we talked about before.

504
00:53:51,940 --> 00:53:56,440
Right. So we talk about negative pressure where the air gets sucked into the room.

505
00:53:56,450 --> 00:54:03,100
Positive means when you open the door to the room, air actually gets pushed out of the room into the hallway.

506
00:54:03,880 --> 00:54:08,880
And again, that's to protect the patient from any pathogens that could be circulating in the air.

507
00:54:08,890 --> 00:54:15,580
So hopefully that makes sense to you guys. So we do have some rooms that are under positive pressure, which is basically the opposite.

508
00:54:15,590 --> 00:54:21,640
So again, we're really trying to protect the patient here as opposed to the other types of precautions that we talked about.

509
00:54:23,290 --> 00:54:29,470
Okay. And finally, I want to talk just a little bit about special pathogens, precautions.

510
00:54:30,760 --> 00:54:34,150
So essentially special pathogens precaution.

511
00:54:34,180 --> 00:54:37,419
This is what we call it here at U of M if you go to other places,

512
00:54:37,420 --> 00:54:44,350
it might have a different name, but it's essentially a combination of airborne plus droplet.

513
00:54:45,310 --> 00:54:51,100
So in order to enter the patient's room, you're going to be wearing kind of a combination of all that gear, right?

514
00:54:51,190 --> 00:55:00,930
You're going to be wearing your eye protection. You're going to be wearing an N95 mask or a paper, and you're going to be wearing gown and gloves.

515
00:55:00,940 --> 00:55:08,610
So it's really a combination of everything you would wear for both airborne plus droplet, and this is really used for it.

516
00:55:08,650 --> 00:55:18,280
First of all, these are for COVID 19 because there is concern with COVID that there could be a little

517
00:55:18,280 --> 00:55:22,510
more opportunity for airborne transmission as compared with other respiratory viruses.

518
00:55:23,440 --> 00:55:28,210
We would also use this for other novel coronaviruses like SaaS and mirrors,

519
00:55:28,720 --> 00:55:33,310
things that we don't really worry too much about anymore novel influenza viruses.

520
00:55:33,310 --> 00:55:37,810
So if we have a flu pandemic where we don't really got a new.

521
00:55:37,910 --> 00:55:41,170
Flu virus. We don't really know very much yet about how it's transmitted.

522
00:55:41,180 --> 00:55:44,420
So this, for example, would have been the 2009 flu pandemic.

523
00:55:45,170 --> 00:55:53,450
We use special pathogens, precautions to take care of patients or really any other novel pathogens where they just haven't been studied very much yet.

524
00:55:53,450 --> 00:55:56,690
We don't really understand very well how they're transmitted.

525
00:55:56,780 --> 00:56:03,950
We're going to kind of use this. It's sort of a higher level of protection, right, compared with kind of our standard droplet precautions that we use.

526
00:56:04,100 --> 00:56:11,180
So hopefully that does that make sense to everyone. Okay. And that's the sign that you'll see when you go to the patient's room.

527
00:56:11,210 --> 00:56:18,320
So, again, transmission based precautions used for prevention of spread of specific microorganisms based on their type of transmission.

528
00:56:20,090 --> 00:56:26,479
And a reminder, of course, that these are always used in addition to standard precautions and hand hygiene.

529
00:56:26,480 --> 00:56:28,280
So we never forget about the basics.

530
00:56:28,940 --> 00:56:36,320
So this is just transmission based precautions are sort of like extra precautions that we take in addition to the usual stuff that we do.

531
00:56:38,090 --> 00:56:40,790
All right. So real quick, I'm just going to run through a couple of cases here.

532
00:56:41,660 --> 00:56:48,200
So case number one, you were called about a five year old patient in my hospital who's broken out with a chickenpox rash.

533
00:56:48,410 --> 00:56:52,290
So what should you do with this patient? Yeah.

534
00:56:52,380 --> 00:56:56,400
But in isolation. Yeah. So airborne precautions, right?

535
00:56:56,730 --> 00:57:01,920
So chicken pox spread through the airborne route. So we're going to put this kid an airborne precaution.

536
00:57:01,930 --> 00:57:05,920
So what does that mean? Negative pressure.

537
00:57:06,130 --> 00:57:10,120
Negative pressure room? Yep. What else?

538
00:57:13,420 --> 00:57:21,090
What am I going to wear when I go in the room? And then you divert effort.

539
00:57:21,360 --> 00:57:24,980
Yeah. So I'm going to wear some kind of respirator in 95. Mask or pepper?

540
00:57:25,100 --> 00:57:28,700
Yeah. So this is just airborne precautions? Yeah.

541
00:57:29,360 --> 00:57:33,019
75 year old man immigrated from Mexico two years ago.

542
00:57:33,020 --> 00:57:36,770
Has a prolonged cough, weight loss, cavity infiltrate and chest x ray.

543
00:57:37,440 --> 00:57:43,230
Okay, so what do we think this guy has? TB Yeah.

544
00:57:43,260 --> 00:57:49,320
So this is tuberculosis. Don't worry, if you didn't didn't figure that out from that one sentence.

545
00:57:49,380 --> 00:57:52,440
But so we were supposed to assume this guy had tuberculosis.

546
00:57:52,440 --> 00:58:00,329
How is tuberculosis transmitted? Not droplet airborne.

547
00:58:00,330 --> 00:58:03,540
Yeah. So are we to recommend the physician use isolation?

548
00:58:03,540 --> 00:58:08,130
Well, yes. What type of isolation is airborne?

549
00:58:08,160 --> 00:58:11,250
Okay. All right. All right.

550
00:58:11,250 --> 00:58:20,280
So the health department does follow up tuberculin skin testing on the family of patient number two and identifies several who have positive tests.

551
00:58:20,280 --> 00:58:21,719
So this is the patient's family.

552
00:58:21,720 --> 00:58:31,230
Presumably they live with him and they have been continuously exposed to him and they are now also testing positive for TB.

553
00:58:32,130 --> 00:58:35,520
Can they visit the patient so they have positive TB skin test?

554
00:58:35,530 --> 00:58:39,660
So can they visit the patient in the hospital? This is a kind of a trick question.

555
00:58:42,720 --> 00:58:47,460
So it's a maybe what else would you want to know about these individuals?

556
00:58:48,040 --> 00:58:51,269
But what's it up to? Yeah.

557
00:58:51,270 --> 00:58:54,420
Do they have do they have active tuberculosis? Right.

558
00:58:55,710 --> 00:58:59,100
So do they have symptoms concerning for active TB?

559
00:58:59,100 --> 00:59:02,460
And if the answer is yes, do we want them visiting the hospital?

560
00:59:03,150 --> 00:59:09,809
Absolutely right. We want them to stay home. But if they are asymptomatic and all they have is a positive skin test,

561
00:59:09,810 --> 00:59:13,560
meaning they've been exposed to this guy, but they're not they don't have active TB at the moment.

562
00:59:13,710 --> 00:59:21,420
They can come visit. They've already been exposed to the guy. So, you know, so it's a it's a little bit of a trick question here.

563
00:59:21,660 --> 00:59:25,470
So we're going to talk more about TB later in the semester. So don't worry if you don't get all that.

564
00:59:26,430 --> 00:59:31,410
All right. So a patient with a cough has nasal PCR test positive for pertussis.

565
00:59:32,010 --> 00:59:41,040
She's being admitted for a kidney infection. So kind of an unrelated reason she's still coughing, has not been treated or any precautions necessary.

566
00:59:41,040 --> 00:59:46,619
So this is a patient with pertussis, so probably precautions are necessary.

567
00:59:46,620 --> 00:59:50,040
How is pertussis spread through droplet?

568
00:59:50,040 --> 00:59:54,419
Right. So we're going to put the patient in droplet precautions.

569
00:59:54,420 --> 01:00:04,460
Which means what? Yeah, I heard.

570
01:00:04,670 --> 01:00:08,210
Sorry, sir. Herman, everyone is mad because I can't see who lives here.

571
01:00:08,780 --> 01:00:11,870
But I heard I production. What else in the world?

572
01:00:12,170 --> 01:00:15,230
Yeah. Gowns, gloves and a mask which were always wearing anyway. Yeah.

573
01:00:15,560 --> 01:00:20,570
So. Exactly. So droplet precautions. And the patient would be in a private room ideally as well.

574
01:00:20,570 --> 01:00:24,290
So they're not giving pertussis to other patients. All right.

575
01:00:25,100 --> 01:00:28,489
I kind of skip over this. This is the kind of the key points from today.

576
01:00:28,490 --> 01:00:33,080
But I think we're we're probably good. These are these are for my my predecessor who taught this course.

577
01:00:33,080 --> 01:00:39,379
The last one is my favorite hospital epidemiology is a fun and exciting career and you want to learn more.

578
01:00:39,380 --> 01:00:45,740
But obviously that is true for a lot of you. A lot of you are here because you're interested in a career in infection prevention.

579
01:00:47,420 --> 01:00:52,010
So I don't know if you want I don't hear this here. Should we just kind of watch the hand hygiene thing?

580
01:00:52,010 --> 01:00:57,900
This is what's in the they hope they were all assigned to watch that hand hygiene and they felt good.

581
01:00:58,070 --> 01:01:01,780
Okay. So we don't know that. Hopefully they all did. Okay.

582
01:01:02,360 --> 01:01:05,480
Okay. Well, all right. So do you think we can kind of skip over this?

583
01:01:05,540 --> 01:01:09,290
Yeah, this part, then? Do you want to take a break and then have Harry do his thing or.

584
01:01:09,320 --> 01:01:13,040
Yeah, we're going to give it a thematic break. A very good thing.

585
01:01:13,370 --> 01:01:23,030
Anyway, thank you. Yes. So you are all recommended to look at the slide, but these are these slides that after in video, I think.

586
01:01:23,180 --> 01:01:27,620
Oh, okay. Yeah. And I would summarize the slides that hand hygiene is important,

587
01:01:28,310 --> 01:01:33,890
but we as health care workers are bad at it and there are things we can do to get better.

588
01:01:34,490 --> 01:01:39,049
And that's that's basically that's basically the summary. So I think we'll take a break.

589
01:01:39,050 --> 01:01:48,530
For how long did you say, oh, well, if we don't want to keep carried ten, ten, maybe 10 minutes, we have to walk around.

590
01:01:49,790 --> 01:01:53,510
All right. That's perfect. Yeah. If you guys have any questions, we'll.

591
01:01:53,600 --> 01:01:56,900
We'll be up here. Are you all right? No, I'm good.

592
01:01:58,070 --> 01:02:12,490
Hi, Mary. Hey. Hey, mister.

593
01:02:14,570 --> 01:02:20,120
I forgot how long. I don't know. What's that? I almost forgot how long it takes to walk here now.

594
01:02:20,330 --> 01:02:24,480
I was like, Oh, I'll just leave, you know, 15 to be a little bit like.

595
01:02:25,020 --> 01:02:28,630
Like we can make you well, like there's a lot of good yeah.

596
01:02:28,640 --> 01:02:32,000
So yeah. But yeah, I know.

597
01:02:32,000 --> 01:02:35,330
I'm also heard over here. I didn't.

598
01:02:35,390 --> 01:02:41,340
I didn't, I don't know if you had a social work.

599
01:02:45,510 --> 01:02:54,240
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

600
01:02:55,000 --> 01:02:58,660
But I don't know.

601
01:03:02,470 --> 01:03:12,240
It comes quick, but for the most part, it's all about you.

602
01:03:14,770 --> 01:03:18,820
I heard it all before. Half an hour later when you were there.

603
01:03:19,510 --> 01:03:25,170
Yeah. Yeah. And I'm like, Oh, yeah, really?

604
01:03:26,500 --> 01:03:30,270
You know, like my family and that kind of stuff.

605
01:03:30,470 --> 01:03:35,290
A little thing, right? Well, you know what?

606
01:03:35,310 --> 01:03:46,060
Every bit more of that. Yeah. Can you imagine? Oh, yeah. You know, she's like some friends of mine that she just like.

607
01:03:46,350 --> 01:04:05,380
And they said, like, she works, but she to go in, which I was like, I don't think you uploaded pictures and they sent you that.

608
01:04:08,000 --> 01:04:15,010
That was really designed to live on for a while. And I didn't want to forget that I'm on camera here.

609
01:04:15,010 --> 01:04:28,810
It's not creepiness, you know what I mean?

610
01:04:29,390 --> 01:04:42,500
Oh, really? Yeah. I'm going to be only 24, and I hope I get it eventually.

611
01:04:42,520 --> 01:04:49,890
Where I can know. How you doing?

612
01:04:49,970 --> 01:04:53,160
Carry good solutions.

613
01:04:53,220 --> 01:04:57,750
I mean, you're serious. So life is going well?

614
01:04:59,850 --> 01:05:05,730
Yeah. Yeah. Oh, yeah.

615
01:05:05,970 --> 01:05:15,400
And then, you know, it's like trying to get, like, other places, you know, be able to start doing other things.

616
01:05:15,600 --> 01:05:19,530
Where are they trying to get to further away?

617
01:05:19,660 --> 01:05:24,560
Places that are trying to get the way. It is a great way to work.

618
01:05:24,660 --> 01:05:35,190
But yeah, it's kind of exhausting tonight. But I you know, this is by the way, you know, I think so.

619
01:05:35,580 --> 01:05:39,330
And usually I'm the one that fills out our rent check, antioxidants.

620
01:05:39,330 --> 01:05:42,890
But since I'm here, I like to be around.

621
01:05:42,990 --> 01:05:48,540
Well, he paid it, but I just got an email that said hi just for future notice when filling out a check.

622
01:05:48,540 --> 01:05:59,550
Please don't use pencil. Larry King Not everyone is.

623
01:05:59,580 --> 01:06:03,930
I think, you know, they don't have you do it online.

624
01:06:03,930 --> 01:06:06,990
They make you do here. You know, they make us take a physical.

625
01:06:07,800 --> 01:06:16,830
They're a little bit about annoying. Yeah. So there's like, oh, we don't have it like just like they have like, oh yeah, we live in a complex,

626
01:06:16,830 --> 01:06:22,950
it's like a house, so it's just like a small landlord that he does like six or seven people.

627
01:06:23,040 --> 01:06:38,840
So that makes it seem like it doesn't seem like maybe she like took it to the bank in the main or is like, we'll do it this time.

628
01:06:38,850 --> 01:06:51,050
It's like it's hard to, I don't know where I mean we can always find humor in the thing is like our checkbook so we don't have power

629
01:06:51,210 --> 01:07:00,360
but it's like sitting there probably in a drawer like in like a little thing by itself with a pen and like.

630
01:07:00,810 --> 01:07:04,530
So he went out of his way to find a pencil. We have three managers.

631
01:07:04,530 --> 01:07:12,669
There's obviously a matter of director to go to environmental health for their their focus is a little bit more on

632
01:07:12,670 --> 01:07:20,399
the environment aspect things so air quality water management for us or something new to specialized dedicated?

633
01:07:20,400 --> 01:07:23,640
I think so that will be a jack of all trades.

634
01:07:23,910 --> 01:07:34,240
Exactly. It's just too complicated. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

635
01:07:34,550 --> 01:07:40,580
I know. My father was like, Yeah, yeah.

636
01:07:40,580 --> 01:07:51,440
So we're working the way to the second part of the well, not the same thing.

637
01:07:52,440 --> 01:07:56,270
I was like, Oh, I think, Oh yeah.

638
01:07:57,870 --> 01:08:10,710
It's just, you know, the drill down to, to structure was cool.

639
01:08:10,980 --> 01:08:15,299
I'm just writing down, which is out.

640
01:08:15,300 --> 01:08:21,510
But anyway she said, yeah, yeah, yeah.

641
01:08:21,510 --> 01:08:26,050
Oh really. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

642
01:08:26,250 --> 01:08:32,370
Oh yeah. Like something told me the only one that was prepared to be a loved one.

643
01:08:32,550 --> 01:08:39,150
21 Okay, that's better than the 20 1224 Yeah.

644
01:08:40,440 --> 01:08:53,820
Yeah. All right. So, um, I'm going to let Harry introduce himself, but I don't know her well, because I heard that she's in Iowa with me, so.

645
01:08:54,480 --> 01:08:57,810
Yeah. So, yeah, we go way back. When did you graduate?

646
01:08:57,960 --> 01:09:02,520
2019. So that way back, I don't know. That is not that way.

647
01:09:02,520 --> 01:09:05,549
That. Well, I guess in COVID time.

648
01:09:05,550 --> 01:09:17,020
Right. And it feels a lot longer. Yeah. Yeah, I actually either totally forget it was asking me I have to go to a meeting and it is really important.

649
01:09:17,020 --> 01:09:22,950
So it is one of the questions I want to be in Israel and they said, well, why don't you ask here?

650
01:09:22,950 --> 01:09:29,189
And I was thinking, oh, two years ago you said you couldn't have been here to the hospital.

651
01:09:29,190 --> 01:09:35,160
Yeah, it was four years ago. Oh, wow. Oh, okay.

652
01:09:35,550 --> 01:09:39,460
Yeah. So as diclofenac things that I'm carries and I'm one of our infection prevention is

653
01:09:39,510 --> 01:09:46,440
over at the health system and I also started my career in interest in this field.

654
01:09:47,640 --> 01:09:53,720
On the other side of the podium where you guys are sitting as well. So I was a chip intern as well.

655
01:09:53,730 --> 01:09:57,480
I was fortunate to do my project and some water quality.

656
01:09:57,480 --> 01:10:04,230
I actually worked with that custodian we saw get right looking at, you know,

657
01:10:04,260 --> 01:10:10,170
appropriateness of sink designs and potential risk for splash contamination.

658
01:10:11,580 --> 01:10:17,100
After that, I joined the department as our hand hygiene data coordinator,

659
01:10:17,640 --> 01:10:27,870
did that for about a little under a year and then transitioned to an infection prevention test role right as the pandemic started.

660
01:10:27,870 --> 01:10:33,270
So really got quite the adventure jumping into a forest fire.

661
01:10:34,170 --> 01:10:37,079
Great way to start a career. You have to learn on your feet.

662
01:10:37,080 --> 01:10:42,630
And I think a lot of things that we learned during the pandemic was really how to be nimble and and make adjustments quickly.

663
01:10:44,010 --> 01:10:50,010
So, yeah, now, you know, I am still one of our co IP leads for our hand hygiene program.

664
01:10:50,310 --> 01:10:57,450
I'm not with me here today as Maureen Mullen, who is our program manager and our department manager over our analysts.

665
01:10:57,450 --> 01:11:03,210
And then also Ricky Brown, who is our other IP co-lead for hand hygiene, who is also our data coordinator.

666
01:11:03,600 --> 01:11:06,630
So you'll see her name and a few slides through here and there.

667
01:11:07,230 --> 01:11:09,870
But she was off today, so she can't join us.

668
01:11:09,870 --> 01:11:19,739
But other areas that I focused on in my IP work include, you know, respiratory care, interventional radiology.

669
01:11:19,740 --> 01:11:26,490
I cover our medical pulmonary units and I've got a number of ambulatory outpatient sites that I cover.

670
01:11:27,060 --> 01:11:32,850
And then I also lead our work in mold surveillance. So that's just a little bit about me.

671
01:11:34,350 --> 01:11:39,440
I did bring usually when we do this class, we usually like to bring a little deaf site.

672
01:11:39,810 --> 01:11:42,930
What better than a bunch of packets of hand sanitizer to talk about?

673
01:11:43,810 --> 01:11:46,590
So feel free to grab some on your way out or in between.

674
01:11:47,070 --> 01:11:52,799
I am going to pass around a stack of papers that are basically just the data collection forms that you guys are.

675
01:11:52,800 --> 01:12:02,760
Just grab about 25 or so. That should be now and then we'll send out a sign up sheet and as you guys head out but to to kick things off,

676
01:12:02,760 --> 01:12:12,210
I thought that maybe we could start talking about just an overview of what setting up a hand hygiene surveillance program looks like.

677
01:12:12,810 --> 01:12:17,100
I'll share a little bit about the specific program we have here at Michigan Medicine,

678
01:12:17,430 --> 01:12:24,149
and we'll go through some of the standard training that we utilize for our actual observers,

679
01:12:24,150 --> 01:12:27,180
which I know some of you guys are or have been previously.

680
01:12:28,530 --> 01:12:36,599
And then I'll talk about some of the intervention strategies that helped us be successful in our hand hygiene journey,

681
01:12:36,600 --> 01:12:40,740
and then we'll go over some scenarios to wrap things up.

682
01:12:44,560 --> 01:12:54,160
So obviously, like most surveillance programs, usually there's a reason why you want to, you know, perform surveillance on something.

683
01:12:55,570 --> 01:13:02,350
So hopefully during your pre class reading work or watching that and having very you kind of learned about the history of hand hygiene,

684
01:13:02,740 --> 01:13:04,629
you'll learned about the importance of it.

685
01:13:04,630 --> 01:13:12,790
I think it's pretty obvious to a lot of us who are more familiar with the field why hand hygiene is so important.

686
01:13:14,480 --> 01:13:19,650
It really is a pinnacle of infection prevention work and prevention of disease transmission.

687
01:13:19,690 --> 01:13:23,770
It really touches all aspects of infection prevention work.

688
01:13:25,030 --> 01:13:28,989
You know, it applies to all different age prevention strategies.

689
01:13:28,990 --> 01:13:35,860
So, you know, we're talking about prevention of catheter, urinary associated infections or Cordis, central line infections.

690
01:13:35,860 --> 01:13:44,379
Collapse is generally associated events of AIDS, CHF, you know, hand hygiene has a role in every one of those aspects.

691
01:13:44,380 --> 01:13:53,440
So really that's why we perform surveillance, because we want to make sure that we're doing everything that we can to prevent transmission.

692
01:13:53,460 --> 01:13:58,960
Obviously, hand hygiene alone is not going to be 100% slam dunk to preventing infections, but it is a key element.

693
01:13:59,500 --> 01:14:05,860
And without that as a groundwork, I think, you know, a lot of places would struggle with infection rates.

694
01:14:06,430 --> 01:14:16,719
So I kind of just in a general sense, kind of categorized the the four main elements I think,

695
01:14:16,720 --> 01:14:19,180
that you need to consider when putting together hand hygiene.

696
01:14:19,180 --> 01:14:25,120
So a balanced program after you've decided that you're going to do it right after you know why you want to do it.

697
01:14:25,690 --> 01:14:28,570
So that's collection, analysis, dissemination and the response.

698
01:14:28,960 --> 01:14:36,140
So in a sense, in the sense of hand hygiene, really, there are a couple of ways that you could collect this data, right?

699
01:14:36,160 --> 01:14:45,040
Like there's direct method. So when we're talking about direct methods, that's usually going to be somebody directly observing.

700
01:14:45,040 --> 01:14:48,820
So that could be either an overt method where, you know,

701
01:14:48,970 --> 01:14:55,299
the person that you're measuring compliance for knows that they're being monitored, but they are also be a convert method.

702
01:14:55,300 --> 01:14:58,450
Right. And that's what we're going to talk more about and that's what you guys will be doing.

703
01:14:58,450 --> 01:15:04,570
But that covert method is really that people don't know that you're there at that moment watching them.

704
01:15:05,110 --> 01:15:09,220
And obviously there are, you know, different benefits.

705
01:15:09,370 --> 01:15:15,849
And so the different pros and cons of each kind of method of a direct observation with overt,

706
01:15:15,850 --> 01:15:22,270
obviously you are able to, you know, because you're not concerned about staying anonymous.

707
01:15:22,270 --> 01:15:27,400
You can provide just in time training and coaching. You can intervene on the spot and correct that deficit.

708
01:15:28,120 --> 01:15:35,709
With all of our covert observations, obviously the whole sense of that is to stay anonymous,

709
01:15:35,710 --> 01:15:39,310
not letting the people being observed know that you're actually watching them.

710
01:15:39,910 --> 01:15:45,940
Because we do know that, you know, behavior does change if people know they're being watched, right?

711
01:15:45,940 --> 01:15:55,000
So that's the whole Hawthorn effect. There are other collection methods that hand hygiene surveillance programs can be used in.

712
01:15:55,270 --> 01:16:01,479
So indirect methods would be kind of those where you're kind of using a proxy.

713
01:16:01,480 --> 01:16:09,730
So you're measuring product usage, for example, how much soap is being utilized, how much alcohol based hand rub is being utilized.

714
01:16:10,000 --> 01:16:13,690
And obviously there are pros and cons for that method, right?

715
01:16:13,690 --> 01:16:18,219
So some pros, you know, there is no opportunity for bias there.

716
01:16:18,220 --> 01:16:21,850
Right. Because it's, you know, discreet measurement of what's being used.

717
01:16:22,210 --> 01:16:28,870
But some kinds, you know, is that it doesn't necessarily discriminate between who is using software.

718
01:16:29,170 --> 01:16:39,790
A lot of times we're most interested in health care workers. But you by measuring use that you don't know that that's, you know, visitors, employees,

719
01:16:40,000 --> 01:16:50,530
patients it is you know, similar to but also, you know, not necessarily knowing what your denominator is like.

720
01:16:50,530 --> 01:16:56,019
What do you actually use this over what opportunities right with whereas direct method, you know,

721
01:16:56,020 --> 01:17:01,090
you know how many opportunities that were watched versus the ones that were compliant.

722
01:17:01,210 --> 01:17:11,920
And then really something more newer I would say is automated or electronic systems, which, you know, obviously they're marketed to.

723
01:17:15,000 --> 01:17:16,979
Suggests that there is no bias. And I think there is.

724
01:17:16,980 --> 01:17:25,590
And because it's again, it's not an individual person, it's not subjected to those biases, but oftentimes they are very expensive to implement.

725
01:17:26,220 --> 01:17:34,610
A lot of health systems don't actually use electronic systems because of the cost and effort that it needs to take to implement such a system.

726
01:17:34,620 --> 01:17:41,009
There are also other considerations because a lot of these systems do require some sort of badge tracking.

727
01:17:41,010 --> 01:17:47,790
So staff usually wear a specific badge or something so that the system can detect when a when they go in.

728
01:17:48,120 --> 01:17:55,469
There's usually a sensor on the hand sanitizer soap dispenser that, you know, detects presence or utilization of that.

729
01:17:55,470 --> 01:18:03,690
So there are some, you know, potential ethical or controversial topics or concerns related to tracking,

730
01:18:03,690 --> 01:18:07,440
I guess, in having, you know, specific individual level data.

731
01:18:08,190 --> 01:18:12,960
So I would say those are your three main types of collection methods.

732
01:18:13,290 --> 01:18:16,739
And then also kind of included in collecting is just what are you going to measure?

733
01:18:16,740 --> 01:18:20,399
Right? So there are a number of different metrics that you can measure.

734
01:18:20,400 --> 01:18:27,450
Everybody's different hygiene components. So that is something that's really good to think about just simply in, out.

735
01:18:27,450 --> 01:18:30,860
So entering a room, actually being a room in between certain tasks.
