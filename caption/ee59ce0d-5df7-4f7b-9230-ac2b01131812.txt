1
00:00:04,087 --> 00:00:08,331
Hi, I'm Jackie White and I'm one of the infection preventionists in the infection

2
00:00:08,331 --> 00:00:10,559
prevention and epidemiology department.

3
00:00:10,559 --> 00:00:17,264
And I will be going over a review of the principles of surveillance.

4
00:00:17,264 --> 00:00:18,477
What is surveillance?

5
00:00:18,477 --> 00:00:23,311
A surveillance system is an information loop or a cycle.

6
00:00:23,311 --> 00:00:29,358
And I really like the diagram in the lower right hand corner of the slide.

7
00:00:29,358 --> 00:00:34,213
Surveillance starts and ends with communication and action.

8
00:00:34,213 --> 00:00:39,172
And if you look at the this diagram you'll see the flow of surveillance data.

9
00:00:39,172 --> 00:00:43,829
So, you collect your data, you collate it, you report it, you analyze it,

10
00:00:43,829 --> 00:00:47,065
you interpret it, you disseminate it and you use it.

11
00:00:47,065 --> 00:00:51,518
And then based on that you'll collect more data and

12
00:00:51,518 --> 00:00:55,360
then the cycle goes around again and again.

13
00:00:55,360 --> 00:00:59,458
The elements of surveillance include a risk assessment,

14
00:00:59,458 --> 00:01:03,053
creating your surveillance plan, case finding,

15
00:01:03,053 --> 00:01:07,903
data collection analysis of data, conducting a needs assessment,

16
00:01:07,903 --> 00:01:13,949
distributing the data and then assessing the effectiveness of your interventions.

17
00:01:16,872 --> 00:01:20,572
And I'll go through each one of those elements in a little more detail.

18
00:01:20,572 --> 00:01:23,727
So the first step is to conduct a risk assessment.

19
00:01:23,727 --> 00:01:28,162
A risk assessment is required annually by the joint commission.

20
00:01:28,162 --> 00:01:32,904
Your risk assessment you want to assess the likelihood of

21
00:01:32,904 --> 00:01:37,955
events that occurring that will impact patients and staff.

22
00:01:37,955 --> 00:01:42,304
You also determine the severity of the impact if that event occurs.

23
00:01:42,304 --> 00:01:47,569
So for example, institutions do it differently.

24
00:01:47,569 --> 00:01:51,832
You can categorize it based on high medium or low or

25
00:01:51,832 --> 00:01:57,222
you can assign numbers like one, three, three through five.

26
00:01:57,222 --> 00:01:59,474
Whatever works for your institution.

27
00:01:59,474 --> 00:02:05,098
And for example, whether impacts are on a risk assessment,

28
00:02:05,098 --> 00:02:11,399
tornadoes, for example in our geographic area versus collapses.

29
00:02:11,399 --> 00:02:14,237
So, based on your risk assessment,

30
00:02:14,237 --> 00:02:18,270
you use your ranking system to set your priorities.

31
00:02:18,270 --> 00:02:22,984
However, many functions are actually required by regulatory agencies or

32
00:02:22,984 --> 00:02:24,792
hospital administration.

33
00:02:24,792 --> 00:02:30,827
So those regulatory agencies include the joint commission CMS et cetera.

34
00:02:30,827 --> 00:02:35,221
So, one example of this is cloud surveillance that is required.

35
00:02:35,221 --> 00:02:39,989
So, even if you rank it as low, low likelihood of collapse, occurring and

36
00:02:39,989 --> 00:02:44,924
low severity of impact, which really classy wouldn't be considered that.

37
00:02:44,924 --> 00:02:47,301
But if you did categorize it like that,

38
00:02:47,301 --> 00:02:51,204
you would still be required to conduct surveillance for those.

39
00:02:56,537 --> 00:03:02,792
The next element is creating your surveillance plan.

40
00:03:02,792 --> 00:03:05,894
So you wanna think about who what and where for

41
00:03:05,894 --> 00:03:10,152
example, do you want to track infections in all in patients?

42
00:03:10,152 --> 00:03:13,480
So do you want your surveillance to be hospital wide?

43
00:03:13,480 --> 00:03:18,360
For example, clouds and Cody's our hospital wide surveillance or

44
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:20,335
do you want to do targeted.

45
00:03:20,335 --> 00:03:25,430
So you track infections that are of particular interest or high risk.

46
00:03:25,430 --> 00:03:31,031
So, an example of this surgical site infections is a targeted HAI.

47
00:03:31,031 --> 00:03:35,525
So, we at Michigan medicine do not track surgical site infections in

48
00:03:35,525 --> 00:03:37,854
every single surgical procedure.

49
00:03:37,854 --> 00:03:39,956
Our surgical service there are just too many.

50
00:03:39,956 --> 00:03:42,870
So, we target those that are high risk or

51
00:03:42,870 --> 00:03:47,258
that are required like I said by those regulatory agencies.

52
00:03:47,258 --> 00:03:49,812
And then how are you gonna conduct your surveillance?

53
00:03:49,812 --> 00:03:54,740
Are you going to do prospective surveillance where you look forward in

54
00:03:54,740 --> 00:03:56,418
time or do it real time.

55
00:03:56,418 --> 00:04:00,517
So this is initiated when the patient is still under your care.

56
00:04:00,517 --> 00:04:04,149
The advantages of doing prospective surveillance include,

57
00:04:04,149 --> 00:04:07,096
the ability to capture information in real time.

58
00:04:07,096 --> 00:04:10,439
You can go and talk to the nurses and talk to the doctors.

59
00:04:10,439 --> 00:04:13,533
You may be able to observe findings that

60
00:04:13,533 --> 00:04:17,481
are actually not recorded in the patient record.

61
00:04:17,481 --> 00:04:20,273
Retrospective is another way to conduct your surveillance.

62
00:04:20,273 --> 00:04:21,830
This is where you look back in time.

63
00:04:21,830 --> 00:04:26,823
This is often after the patient has been discharged the advantages to this.

64
00:04:26,823 --> 00:04:30,875
It does allow for a comprehensive review of sequential events and

65
00:04:30,875 --> 00:04:32,356
it's more efficient.

66
00:04:32,356 --> 00:04:39,452
So, you're able to kind of look at the chart and see the complete picture.

67
00:04:39,452 --> 00:04:41,020
There's passive surveillance.

68
00:04:41,020 --> 00:04:42,819
This is where the data comes to you.

69
00:04:42,819 --> 00:04:47,063
So for example, you get your positive cultures, blood cultures,

70
00:04:47,063 --> 00:04:51,241
cultures and your cultures etcetera from microbiology reports.

71
00:04:51,241 --> 00:04:56,759
Or maybe the unit notifies you that they are seeing patients larger number

72
00:04:56,759 --> 00:05:02,909
of patients with positive respiratory cultures for Acinetobacter for example.

73
00:05:02,909 --> 00:05:05,493
And then others you may use the discharge diagnosis as well.

74
00:05:05,493 --> 00:05:08,150
That's another method of passive surveillance.

75
00:05:08,150 --> 00:05:11,677
Passive surveillance is commonly used for health care, acquired infections and

76
00:05:11,677 --> 00:05:12,658
specific organisms.

77
00:05:12,658 --> 00:05:15,538
So if you want to do a pathogen profile for a unit,

78
00:05:15,538 --> 00:05:17,733
you would do passive surveillance.

79
00:05:17,733 --> 00:05:22,268
Active surveillance is when you actively go and you look for

80
00:05:22,268 --> 00:05:24,544
cases for surgery patients.

81
00:05:24,544 --> 00:05:26,357
For example, our patients on ventilators.

82
00:05:26,357 --> 00:05:31,049
So, our ventilator associated events, surveillance is active.

83
00:05:31,049 --> 00:05:36,616
Some of our surgical site infection, surveillance is active surveillance.

84
00:05:36,616 --> 00:05:40,019
This is where for example for, surgical site infections for

85
00:05:40,019 --> 00:05:44,504
some services we actually take the entire list of patients who had a procedure.

86
00:05:44,504 --> 00:05:49,344
And then we go into the medical charts search engine and search for

87
00:05:49,344 --> 00:05:53,658
key terms that may indicate the patient had an infection.

88
00:05:56,318 --> 00:06:01,377
And then next, the next element of surveillance is case finding and

89
00:06:01,377 --> 00:06:03,698
followed by data collection.

90
00:06:03,698 --> 00:06:05,124
So I like to talk to these.

91
00:06:05,124 --> 00:06:07,638
Talk about these two together.

92
00:06:07,638 --> 00:06:08,914
So how do you get the data?

93
00:06:08,914 --> 00:06:13,039
Well, we can just kind of talked about that with this surveillance plan

94
00:06:13,039 --> 00:06:13,870
a little bit.

95
00:06:13,870 --> 00:06:15,416
But, how do you get the data?

96
00:06:15,416 --> 00:06:17,328
Do you use IT systems?

97
00:06:17,328 --> 00:06:23,836
So, for example the medical chart, the electronic medical record.

98
00:06:23,836 --> 00:06:27,290
Do you get a specific report from the microbiology lab or

99
00:06:27,290 --> 00:06:31,406
like I said maybe the clinician or provider on the unit calls you and

100
00:06:31,406 --> 00:06:35,893
tells you that there's a concerning number of positive cultures of with

101
00:06:35,893 --> 00:06:38,346
the same type of bacteria for example.

102
00:06:38,346 --> 00:06:40,486
For case finding the CDC.

103
00:06:40,486 --> 00:06:43,789
The NHSN, the National Healthcare Safety Network.

104
00:06:43,789 --> 00:06:47,398
Through the CDC definitions are the gold standard.

105
00:06:47,398 --> 00:06:50,498
They are subject specific and objective.

106
00:06:50,498 --> 00:06:55,365
So it gives you a specific, does the patient have a temperature of greater than

107
00:06:55,365 --> 00:06:58,922
38 degrees doesn't say does the patient have a fever?

108
00:06:58,922 --> 00:07:03,954
These definitions do ensure reproducibility of the data.

109
00:07:03,954 --> 00:07:08,438
So you always want to refer to standard published validated definitions to

110
00:07:08,438 --> 00:07:11,079
ensure the accuracy of your surveillance.

111
00:07:11,079 --> 00:07:15,310
Everyone in your department must use the same definitions and then however,

112
00:07:15,310 --> 00:07:18,044
you also have to think if the definition changed,

113
00:07:18,044 --> 00:07:21,319
the comparability of rates over time will be compromised.

114
00:07:21,319 --> 00:07:26,882
So a few years ago the CDC made a fairly large change in their cloudy definition.

115
00:07:26,882 --> 00:07:32,024
And so you just if that happens with any type of surveillance definition

116
00:07:32,024 --> 00:07:37,851
you just should denoted on your graph or whatever data you're presenting just so

117
00:07:37,851 --> 00:07:42,147
that people are aware that there was a shift in definition.

118
00:07:42,147 --> 00:07:44,532
And then you wanna analyze your data.

119
00:07:44,532 --> 00:07:48,849
So, for HAI data we use rates.

120
00:07:48,849 --> 00:07:53,634
So the numerator over the denominator times 1000 where your numerator is

121
00:07:53,634 --> 00:07:57,913
the number of events and your denominator is the population at risk.

122
00:07:57,913 --> 00:08:00,407
When you're looking at HAI's, so for

123
00:08:00,407 --> 00:08:05,095
example collapses the central line associated bloodstream infection or

124
00:08:05,095 --> 00:08:08,811
Cody's catheter associated urinary tract infections.

125
00:08:08,811 --> 00:08:13,724
Your denominator should always be device days when available because that truly is

126
00:08:13,724 --> 00:08:15,204
the population at risk.

127
00:08:15,204 --> 00:08:18,606
If the patient doesn't have a device central line or

128
00:08:18,606 --> 00:08:23,804
the catheter the foley catheter then they cannot have one of those infections.

129
00:08:23,804 --> 00:08:29,927
The denominators these devices are necessary for CDC benchmarking.

130
00:08:29,927 --> 00:08:34,692
And like I said it's important to really look at the population at risk

131
00:08:34,692 --> 00:08:39,640
because the infection risk increases with the use of invasive devices.

132
00:08:39,640 --> 00:08:43,599
The higher risk with the longer duration of your device.

133
00:08:43,599 --> 00:08:47,042
If device days are not available, you can use patient days.

134
00:08:47,042 --> 00:08:52,132
Just understanding that your rate may appear to be lower than it is.

135
00:08:52,132 --> 00:08:57,509
Should you have your more appropriate denominator.

136
00:08:57,509 --> 00:09:01,590
So let's look at an example of analyzing data.

137
00:09:01,590 --> 00:09:07,029
This is a graph of the number of classes from the ICU.

138
00:09:07,029 --> 00:09:08,725
So again just number of classes.

139
00:09:08,725 --> 00:09:12,322
So you can see there are a couple of clusters,

140
00:09:12,322 --> 00:09:17,247
one from January to march and another from June through August

141
00:09:17,247 --> 00:09:21,904
with a couple other smatterings in October and December.

142
00:09:21,904 --> 00:09:24,519
So if you're looking at this ground, what would you think about it?

143
00:09:24,519 --> 00:09:32,364
I would think maybe there was patient acuity may be increased in January.

144
00:09:32,364 --> 00:09:35,480
Maybe they were sicker patients.

145
00:09:35,480 --> 00:09:38,299
Maybe they were just drawing more blood cultures during that time.

146
00:09:38,299 --> 00:09:43,885
Same thing with June through August maybe also in December.

147
00:09:43,885 --> 00:09:44,474
But now,

148
00:09:44,474 --> 00:09:49,347
this is a graph of from that same time period of the number of central line days.

149
00:09:49,347 --> 00:09:54,083
So you can see there's an upward trend until about August really

150
00:09:54,083 --> 00:09:58,117
with a steeper trend from really may through August and

151
00:09:58,117 --> 00:10:03,046
then it starts to decrease in level out through the end of the year.

152
00:10:03,046 --> 00:10:07,819
So looking at this, I might think it may be actually

153
00:10:07,819 --> 00:10:13,151
the patient acuity increased over those summer months.

154
00:10:13,151 --> 00:10:18,145
Maybe there were more they needed to use more central lines because

155
00:10:18,145 --> 00:10:20,471
of the acuity of the patients.

156
00:10:20,471 --> 00:10:24,341
Maybe in July our new faculty and new residents come so

157
00:10:24,341 --> 00:10:29,071
maybe they like to use central lines and they aren't aware that we

158
00:10:29,071 --> 00:10:33,984
have robust programs to reduce the number of central lines we have.

159
00:10:33,984 --> 00:10:36,667
Just a couple of thoughts.

160
00:10:36,667 --> 00:10:41,539
But when you put those together, now what do you see you actually see

161
00:10:41,539 --> 00:10:44,959
that there was a higher [INAUDIBLE] in January and

162
00:10:44,959 --> 00:10:49,921
February in particular and even December rather than the lower class

163
00:10:49,921 --> 00:10:54,911
the rate over those summer months when we saw more central line days.

164
00:10:54,911 --> 00:11:00,009
So, this when you calculate that rate it really takes

165
00:11:00,009 --> 00:11:05,124
into account patient acuity patient type et cetera.

166
00:11:05,124 --> 00:11:10,006
So then you can direct your interventions more to what was happening in those

167
00:11:10,006 --> 00:11:14,978
earlier months of the year, obviously carrying it through the entire year.

168
00:11:14,978 --> 00:11:22,094
But you can kind of start with that beginning January, February time frame.

169
00:11:22,094 --> 00:11:27,497
After you analyze your an additional part of analyzing data I should say.

170
00:11:27,497 --> 00:11:32,239
This is when you compare your data to other data it allows you to identify

171
00:11:32,239 --> 00:11:33,909
areas for improvement.

172
00:11:33,909 --> 00:11:35,556
But what do you benchmark too?

173
00:11:35,556 --> 00:11:38,799
You can benchmark to the historical unit data.

174
00:11:38,799 --> 00:11:42,919
Can also benchmark to CDC, NHSN benchmarks but you have to be a little

175
00:11:42,919 --> 00:11:46,908
bit careful with that if you're gonna benchmark a rate to the CDC.

176
00:11:46,908 --> 00:11:51,055
And I'll explain a little bit why on the next slide.

177
00:11:51,055 --> 00:11:54,558
You can also benchmark to external quality collaborative et cetera.

178
00:11:54,558 --> 00:11:57,338
Which we do occasionally.

179
00:11:57,338 --> 00:12:03,009
And then you can also benchmark to data that is published in the literature.

180
00:12:03,009 --> 00:12:04,282
What should you not benchmark to?

181
00:12:04,282 --> 00:12:09,144
You don't want to benchmark to historical data from other units that's like

182
00:12:09,144 --> 00:12:11,103
comparing apples to oranges.

183
00:12:11,103 --> 00:12:14,783
Nor do you want to benchmark to other hospitals that have a different patient

184
00:12:14,783 --> 00:12:15,480
population?

185
00:12:15,480 --> 00:12:18,942
For example, we are a large teaching academic teaching hospitals.

186
00:12:18,942 --> 00:12:22,336
So, we don't want to benchmark to a small community hospital

187
00:12:22,336 --> 00:12:26,926
where the programs are very different than patient population is very different.

188
00:12:26,926 --> 00:12:32,837
The patient acuity is very different.

189
00:12:32,837 --> 00:12:38,334
So, I mentioned benchmarking to the CDC, NHSN benchmarks.

190
00:12:38,334 --> 00:12:43,572
So, historically we benchmark to rates that were published by NHSN.

191
00:12:43,572 --> 00:12:47,712
However, NHSN has now moved to what's called an SIR or

192
00:12:47,712 --> 00:12:50,235
standardized infection ratio.

193
00:12:50,235 --> 00:12:54,748
And this ratio is a summary measure that's used to track HAI's.

194
00:12:54,748 --> 00:12:59,626
This ratio adjusts for patients of varying risk where risk factors

195
00:12:59,626 --> 00:13:04,864
significantly associated with differences in infection incidents.

196
00:13:04,864 --> 00:13:08,238
This ratio actually compares the actual number

197
00:13:08,238 --> 00:13:11,368
of HAI's with the baseline US experience.

198
00:13:11,368 --> 00:13:14,630
So, hospitals submit their data into NHSN.

199
00:13:14,630 --> 00:13:19,082
And then just then takes those raw numbers of infections and

200
00:13:19,082 --> 00:13:24,083
calculates this ratio of based on the type of institution you are.

201
00:13:24,083 --> 00:13:27,685
So for example like I said Michigan medicine is an academic teaching

202
00:13:27,685 --> 00:13:31,106
institution and based on the specific unit you're looking at.

203
00:13:31,106 --> 00:13:36,878
So, we could look at academic teaching surgical intensive care units and

204
00:13:36,878 --> 00:13:40,894
we would calculate SIR, for that particular HAI.

205
00:13:40,894 --> 00:13:45,835
And that will tell us the number of infections that we have that

206
00:13:45,835 --> 00:13:50,872
are observed over what would be expected based on other similar

207
00:13:50,872 --> 00:13:55,736
institutions and similar units that are reporting to NHSN.

208
00:13:55,736 --> 00:13:59,536
So it gives us it's really an observed over expected ratio.

209
00:13:59,536 --> 00:14:04,677
So an SIR of greater than 1.0 indicates that more HAI's were

210
00:14:04,677 --> 00:14:09,723
observed at your institution that your in that one particular

211
00:14:09,723 --> 00:14:14,296
unit than would be predicted based on this US baseline.

212
00:14:14,296 --> 00:14:19,418
And SIR of less than 1.0 indicates that fewer H AI's were observed

213
00:14:19,418 --> 00:14:24,290
in your population than were predicted based on the US baseline.

214
00:14:26,582 --> 00:14:32,766
So, after you have analyzed your data, you will use it to conduct a needs assessment.

215
00:14:32,766 --> 00:14:35,376
You're gonna use your data to determine the next steps.

216
00:14:35,376 --> 00:14:39,170
Do you need to continue monitoring?

217
00:14:39,170 --> 00:14:42,190
Do you stop monitoring?

218
00:14:42,190 --> 00:14:44,873
Do you stop tracking that one particular surgical service?

219
00:14:44,873 --> 00:14:46,890
Do you need additional information?

220
00:14:46,890 --> 00:14:51,572
Do you need to go out and do practice observation, process surveillance,

221
00:14:51,572 --> 00:14:56,571
observe what staff are actually doing while they're providing patient care?

222
00:14:56,571 --> 00:15:01,569
Maybe you realize that there's a gap with one particular aspect of care.

223
00:15:01,569 --> 00:15:05,040
So you provide education and conduct competency testing.

224
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:08,759
Or maybe you need to just revise a policy or evaluate equipment may be

225
00:15:08,759 --> 00:15:13,077
brought in a new type of equipment and you saw a big increase in your infection.

226
00:15:13,077 --> 00:15:16,996
So you might wanna likely go back and evaluate that piece of equipment,

227
00:15:16,996 --> 00:15:21,700
make sure it's being cleaned properly, make sure there haven't been any recalls,

228
00:15:21,700 --> 00:15:25,122
whatever the case may, make sure it's being used properly.

229
00:15:25,122 --> 00:15:27,687
And then finally, you wanna distribute your data and

230
00:15:27,687 --> 00:15:30,028
assess the effectiveness of the intervention.

231
00:15:30,028 --> 00:15:33,092
So when you distribute your data it's gonna go

232
00:15:33,092 --> 00:15:37,974
to quality groups will go to staff in the areas that you're working with.

233
00:15:37,974 --> 00:15:42,036
It will go to the your institutions infection control committee.

234
00:15:42,036 --> 00:15:46,462
It will go to the executive levels of your institution.

235
00:15:46,462 --> 00:15:47,935
It will go to collaborative groups.

236
00:15:47,935 --> 00:15:52,037
So, many institutions participate in various collaborative we do here at

237
00:15:52,037 --> 00:15:53,217
Michigan medicine.

238
00:15:53,217 --> 00:15:55,766
So our data goes to those groups as well.

239
00:15:55,766 --> 00:15:59,132
And then also regulatory agencies like CMS,

240
00:15:59,132 --> 00:16:03,038
the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid for example.

241
00:16:03,038 --> 00:16:07,600
And then, you'll see this diagram, the plan.

242
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:12,853
Do check act PDCA or PDCAH and then you will start all over you

243
00:16:12,853 --> 00:16:18,438
just keep doing that to continue in improving patient safety.

244
00:16:18,438 --> 00:16:22,170
And then finally, your goals, you'll set your goals,

245
00:16:22,170 --> 00:16:24,969
you want to decrease your rates each year,

246
00:16:24,969 --> 00:16:30,055
make sure your unit data falls below those CDC benchmarks or that have an SIR.

247
00:16:30,055 --> 00:16:31,499
That is less than 1.0.

248
00:16:31,499 --> 00:16:35,957
But even better, the ultimate goal is to have zero infections.

249
00:16:40,779 --> 00:16:44,786
