1
00:00:13,110 --> 00:00:16,950
Okay. I think we're going to get started. Can everyone hear me all right?

2
00:00:17,750 --> 00:00:21,500
Yes. Okay. So today we're going to go through an in-class activity.

3
00:00:21,510 --> 00:00:27,930
It should be posted on canvas under the modules tab if you don't have access to a computer or anything.

4
00:00:27,930 --> 00:00:31,890
I do have hard copies up here. If you need one, you can come and grab one.

5
00:00:33,450 --> 00:00:39,870
The in-class activity is going to have questions that similar to the homework question, so hopefully it'll help you in answering the homework.

6
00:00:40,560 --> 00:00:49,410
So for the first ten or 15 minutes, I'm going to have you guys either individually or in groups of two or three, go through the questions in part one.

7
00:00:50,130 --> 00:00:54,990
If you have any questions while you're going through it, feel free to ask me if you need any help.

8
00:00:54,990 --> 00:00:59,040
And then we'll go over the part one answers and then we'll do part two afterwards.

9
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:09,470
Yes. So this is just strictly as practice.

10
00:01:09,490 --> 00:01:13,910
You don't turn it in. It's not four points. Yeah.

11
00:01:53,050 --> 00:01:57,240
Yes. They are going to put it back together a valid.

12
00:01:58,620 --> 00:02:11,500
After giving us 15 minutes to do this as long as we got over it.

13
00:02:11,710 --> 00:02:16,250
You can look these things.

14
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:45,630
I'm sorry. We are not going to eat this.

15
00:03:03,630 --> 00:03:09,660
Yes. How do you like border?

16
00:03:11,990 --> 00:03:15,890
Yeah. There are people like us. Like.

17
00:03:27,770 --> 00:03:32,110
It is vital that.

18
00:03:55,960 --> 00:04:06,170
My career, I.

19
00:04:22,780 --> 00:04:53,380
There. Yeah.

20
00:04:54,160 --> 00:05:02,540
Yeah. I'm on.

21
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:27,400
I know. But I think the question that.

22
00:05:33,740 --> 00:06:04,510
Yeah. You know. I was trying.

23
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:39,830
But. I.

24
00:06:43,180 --> 00:06:48,620
Feel like. We're having.

25
00:07:15,080 --> 00:07:23,780
Yeah, you're right.

26
00:07:34,010 --> 00:07:38,650
I know it.

27
00:07:42,170 --> 00:07:53,160
So. Yeah.

28
00:07:58,580 --> 00:08:03,890
Oh. Now the truth.

29
00:08:08,990 --> 00:08:14,440
Well, that sounds like.

30
00:08:21,910 --> 00:08:30,160
I love. It's like.

31
00:08:42,570 --> 00:08:50,140
Your place. Need to five.

32
00:08:58,830 --> 00:09:04,140
And now it's going down. These decisions are.

33
00:09:12,390 --> 00:09:40,270
Yes. Like I wasn't working and my.

34
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:52,720
Was. You see, it was.

35
00:10:04,540 --> 00:10:15,810
Cheryl. Yeah.

36
00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:48,790
Oh. Think.

37
00:10:54,300 --> 00:11:10,170
So. 40 years.

38
00:11:12,950 --> 00:11:24,350
Yeah, that's a good point because it. So that.

39
00:11:44,490 --> 00:11:55,530
That's right. Yeah. Be. Was.

40
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:20,540
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

41
00:12:20,540 --> 00:12:29,510
But it's not, you know. It was the.

42
00:12:32,440 --> 00:12:46,100
Our. Yeah, I.

43
00:12:53,250 --> 00:13:09,660
We. You know, if you.

44
00:13:12,280 --> 00:13:34,520
We get. But what?

45
00:13:41,130 --> 00:14:09,600
I think. Yeah.

46
00:14:16,190 --> 00:14:19,210
I get so.

47
00:14:24,170 --> 00:14:28,460
Thank you for having me.

48
00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:40,040
Oh, yeah. Yes.

49
00:14:47,050 --> 00:14:53,140
Okay. I think we're going to start going over the answers to part one so we don't run out of time for part two.

50
00:14:53,890 --> 00:15:01,090
So for some of them, I'll ask for you guys to answer them, but then others I'll just give you the answers.

51
00:15:02,200 --> 00:15:08,500
So it says a group of 500 girls had their first menstrual period before their 11th birthday.

52
00:15:09,100 --> 00:15:12,130
40 years later, 50 had developed breast cancer.

53
00:15:12,550 --> 00:15:19,540
You are a researcher interested in determining whether exposure to early menarche caused these people to develop breast cancer.

54
00:15:20,170 --> 00:15:29,080
So for question one or question A and says in one question, describe the counterfactual question and whether it's observable or not.

55
00:15:29,860 --> 00:15:40,510
So for this one, you're going to look at if all things are equal, had those 500 girls had their first period after their 11th birthday,

56
00:15:41,140 --> 00:15:47,320
what proportion would have developed breast cancer in order to determine if you have a causal effect or not?

57
00:15:47,710 --> 00:15:54,070
You have to know what would have happened to that group under the exposure and not under the exposure.

58
00:15:54,100 --> 00:15:59,040
So in this case, you know what happened if they're exposed to early menarche.

59
00:15:59,110 --> 00:16:03,790
So you have to know what would have happened to them if they hadn't experience early menarche.

60
00:16:06,680 --> 00:16:13,310
So four Part B is all the information needed to answer the counterfactual question observable?

61
00:16:13,850 --> 00:16:28,990
Does anyone want to give an answer? Yeah.

62
00:16:29,020 --> 00:16:34,480
So you know what happened if they had early menarche, but this kind of goes back to the time machine.

63
00:16:34,490 --> 00:16:39,490
You can't actually you don't actually know what would have happened if they didn't have early menarche.

64
00:16:39,490 --> 00:16:48,310
So that isn't really observable. So then for part, see it says Identify your exposure and outcome.

65
00:16:48,820 --> 00:16:52,330
How would you write the causal question using the notation we learned in class?

66
00:16:52,840 --> 00:17:00,430
Make sure to label any variables you use. So in this case, your exposure and outcome are dichotomous variables.

67
00:17:00,730 --> 00:17:03,760
So for your exposure, that's early menarche.

68
00:17:04,430 --> 00:17:07,810
Either they're experiencing early menarche or they're not.

69
00:17:08,740 --> 00:17:13,450
Your outcome is breast cancer. Did they never develop breast cancer or did they not?

70
00:17:13,870 --> 00:17:19,000
And in this case, we're going to use a four year exposure and you're going to use Y as your outcome.

71
00:17:19,990 --> 00:17:28,060
So then in order to determine what your causal question is, what notation do you have to determine?

72
00:17:28,510 --> 00:17:33,100
Are there counterfactual outcomes equal under the different exposures?

73
00:17:33,910 --> 00:17:40,210
So you're going to express that. As.

74
00:17:44,180 --> 00:17:49,320
The probability. Why?

75
00:17:52,460 --> 00:17:57,460
The counterfactual. Why? Given their exposure.

76
00:18:14,900 --> 00:18:21,080
Does not equal the probability of the marginal counterfactual.

77
00:18:22,560 --> 00:18:34,710
Had they not been exposed? Yeah.

78
00:18:40,690 --> 00:18:44,500
Yeah. So that kind of goes with question B, is it observable or not?

79
00:18:44,950 --> 00:18:52,600
So can you actually know what would have happened to these girls if they had did not have early menarche?

80
00:18:53,080 --> 00:18:55,120
You can't really know. It's not observable.

81
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:11,100
So whenever you're looking at causal relationships, you're always going to compare marginal counterfactual outcomes under their two exposures.

82
00:19:11,610 --> 00:19:15,330
You're going to see if they're different. If they are different, you have a causal effect.

83
00:19:15,720 --> 00:19:28,170
If they're not different, you don't. So then four part D describe an example of a group that could provide observable information

84
00:19:28,590 --> 00:19:33,060
in addition to the group described to determine whether agent menarche caused breast cancer.

85
00:19:33,690 --> 00:19:39,240
Did anyone come up with a possible group? Yeah.

86
00:19:40,410 --> 00:19:46,830
Using that as. With all.

87
00:19:49,840 --> 00:19:53,260
Like are you saying like Ian replaces the probability.

88
00:19:54,040 --> 00:19:58,600
So that depends on what your outcome variable, what scale it's on.

89
00:19:59,050 --> 00:20:08,800
So if you're using continuous data, you're going to use expected outcomes because you can't really take a probability of continuous data.

90
00:20:08,920 --> 00:20:10,720
You're just giving these set of outcomes.

91
00:20:11,140 --> 00:20:17,900
So your summary measure is going to be your mean versus in this case, you're looking at a dichotomous outcome, yes or no?

92
00:20:17,920 --> 00:20:22,060
Did they develop breast cancer? So your summary measure is going to be your probability.

93
00:20:27,590 --> 00:20:35,170
You. Does that answer your question?

94
00:20:35,680 --> 00:20:41,110
Okay. So then back to Part D, does anyone have a comparison group that they came up with?

95
00:20:47,540 --> 00:20:51,890
What was that? Yeah.

96
00:20:51,980 --> 00:20:55,580
So that's one option. That's probably what a lot of people came up with,

97
00:20:56,000 --> 00:21:00,590
is just selecting a group of girls who had their period after their 11th birthday

98
00:21:00,890 --> 00:21:05,300
and compare the proportion who got breast cancer in that group with this group.

99
00:21:06,650 --> 00:21:19,080
There is another way you could possibly. Yeah.

100
00:21:19,080 --> 00:21:22,440
So we already have this group who did have early menarche.

101
00:21:22,440 --> 00:21:31,410
So we're looking at what group can we use to kind of determine the counterfactual had they not experience early menarche?

102
00:21:33,630 --> 00:21:40,510
So. So then you can also think of it as an ideal randomized experiment.

103
00:21:41,020 --> 00:21:46,030
In this case, it's kind of a little weird to think of, but you could, in theory,

104
00:21:46,030 --> 00:21:52,719
randomly assign some girls to have their first period before their 11th birthday and some after,

105
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:58,000
and then observe what proportion in both groups experienced breast cancer.

106
00:21:58,750 --> 00:22:03,000
In this case, that isn't the most logical thing to think of,

107
00:22:03,010 --> 00:22:09,760
but like in terms of if you're using a different exposure outcome, that is one possibility as well.

108
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:23,010
So then for part. E would you expect in that group of 500 girls and then one in your answer to question one D will be exchangeable?

109
00:22:23,400 --> 00:22:29,460
Why or why not? Yeah.

110
00:22:29,470 --> 00:22:38,549
So there could be some. Thing about one of the groups that makes them have early menarche or not.

111
00:22:38,550 --> 00:22:48,110
So if you think of like someone's genes. That could be unique to one person that explains why they have early menarche or not.

112
00:22:48,160 --> 00:22:53,920
So then your groups probably wouldn't be exchangeable because there are some like confounding variable that

113
00:22:53,920 --> 00:23:00,010
could affect in one group when they had their first period and it could be different than the other group.

114
00:23:02,580 --> 00:23:11,460
But if you were thinking in terms of the ideal randomized experiment, so if you actually did that as an option, they actually would be exchangeable.

115
00:23:12,660 --> 00:23:21,420
Because if you're randomly allocating people to the two exposure groups, they should be similar in their characteristics that they are exchangeable.

116
00:23:22,260 --> 00:23:31,590
So your answer to this one would depend on are you doing a random idealized experiment or did you select a group of girls for your comparison group,

117
00:23:32,100 --> 00:23:33,330
for your non exposure group?

118
00:23:41,430 --> 00:23:49,140
So then for F, how would you expect it express exchange ability between the two groups using the notation we learned in class?

119
00:23:49,710 --> 00:24:16,870
I think it's easier if I just write it. Yes.

120
00:24:34,950 --> 00:24:53,860
It's. No.

121
00:25:11,410 --> 00:25:15,010
So these equations should also be in your slides.

122
00:25:15,400 --> 00:25:21,910
So the first two are specific cases of exposure, not exposure.

123
00:25:21,940 --> 00:25:26,410
And then the third one is a more generic form of exchange ability.

124
00:25:27,190 --> 00:25:34,780
So it's saying in the first line the probability of the marginal counterfactual among the exposed.

125
00:25:34,930 --> 00:25:44,650
So this is thinking whole population. Since you're thinking marginal, counterfactual is equal to the probability of the outcome in the exposed.

126
00:25:45,130 --> 00:25:47,740
Had they been exposed in real life,

127
00:25:48,490 --> 00:25:59,860
that proportion has to also be equal to the counterfactual outcome among those who were not exposed in real life had they been exposed.

128
00:26:00,460 --> 00:26:11,290
So the whole concept of exchange ability is if you were to expose, like if you had your unexposed group and you were to expose them,

129
00:26:11,770 --> 00:26:20,020
the same proportion of people who developed the outcome should be the same among those who are actually exposed in real life.

130
00:26:22,520 --> 00:26:26,990
So. It's.

131
00:26:30,700 --> 00:26:34,750
Yeah. So what have. And so.

132
00:26:40,200 --> 00:26:47,280
Yes. So that is saying they are exchangeable. If you want to show it's not exchangeable just not equal sign would be.

133
00:26:49,190 --> 00:27:01,470
So then if you are giving like data for that, you have to show the marginal counterfactual under the exposure is equal to that counterfactual.

134
00:27:01,490 --> 00:27:06,950
Had they been exposed in both those who are exposed in real life and those who were exposed in real life?

135
00:27:09,810 --> 00:27:14,740
And that holds again for if both groups had not been exposed.

136
00:27:14,760 --> 00:27:22,890
So that's that second line. Are there any other questions about exchange ability?

137
00:27:25,360 --> 00:27:35,229
So we're. You can you can probably just write the last one.

138
00:27:35,230 --> 00:27:41,110
I just wrote all of them just so you can kind of see it better.

139
00:27:41,470 --> 00:27:56,440
The exchange ability concepts. Yeah. So then four part G.

140
00:27:56,920 --> 00:28:01,060
Would you expect that the two groups would be exchangeable at the time the girls were born?

141
00:28:01,510 --> 00:28:04,690
Why or why not? Does anyone have any ideas?

142
00:28:20,390 --> 00:28:29,810
Synthetic genetics. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

143
00:28:30,290 --> 00:28:32,540
So that's precisely right. So yeah,

144
00:28:32,540 --> 00:28:41,780
there could be differences in the characteristics of the two groups before the exposure ever occurred that could make the two groups not exchangeable.

145
00:28:42,740 --> 00:28:48,920
And then if we're going back also to the ideal randomized experiment, you still would have exchange ability in that case,

146
00:28:49,580 --> 00:28:55,450
since all the characteristics between the two groups should be equally distributed between the two groups.

147
00:28:55,460 --> 00:28:58,990
If you were to randomly assign exposure or not exposure.

148
00:29:01,610 --> 00:29:05,060
Does anyone have any questions on the first part before we move on to the second?

149
00:29:10,490 --> 00:29:10,940
Yeah.

150
00:29:11,180 --> 00:29:23,840
So it's saying the probability of the marginal counterfactual so that there's kind of like that implied y equals one, y equals zero in each case.

151
00:29:24,410 --> 00:29:29,060
So whatever their exposure is, that's that a.

152
00:29:30,600 --> 00:29:38,160
Has to be the same. Equal to the probability of the counterfactual outcome under that same exposure.

153
00:29:38,700 --> 00:29:42,210
Independent of what their actual exposure is in real life.

154
00:29:42,990 --> 00:29:50,880
So when you're looking at the second part, like the large A, if you're looking at the first two lines equals one equals zero.

155
00:29:51,390 --> 00:29:59,250
Those are their real life exposures. So if two groups are truly exchangeable, it shouldn't matter what.

156
00:30:00,510 --> 00:30:10,080
Their exposure is in real life. If either group is exposed, they should get the same proportion of the outcome because they are exchangeable.

157
00:30:13,820 --> 00:30:22,090
Jason. Yeah. I didn't see.

158
00:30:23,680 --> 00:30:27,259
And yeah, yeah, in this case, they're not exchangeable.

159
00:30:27,260 --> 00:30:31,730
So those things would not be equal. But if they were exchangeable, they'd be equal.

160
00:30:38,930 --> 00:30:43,760
If there are any other questions on the first part, you can start working on the second part.

161
00:30:44,270 --> 00:30:47,690
We'll do about 10 minutes and then we'll go over the answers to part two.

162
00:30:52,580 --> 00:31:00,290
It's. During.

163
00:31:05,040 --> 00:31:18,790
I just couldn't read the board. Oh, okay. I mean.

164
00:31:38,070 --> 00:31:44,600
I thought.

165
00:31:47,780 --> 00:31:55,520
I guess. However.

166
00:32:14,400 --> 00:32:17,730
And then I think as I get.

167
00:33:10,400 --> 00:33:15,790
But. I know.

168
00:33:25,590 --> 00:33:37,600
Well. And I think it would just be.

169
00:33:39,810 --> 00:33:48,480
Yeah. So you actually like samples so you can say.

170
00:33:49,950 --> 00:33:55,700
Yeah. And then you'd also like to know that you.

171
00:33:58,970 --> 00:34:02,360
In this case, probation, enforcement, all.

172
00:34:05,630 --> 00:34:16,250
And you're playing golf and you don't know.

173
00:34:18,790 --> 00:34:41,030
Yeah. I never.

174
00:34:49,220 --> 00:34:54,530
Yes. I.

175
00:35:11,760 --> 00:35:25,660
Yeah. Yeah.

176
00:35:30,850 --> 00:35:54,270
Oh, yeah. I think you may have.

177
00:36:11,400 --> 00:36:27,540
Gas. I'll be right.

178
00:36:43,860 --> 00:37:05,720
I know. Why?

179
00:37:08,760 --> 00:37:45,400
So. Yeah, I mean. So is got.

180
00:38:00,650 --> 00:38:08,450
You. As part.

181
00:38:23,020 --> 00:38:26,070
Okay. So it's not.

182
00:38:36,950 --> 00:38:48,490
Well, yeah. Yes, there's a lot of.

183
00:39:02,260 --> 00:39:07,060
And in the interest of time, I think we're going to start going over a part to.

184
00:39:13,970 --> 00:39:19,280
We're going to we're going to start going over part two just so we can get through the answers before our class ends.

185
00:39:21,430 --> 00:39:27,060
So so for part two, you actually have to do the calculations.

186
00:39:27,080 --> 00:39:32,540
So it says investigators compared the group of 500 girls with early menarche.

187
00:39:32,840 --> 00:39:41,660
Those are exposed, 50 of whom developed breast cancer with a group of 4500 girls without early menarche.

188
00:39:42,260 --> 00:39:46,340
Those are your unexposed, 90 of whom develop breast cancer.

189
00:39:46,880 --> 00:39:53,600
And then he tells you, had both groups combine experience, early menarche, 600 would have developed breast cancer,

190
00:39:53,930 --> 00:39:58,550
whereas had they not experience early menarche, 50 would have developed breast cancer.

191
00:39:59,120 --> 00:40:05,270
So for part age, it says, is there an association between early menarche and the development of breast cancer?

192
00:40:05,660 --> 00:40:08,660
Use notation and calculations and justify your answer.

193
00:40:09,470 --> 00:40:17,300
So when you're looking at if you have an association or not, you're looking at the real life outcomes and exposures.

194
00:40:17,420 --> 00:40:24,680
So you're going to compare the proportion of those among the exposed who developed the outcome

195
00:40:25,490 --> 00:40:30,950
and compare that with the proportion of those in the unexposed who developed the outcome.

196
00:40:31,400 --> 00:40:45,400
So in terms of notation, that would be. The probability of your outcome.

197
00:40:49,330 --> 00:40:56,770
Given they were exposed in real life and see if that is or isn't equal.

198
00:40:59,370 --> 00:41:04,880
To. The probability.

199
00:41:08,290 --> 00:41:12,220
Of the outcome in those who were unexposed.

200
00:41:13,470 --> 00:41:14,190
In real life.

201
00:41:14,340 --> 00:41:28,410
So if you go back to what he tells you, he tells you that 50 of those 50 of the girls developed breast cancer among the 500 who were exposed.

202
00:41:29,040 --> 00:41:32,820
So your first one will be 50.

203
00:41:34,480 --> 00:41:39,700
Divided by 500. And then he tells you 90.

204
00:41:40,980 --> 00:41:45,990
Girls developed breast cancer among those who were unexposed, the 4500 girls.

205
00:41:46,650 --> 00:41:51,480
So that proportion would be 90 divided by 4500.

206
00:41:52,110 --> 00:41:59,190
And so then to determine if you had an association or not, you're going to compare those probabilities.

207
00:41:59,310 --> 00:42:02,700
If they're not equal, then you have an association.

208
00:42:03,090 --> 00:42:11,580
You know that the probability of the outcome is going to be different depending on if or if they did or didn't have the exposure.

209
00:42:12,450 --> 00:42:16,260
So in this case, they're not equal. So there is an association.

210
00:42:20,230 --> 00:42:23,880
You know, she's. Uh, just.

211
00:42:25,310 --> 00:42:35,390
So yeah, just do the probability of y equals one given a equals one does not equal the probability of y equals one given a equals zero.

212
00:42:38,340 --> 00:42:44,820
Sorry about it. Yeah, it's awesome about how do you how do you improve the situation?

213
00:42:45,810 --> 00:42:49,460
Why do you have a situation? Well from where you are.

214
00:42:50,190 --> 00:42:55,200
Yeah. So from where you are not right now, you can't determine if you have causation or not.

215
00:42:55,200 --> 00:42:58,649
Just by looking at those real life outcomes.

216
00:42:58,650 --> 00:43:06,870
You can only determine if there's an association that kind of ties in to the next question where it asks, is there a causal effect?

217
00:43:07,350 --> 00:43:10,500
And in order to determine if you have a causal effect or not,

218
00:43:10,920 --> 00:43:16,410
you have to look at are the marginal counterfactual outcomes different under the two exposures?

219
00:43:17,570 --> 00:43:27,510
So then that kind of goes into. Be you want to see is the probability of.

220
00:43:30,330 --> 00:43:41,400
The counterfactual outcome among. Those exposed equal to the counterfactual outcome.

221
00:43:42,900 --> 00:44:00,480
Among those not exposed. So then he tells you that had they not had both groups combined experience early menarche.

222
00:44:00,750 --> 00:44:03,220
So you know you're looking at total populations.

223
00:44:03,240 --> 00:44:09,060
So those are your marginal probabilities, which is what you need to determine if you have a causal effect or not.

224
00:44:09,600 --> 00:44:15,300
And so he says, um, the probability.

225
00:44:18,510 --> 00:44:22,970
Had everyone been exposed. Is.

226
00:44:25,360 --> 00:44:29,320
600. Out of that total, 500 girls.

227
00:44:30,220 --> 00:44:34,990
And he tells you, had everyone not been exposed.

228
00:44:42,600 --> 00:44:46,430
90 would have developed breast cancer. Out of the.

229
00:44:48,130 --> 00:44:57,020
Sorry. I was looking at the wrong 150. Another 5000 would have developed breast cancer.

230
00:44:57,320 --> 00:45:05,390
So then in order to determine if you have a causal effect or not, you're going to compare those two marginal counterfactual outcomes.

231
00:45:05,570 --> 00:45:08,570
And since they're not different, you're going to have a causal effect.

232
00:45:12,910 --> 00:45:20,830
Where do I get the 5000 from? So when you're looking at causal effects, you're looking at marginal probabilities.

233
00:45:20,830 --> 00:45:27,670
And those are. What is the proportion who developed the outcome out of the total population?

234
00:45:28,090 --> 00:45:33,070
So he tells you in the exposed group, the original exposure group, there's 500.

235
00:45:33,670 --> 00:45:36,820
In the original unexposed group there's 4500.

236
00:45:36,880 --> 00:45:43,420
So it's just the 4500 plus the 500 because he's saying had both groups come by and been exposed.

237
00:45:43,750 --> 00:45:47,260
So you're just going to add the total amount of people for both groups.

238
00:45:53,020 --> 00:46:05,630
Is there any other questions on this one? So you're going to compare the outcomes to each other.

239
00:46:06,170 --> 00:46:11,059
Is the probability of outcome among everyone?

240
00:46:11,060 --> 00:46:17,030
Had they been exposed equal to the probability of that outcome?

241
00:46:17,450 --> 00:46:22,280
Have they not been exposed? So if they're not equal, you have a causal effect.

242
00:46:22,490 --> 00:46:44,250
If they are equal, you don't have a causal effect. So then for part, Jay, it says assuming consistency.

243
00:46:44,640 --> 00:46:50,760
Do you have any differences in observed outcomes between the groups that experience each level of exposure in real life,

244
00:46:52,020 --> 00:46:56,999
or do any differences in observed outcomes between the groups that experience each level?

245
00:46:57,000 --> 00:47:00,150
Exposure in real life have a causal interpretation.

246
00:47:00,660 --> 00:47:07,830
So in order to say something really does have a causal effect, you have to have exchange ability between those two groups.

247
00:47:08,490 --> 00:47:14,280
You can't definitively say you have a causal effect if your two groups aren't actually exchangeable.

248
00:47:14,940 --> 00:47:20,370
So in this case, you then have to test that those groups in this case are actually exchangeable.

249
00:47:21,390 --> 00:47:34,570
So. If we look at our definitions of exchange ability over there, we have to test is that marginal counterfactual.

250
00:47:35,290 --> 00:47:46,090
Had everyone been exposed equal to the probability of the counterfactual and exposed among those who are actually exposed are those equal.

251
00:47:46,810 --> 00:47:52,610
And so I think it's easier to write it. So. You stay.

252
00:47:53,630 --> 00:48:03,030
So we're looking at just the first one. We have already determined what this is in the previous question.

253
00:48:03,970 --> 00:48:08,920
So that's. The. 600.

254
00:48:10,340 --> 00:48:13,880
Over 5000. Then we have to determine.

255
00:48:14,700 --> 00:48:22,250
But at least one of the keys are. So in this case, we can determine what physical consistency.

256
00:48:22,580 --> 00:48:25,700
Because through consistency, this probability.

257
00:48:26,790 --> 00:48:33,550
Why? But the counterfactual among those who would actually be exposing their people.

258
00:48:36,510 --> 00:48:41,430
Q What they actually exposed, what they actually experienced in real life.

259
00:48:43,190 --> 00:48:54,680
Because in order for everything to be consistent, what the girls had experienced with the girls was being exposed in real life.

260
00:48:55,520 --> 00:49:00,470
They're all trying to be equal to what absolute outcome is for them.

261
00:49:00,620 --> 00:49:05,020
And even. So we know in that case that's.

262
00:49:09,010 --> 00:49:13,830
It's. Over 500. For this piece here.

263
00:49:14,280 --> 00:49:18,890
We don't actually know. What that is.

264
00:49:19,370 --> 00:49:29,210
So in this case, we're just going to come here. You see, it's the 600 divided by 5000 people to the 50 divided by 500.

265
00:49:29,600 --> 00:49:32,800
So we know in this case, in the high school, it's been very difficult.

266
00:49:34,450 --> 00:49:41,690
But also if you're looking at. I'm else.

267
00:49:42,850 --> 00:49:50,790
We're looking at sustainability in that case. Again with consistency.

268
00:49:51,240 --> 00:49:59,180
We know this, these people. We probably will end up with among those who are not exposed in real life.

269
00:50:00,720 --> 00:50:04,680
So, you know. In that case. That's.

270
00:50:07,680 --> 00:50:14,100
Yeah. 19. We're offering 500.

271
00:50:15,060 --> 00:50:19,620
And we determined this in the previous questions equal to the 50.

272
00:50:23,720 --> 00:50:28,820
5000 again aren't equal. So, you know, having seen reality.

273
00:50:40,220 --> 00:50:54,740
Yeah, I. Any last minute.

274
00:51:18,630 --> 00:51:50,420
Yeah, I think. Yeah.

275
00:52:30,580 --> 00:53:02,530
That's all I was. Everything.

276
00:53:23,970 --> 00:53:35,500
Well. This black market.

277
00:53:55,480 --> 00:54:04,120
So I was there. It's my third year.

278
00:54:15,710 --> 00:54:29,530
I know. Yeah.

279
00:54:48,670 --> 00:55:04,140
I know. I know.

280
00:55:13,850 --> 00:55:27,770
I know that. Know we already.

281
00:55:38,890 --> 00:56:20,750
And I feel like. Voters are looking for a way to define the reality.

282
00:56:29,310 --> 00:56:45,050
So here we are.

283
00:56:48,820 --> 00:57:08,920
I think that's what he wants to know.

284
00:57:09,290 --> 00:57:21,070
Yeah, yeah, yeah, right, right.

285
00:57:27,970 --> 00:57:41,140
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

286
00:57:44,090 --> 00:57:52,450
Yeah. Oh, yeah, yeah.

287
00:57:54,350 --> 00:57:59,170
So you just.

288
00:57:59,190 --> 00:58:04,690
You know, you have to do it, I think.

289
00:58:08,900 --> 00:58:14,180
