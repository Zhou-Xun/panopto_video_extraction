1
00:00:00,813 --> 00:00:03,873
Okay. So as you realize, we do not have a screen anymore.

2
00:00:04,203 --> 00:00:08,723
So the twins were damaged and so they are on backorder for 4 to 6 weeks.

3
00:00:08,733 --> 00:00:14,763
It may take some time. So we're going to be using the whiteboard as a screen if you have trouble seeing, just scootch up to the front.

4
00:00:15,663 --> 00:00:18,153
But that is going to be the way it's going to be for a little bit.

5
00:00:19,233 --> 00:00:30,453
So I am very, very pleased that we have a very special guest speaker today to talk about health and aging related policy.

6
00:00:31,563 --> 00:00:41,073
Dr. Robin Montell is a colleague of mine. We are copies of a large grant looking at aging and disability as we've worked together for many years.

7
00:00:41,073 --> 00:00:47,043
And she does amazing work, I think a section of the policy in health and aging.

8
00:00:47,763 --> 00:00:51,603
So she kindly agreed to come and share her wisdom with you today.

9
00:00:52,113 --> 00:00:58,083
And I will let you then go over to briefly introduce yourself and tell us how you got where you are.

10
00:00:58,173 --> 00:01:01,233
Thank you so much, PHILIPPa. I'm honored to be here.

11
00:01:01,233 --> 00:01:08,042
It's it's a pleasure to try to pass on some of my knowledge and share information with you.

12
00:01:08,043 --> 00:01:13,022
And also, I always find that I learn from students as much as they learn from me.

13
00:01:13,023 --> 00:01:18,483
So I appreciate that. Yeah. As PHILIPPa mentioned, we've been working together on this grant.

14
00:01:19,563 --> 00:01:27,723
I also have connections back with the School of Public Health because I'm a graduate of the school back in the early eighties, I date myself.

15
00:01:29,733 --> 00:01:34,623
It was actually a program that doesn't exist anymore.

16
00:01:35,403 --> 00:01:41,643
It was a health health planning and policy program that got merged into hospital administration.

17
00:01:41,793 --> 00:01:49,413
Oh, okay. So it's it's interesting, but I'm still going to do it.

18
00:01:51,663 --> 00:01:55,712
There was a focus on planning back then because of all the sticker need,

19
00:01:55,713 --> 00:02:00,243
laws and changes were occurring at the federal level focusing on health planning.

20
00:02:01,203 --> 00:02:08,223
So that was the the emphasis, but it was really multi-disciplinary and it was a very worthwhile degree to have.

21
00:02:08,433 --> 00:02:13,143
I also got a secondary degree in gerontology because already back then it was an interest of mine.

22
00:02:14,643 --> 00:02:19,353
Much later I got a subsequent law degree from Wayne.

23
00:02:19,773 --> 00:02:25,352
I went to Wayne State for that while I was working at Blue Cross and my career has

24
00:02:25,353 --> 00:02:32,523
been really circuitous because a lot of it had to do with what jobs were available.

25
00:02:32,763 --> 00:02:39,363
When I graduated, I was very interested in community, neighborhood health centers and other types of things,

26
00:02:39,363 --> 00:02:43,143
but there were no jobs there because it was a recession at that point.

27
00:02:43,923 --> 00:02:53,163
So I got a hospital planning job and from there I went into quality and evaluation.

28
00:02:53,883 --> 00:03:02,403
A lot of data analysis and related work moved into consulting here with a company that you probably know is true,

29
00:03:02,403 --> 00:03:06,873
then used to be called Met Stat and worked there for a number of years,

30
00:03:08,163 --> 00:03:12,843
then moved to Blue Cross for about 15 years in Detroit,

31
00:03:13,263 --> 00:03:20,223
where I was responsible for proper evaluation provider performance measurement, among many other things.

32
00:03:20,913 --> 00:03:29,072
But all in the data analytics space began to tie in some of the privacy related

33
00:03:29,073 --> 00:03:34,682
policy as I got my law degree and looking at data security and privacy.

34
00:03:34,683 --> 00:03:36,513
So I have a lot of knowledge there as well.

35
00:03:37,503 --> 00:03:51,543
Then when I had the opportunity, I moved to church, as we call it, which is a I like to think of it as a think tank within the university family.

36
00:03:52,503 --> 00:03:57,413
Church started with that.

37
00:03:57,783 --> 00:04:05,073
It was a bit I won't go into all the history, but it was basically a joint program or joint venture between University of Michigan and Blue

38
00:04:05,073 --> 00:04:15,452
Cross Blue Shield of Michigan and a nonprofit focused on health policy with a nonpartizan lens,

39
00:04:15,453 --> 00:04:24,932
really trying to look at the evidence and the data to inform policymakers and also to help decision makers with consulting and other types of work.

40
00:04:24,933 --> 00:04:31,593
And then we dabble in areas of interest like disability policy as well as other things.

41
00:04:31,893 --> 00:04:35,433
You know, I focused a lot on the aging space.

42
00:04:36,003 --> 00:04:39,663
We have a large contract with the state of Michigan to help them with their Medicaid program.

43
00:04:40,063 --> 00:04:48,733
I'll get into a few details about that as I talk. And then, of course, the purchasing focus on healthy aging for individuals with disability.

44
00:04:50,473 --> 00:04:54,553
I want to get into the slides rather than just talk about myself.

45
00:04:56,653 --> 00:05:02,893
And let me just briefly touch on what I see as our learning objectives.

46
00:05:03,133 --> 00:05:11,623
And I want to just start by saying that health care policies, as I'm sure you're aware, really support public health.

47
00:05:12,703 --> 00:05:19,273
And they also hopefully improve the lives of of people in very specific population segments.

48
00:05:20,263 --> 00:05:23,233
But policy is very, very messy.

49
00:05:23,833 --> 00:05:31,753
You'd like to think of the perfect policy process as being evidence based and, you know, dialog between stakeholders and policymakers.

50
00:05:32,053 --> 00:05:39,853
But it's often special interest advocacy decisions made, not necessarily with evidence.

51
00:05:40,903 --> 00:05:47,623
So I'm going to show a little bit of both. There's a process that is more ideal and then what really happens?

52
00:05:49,213 --> 00:05:52,573
But I think it's important to understand a little bit of both.

53
00:05:53,203 --> 00:05:57,733
I have some examples that I'm going to talk about very briefly.

54
00:05:58,183 --> 00:06:04,303
The ACA coverage of preventive services and Medicaid, home and community based services,

55
00:06:04,723 --> 00:06:11,203
which I know you've touched on a little bit with the waiver programs. And then I'm going to focus a little more in depth on caregiver support.

56
00:06:12,073 --> 00:06:21,252
And then I'm going to pivot and talk about policy briefs and how they're developed and how you target them to the audience.

57
00:06:21,253 --> 00:06:37,123
That can be decision makers. The CDC policy is a very formal, well-researched, defined policy approach that I just wanted to highlight,

58
00:06:37,123 --> 00:06:45,373
because this is this is what people think of as the more ideal process oriented policy development approach.

59
00:06:45,373 --> 00:06:55,303
It sometimes occurs. But, you know, often there are bumps along the road, starting with problem identification where issues are apparent.

60
00:06:55,963 --> 00:07:00,433
There's research and evidence underlying them. There are clear gaps in care.

61
00:07:01,333 --> 00:07:06,373
Moving on to a policy analysis, this is when you get into the cost benefit analysis,

62
00:07:06,423 --> 00:07:12,163
you've probably learned and perhaps performed where you're really looking for,

63
00:07:12,463 --> 00:07:21,613
again, the documentation to support different options and and the weighing of different options for potential policy solutions.

64
00:07:22,783 --> 00:07:31,633
Then the strategy in policy development, this is where ideally stakeholders get involved and you pull in all the different interests you listen.

65
00:07:32,293 --> 00:07:42,313
We work the policy solutions and really look at the impact of policy changes on those stakeholders.

66
00:07:42,913 --> 00:07:50,803
And then policy enactment. This is actually the procedural process of getting policies approved,

67
00:07:51,223 --> 00:08:00,793
getting them either legislated or if it's more local, the other types of steps that occur at the local or state level.

68
00:08:01,423 --> 00:08:07,723
And then finally, implementation. And that's really the nuts and bolts of translating it into operations.

69
00:08:11,113 --> 00:08:18,583
I also wanted to highlight several state approaches that have been taken by only a handful of states,

70
00:08:19,663 --> 00:08:25,003
and I've highlighted California because I think there's this most comprehensively developed.

71
00:08:25,213 --> 00:08:31,963
Massachusetts has a really comprehensive one as well, and these states have developed master plans for aging.

72
00:08:34,123 --> 00:08:44,983
And the impetus for development actually came either from the governor's office or the legislature to require,

73
00:08:44,983 --> 00:08:51,613
in the case of California, require that the state create a master plan by a certain date.

74
00:08:52,333 --> 00:09:04,303
And then they pulled together all the respective stakeholders and engaged in a very complicated, time consuming process over several years.

75
00:09:04,993 --> 00:09:06,803
They now have a master plan for aging.

76
00:09:07,663 --> 00:09:14,113
They've been able to implement some legislation that has been driven by the recommendations for this master plan.

77
00:09:14,923 --> 00:09:17,133
Not everything, just parts of it.

78
00:09:17,153 --> 00:09:26,593
I think it's probably always going to be in progress and it's really focused on the concept of having an age friendly in this case state.

79
00:09:27,193 --> 00:09:31,213
There are other communities where they have age friendly cities,

80
00:09:32,053 --> 00:09:37,723
but California is actually trying to build an aged friendly state, which is which is really fascinating.

81
00:09:37,843 --> 00:09:43,453
And I've given you a link and reference to look at that.

82
00:09:43,813 --> 00:09:51,012
That is amazing that they're doing that. I know all the goals and like housing and health and inclusion and sort of getting

83
00:09:51,013 --> 00:09:54,163
out all the things that we've been talking about in this class that's relevant,

84
00:09:54,283 --> 00:10:04,932
you know, for aging. Yeah. I mean, it's really kind of the gold standard of what one might look for, but it's resource intensive,

85
00:10:04,933 --> 00:10:10,933
time intensive, and it really takes top leadership commitment to do this sort of thing.

86
00:10:12,433 --> 00:10:15,643
So that's why you only see it being done in four states.

87
00:10:16,153 --> 00:10:20,353
I couldn't find any other states that are going down this path at this point,

88
00:10:21,463 --> 00:10:27,733
but I thought this would be worthwhile highlighting and if you want to learn more about it, certainly delve into the details.

89
00:10:28,723 --> 00:10:33,643
But it's it's very progressive and an interesting enough.

90
00:10:33,643 --> 00:10:37,903
I mean, it's a diverse array of states doing it in Killeen, Texas.

91
00:10:38,413 --> 00:10:46,023
And, you know, Texas has actually been one of the more progressive states for Medicaid and, you know,

92
00:10:46,063 --> 00:10:57,253
some of the aging related policies like this, because they have such a large, large population of people aging and moving to the state.

93
00:10:58,093 --> 00:11:03,493
Now they have some practices that are not necessarily consumer friendly.

94
00:11:03,493 --> 00:11:20,083
Like we learned, for example, that they no longer have the office that provides support for people trying to navigate the system.

95
00:11:21,103 --> 00:11:29,503
They removed funding for that, but they do have very strong programs for home and community based services and other things like that.

96
00:11:30,103 --> 00:11:35,683
And a lot of it's the dollars and cents you look at the cost benefit return on investment,

97
00:11:36,493 --> 00:11:39,133
moving away from institutional care makes a huge difference.

98
00:11:39,583 --> 00:11:47,653
So I think, you know, it's driven by different triggers for these states, but the financial aspect is a real key.

99
00:11:47,653 --> 00:11:55,153
And you have to keep that in mind when you're talking to policymakers to figure out what it is that's going to motivate them.

100
00:11:56,203 --> 00:12:02,743
And you have to have your own ideas about what the policy changes would be that would be most effective.

101
00:12:03,193 --> 00:12:07,603
But you then have to speak the language, who whoever is going to actually be able to act on it.

102
00:12:11,263 --> 00:12:14,443
Want to start with an example.

103
00:12:15,433 --> 00:12:18,043
You're all probably very familiar with the ACA.

104
00:12:18,433 --> 00:12:26,533
The fact that the preventive services component now gives everyone essentially free preventive services who has insurance.

105
00:12:28,093 --> 00:12:35,023
And significantly has increased the access that some of the back story of this is that preventive services for

106
00:12:35,023 --> 00:12:43,453
a very long time have been promoted and pushed by a number of different organizations and advocacy groups,

107
00:12:43,933 --> 00:12:54,973
including physicians and organizations, that of various medical groups.

108
00:12:56,143 --> 00:13:01,373
But it never coalesced into policy other than guidelines.

109
00:13:02,413 --> 00:13:09,823
The ACA provided the opportunity to put this into law in a way that could really change access.

110
00:13:11,053 --> 00:13:21,703
So these organizations actually came together to share information about the various preventive services that might be in this mix.

111
00:13:22,273 --> 00:13:29,833
And there's a long list of them. And I wasn't in the room or anything, but I'm sure there was a huge debate about including this, including that.

112
00:13:30,943 --> 00:13:40,693
But we now have a very lengthy list of preventive services that we all have access to, with with no co-pays.

113
00:13:41,713 --> 00:13:49,903
So this is actually, I think, a good example of how policy changes can put something in place that's very beneficial.

114
00:13:53,193 --> 00:13:57,383
And I add here that there continue to be disparities in access.

115
00:13:57,393 --> 00:14:01,503
We've studied this as part of the RTC that I mentioned.

116
00:14:01,883 --> 00:14:14,553
And, you know, my research has looked at these disparities as it relates to preventive services in the various insurance groups.

117
00:14:15,123 --> 00:14:17,373
And for people with disabilities,

118
00:14:18,333 --> 00:14:26,463
the rate at which they receive some of these preventive services is lower than the general population because they still have access issues.

119
00:14:27,183 --> 00:14:33,603
So it's not generalizable. There are still areas that could be improved.

120
00:14:37,333 --> 00:14:41,143
My next example has to do with home and community based services.

121
00:14:41,333 --> 00:14:46,933
CBS And this relates to the waiver programs that you have learned a little bit about.

122
00:14:47,863 --> 00:14:59,773
But I wanted to share this slide because I think this visually illustrates how policy changes over time can really result in fairly dramatic changes.

123
00:15:00,193 --> 00:15:08,022
Now, I can't attribute all of this change to the policy changes because there's also the factor of consumer choice.

124
00:15:08,023 --> 00:15:14,503
And people increasingly want to stay in their homes versus a nursing home, which is most of what this represents.

125
00:15:16,183 --> 00:15:24,403
But until the services in the home were available and supported financially, it was very difficult for people to make that choice.

126
00:15:25,153 --> 00:15:30,133
So over the course of this slide represents 95 to 2019.

127
00:15:32,803 --> 00:15:35,533
And this is large this is Medicaid that we're looking at here.

128
00:15:38,083 --> 00:15:46,633
State Medicaid programs increasingly started adding benefits that would allow people to stay in the home,

129
00:15:46,873 --> 00:15:56,893
taking advantage of waiver programs that provided federal dollars to their state, match money to support people stay in their homes.

130
00:15:57,283 --> 00:16:05,053
And there were a number of initiatives to test different approaches to see what would work again,

131
00:16:06,973 --> 00:16:13,363
triggered by the federal changes and the programs that states could choose to participate in or not.

132
00:16:14,503 --> 00:16:25,033
And then the matching or partially matching state moneys with the whole idea of staying within the Medicaid budget.

133
00:16:25,483 --> 00:16:31,663
So these were services to bring the cost down, not to increase Medicaid spending,

134
00:16:31,873 --> 00:16:35,473
but to shift it between institutional and home and community based services.

135
00:16:35,923 --> 00:16:40,183
And you can see how effective it was. It's continuing to increase.

136
00:16:40,543 --> 00:16:50,293
And there's some current federal policy that I mentioned in my introduction that's focused on dual eligible Medicare and Medicaid individuals,

137
00:16:50,773 --> 00:16:54,463
where the integration of the care has been very,

138
00:16:54,463 --> 00:17:01,063
very difficult, both for the beneficiary and for the providers,

139
00:17:01,423 --> 00:17:10,813
as well as for the state to deal with different mechanisms between the two programs and coverage issues.

140
00:17:11,233 --> 00:17:22,483
So they're now moving after several of the waiver programs that were focused on duals are now being moved into a permanent program.

141
00:17:23,593 --> 00:17:32,473
Taking advantage of this nips the dual special need plans that are part of the Medicare Advantage umbrella.

142
00:17:33,103 --> 00:17:34,842
I'm not going to get into the details of it,

143
00:17:34,843 --> 00:17:42,403
but I just want to flag that as one of the next major changes that's occurring in landscape that's going to impact duals,

144
00:17:42,403 --> 00:17:52,063
which are the most vulnerable population, very high cost and often fall through the cracks in getting services between Medicaid and Medicare.

145
00:17:52,663 --> 00:17:58,783
This includes not just the elderly, but also individuals under 65 with disabilities.

146
00:17:59,383 --> 00:18:03,023
So it's both populations. That's the question.

147
00:18:03,083 --> 00:18:12,443
Yes. So these are we have to meet every criteria and cut off and a functional health cut off to be able to be eligible.

148
00:18:12,803 --> 00:18:21,533
Is that correct? It varies state by state. Medicaid policy is state driven, not federal driven.

149
00:18:22,253 --> 00:18:25,703
Well, with with. Yeah, there's there's a balance.

150
00:18:26,063 --> 00:18:36,323
But states have the opportunity to do more innovative programs, either through waivers or through some of their own initiatives.

151
00:18:37,493 --> 00:18:48,803
And this while this map or this slide represents the total U.S., if you look at state by state, it's it can be dramatically different.

152
00:18:49,283 --> 00:18:53,183
There are states that have done much more and states that have hardly done anything.

153
00:18:54,233 --> 00:18:58,973
So it really varies. And states have a choice about how they handle their Medicaid program.

154
00:18:59,303 --> 00:19:02,653
I mean, just. Yes.

155
00:19:02,683 --> 00:19:06,623
Why do you think so many people fall through the cracks if it's Medicaid and Medicare

156
00:19:06,623 --> 00:19:11,923
are both presumably being managed by the same like overarching they're not.

157
00:19:12,283 --> 00:19:15,763
That's the problem, I guess. Like the government, like the U.S. Medicare.

158
00:19:19,063 --> 00:19:27,253
Well, let's take an example of a state like Michigan, where Medicare can be fee for service.

159
00:19:27,973 --> 00:19:35,233
It can be through a medicare Advantage plan and it can be through some of the waiver programs like my health link,

160
00:19:35,803 --> 00:19:45,553
where health plans have been required to provide both the Medicare and Medicaid services so the individual,

161
00:19:45,703 --> 00:19:55,933
when they go to their provider, Medicare, is typically primary, Medicaid, secondary, and the billings are different.

162
00:19:56,773 --> 00:20:01,183
The providers don't always participate in Medicaid.

163
00:20:01,363 --> 00:20:06,913
So you may have to go to different providers or find one that participates with both, both programs.

164
00:20:08,563 --> 00:20:13,533
And if you go through an appeal, you have to go to different agencies for your appeals.

165
00:20:13,543 --> 00:20:14,922
I mean, those are just examples.

166
00:20:14,923 --> 00:20:26,143
There are many others, but it's very difficult for the individual without help to navigate that type of system and even eligibility,

167
00:20:26,393 --> 00:20:32,743
you know, a person will often have one or the other and not know that they're eligible for both.

168
00:20:33,853 --> 00:20:42,313
So there's an eligibility issue as well. What this is going to require is that the same health plan and that's going to be done through health plans.

169
00:20:42,853 --> 00:20:51,193
The same health plan has to offer both Medicare managed care and Medicaid managed care with the same provider network.

170
00:20:52,093 --> 00:20:55,843
So it's going and they have to have one card.

171
00:20:56,533 --> 00:21:02,713
It's as complicated as having your Medicaid card and your Medicare card and having

172
00:21:02,713 --> 00:21:09,672
to renew Medicaid annually or how often you need to and showing both cards.

173
00:21:09,673 --> 00:21:14,613
This is this combines it into one program and that's simplifying it.

174
00:21:14,623 --> 00:21:20,413
But just to give you a feel for how complicated it is for someone who is likely needing

175
00:21:20,413 --> 00:21:28,303
caregiver help in some cases to find out all this stuff because it's just not it's hard for me.

176
00:21:29,113 --> 00:21:35,803
And, you know, if I think about someone who has limitations, it's impossible.

177
00:21:36,453 --> 00:21:47,533
So that's an aspect as well. And there are navigators and ombudsman's offices and other places people can go if they know, but they often don't know.

178
00:21:50,143 --> 00:21:57,523
It just strikes me as just the difference from Canada, where you have just a single health insurance and it's just that's it.

179
00:21:57,673 --> 00:22:08,403
And you it's for life. And it's there's not this middle tier of all the bureaucracy that has to get funded to sort of manage all these different.

180
00:22:08,573 --> 00:22:18,123
Business. Yeah, we're a market driven health system which has been cobbled together in all sorts of ways.

181
00:22:18,133 --> 00:22:22,813
Don't get me started. That's another lecture. Yeah.

182
00:22:23,093 --> 00:22:32,733
And I. My biases will show. I want to focus in on some of the caregiver policy.

183
00:22:33,063 --> 00:22:37,353
I know that you've received a copy of our caregiver brief.

184
00:22:38,373 --> 00:22:48,823
There's a lot of policy discussions and other discussions about the need to.

185
00:22:48,933 --> 00:22:56,133
But I just wanted to start by highlighting some of the key areas of need.

186
00:22:56,133 --> 00:23:03,693
And, you know, this becomes personal as I want to make sure things are in place by the time I get there and I get there sooner than you do.

187
00:23:04,413 --> 00:23:13,533
So by 2050, there are going to only be three caregivers per every person, 80 or older,

188
00:23:14,283 --> 00:23:19,833
and contrast that with where it used to be in 2010 when there were seven.

189
00:23:21,153 --> 00:23:33,243
This means that it's going to be increasingly difficult for people to have family members who are able and willing to help them out and provide care.

190
00:23:34,893 --> 00:23:39,003
I've already talked about some of the policy trends shifting to CVS,

191
00:23:40,923 --> 00:23:50,433
and I think a lot of the current dialog around these changes has been driven by COVID and

192
00:23:51,003 --> 00:24:00,003
how much it highlighted the lack of both family caregivers and the direct care workforce.

193
00:24:01,233 --> 00:24:14,433
I mean, that's a workforce that is often paid minimum wage or less little respect, very hard work and exposure to infections and everything else.

194
00:24:15,663 --> 00:24:23,523
And there's not enough people willing to do that work today for all sorts of reasons.

195
00:24:23,703 --> 00:24:27,003
Plus, we're not bringing in the immigrants who used to do a lot of the care.

196
00:24:27,613 --> 00:24:33,413
And so there's a lot of reasons for it. And again, the workforce issues are huge.

197
00:24:33,423 --> 00:24:37,383
I'm not going to spend a whole lot of time on those, but that factors into this.

198
00:24:37,593 --> 00:24:44,823
This focuses on how to support family caregivers. But there's really both the paid workforce and the family caregiver workforce.

199
00:24:47,863 --> 00:24:54,133
This gets into some of the payment. Most of the care is family members volunteering to provide care.

200
00:24:55,153 --> 00:25:00,973
Medicaid is increasingly paying for aspects of caregiver support.

201
00:25:02,533 --> 00:25:11,953
Some Medicaid programs, such as in Michigan Home help actually pay a certain amount to the caregiver.

202
00:25:13,243 --> 00:25:17,953
If the in an individual beneficiary meets certain requirements.

203
00:25:18,643 --> 00:25:22,873
So there's a monetary payment. But that's not universal.

204
00:25:23,023 --> 00:25:28,363
And it's it's a pilot type program which which has been in place in Michigan.

205
00:25:28,513 --> 00:25:33,853
I don't know how many years, but it's it's a very well-respected program with waiting list, as you might imagine.

206
00:25:34,783 --> 00:25:40,543
Medicare has almost no caregiver support. The Veteran's Administration actually has the best.

207
00:25:41,263 --> 00:25:44,263
And if you qualify for veterans benefits.

208
00:25:47,083 --> 00:25:50,203
Actually, I have my notes here. Let me just touch on some of the specifics.

209
00:25:51,163 --> 00:26:00,193
If a veteran has service related, a service related condition, they're able to designate a primary caregiver.

210
00:26:00,673 --> 00:26:11,323
And that caregiver gets a monthly stipend, gets health care benefits, and gets training and education and mental health care.

211
00:26:12,703 --> 00:26:18,403
And it's a very well respected program, but it's for a small,

212
00:26:18,403 --> 00:26:27,673
small segment of veterans who have who meet nursing home eligibility requirements and have a service related condition.

213
00:26:29,203 --> 00:26:39,553
Other veterans can get their caregivers can get access to a lot of the educational support services, but not the monetary service support.

214
00:26:40,453 --> 00:26:43,883
So I just wanted to highlight that particular program. Yes.

215
00:26:43,903 --> 00:26:52,983
When we talk about caregivers, we're we're talking about paid professionals who are not related to the family in addition to family members.

216
00:26:53,623 --> 00:26:57,433
This is talking about family members. There are both.

217
00:26:58,123 --> 00:27:08,473
And, you know, the veterans program I mentioned, the Medicaid waiver program, Home Help, actually provides monetary stipends to family members.

218
00:27:08,743 --> 00:27:13,303
It's a very narrow list of family members. It has to be a spouse or a child.

219
00:27:14,113 --> 00:27:20,443
There may be one other category, but it doesn't extend to all relatives and it doesn't extend to a friend.

220
00:27:21,403 --> 00:27:27,283
So, you know, there are some limitations there, but, you know, there's some efforts to expand that eligibility.

221
00:27:32,213 --> 00:27:39,743
And I'm going to now walk through some examples of local initiatives, state initiatives and federal initiatives as it relates to caregivers.

222
00:27:41,333 --> 00:27:45,743
Because a lot of the most innovative ideas start out at the local level.

223
00:27:47,063 --> 00:27:50,753
And this is actually a way that ideas can be piloted,

224
00:27:51,353 --> 00:28:01,043
that people can get more directly involved in changing things within their community, and in some cases,

225
00:28:03,323 --> 00:28:10,883
advocating to state policymakers changes that have worked or programs that have worked at the local level that might be considered,

226
00:28:11,663 --> 00:28:19,133
for example, as a component of the Medicaid program. The first one I wanted to highlight was the capable program,

227
00:28:20,723 --> 00:28:26,063
and this is a program there's actually one operate in Ypsilanti that Ypsilanti

228
00:28:26,063 --> 00:28:33,263
Meals on Wheels has partnered with Johns Hopkins to offer this in Ypsi area.

229
00:28:34,043 --> 00:28:39,143
It got halted during COVID, but I think they're back up to doing a lot of the home renovations.

230
00:28:39,923 --> 00:28:46,103
And this is a partnership that has funding.

231
00:28:49,793 --> 00:28:54,533
The funding for capable is actually not taxpayer funding.

232
00:28:54,563 --> 00:29:02,903
This the funding is typically tied to grants and foundations.

233
00:29:02,903 --> 00:29:07,882
And in some cases, if there's a senior millage that that money's money goes into it.

234
00:29:07,883 --> 00:29:09,923
So it could be taxpayer from that perspective.

235
00:29:11,813 --> 00:29:19,763
And these programs pull together nurses, occupational therapists and handy people who come into the home,

236
00:29:20,003 --> 00:29:28,193
assess the needs that that person has to live in their home, put in ramps, crab bars, workout transportation.

237
00:29:29,663 --> 00:29:33,683
It's very targeted and it doesn't cover very many people.

238
00:29:34,043 --> 00:29:40,343
But for the people that get served by this program, they're often able to stay in their homes when they couldn't otherwise do so.

239
00:29:40,693 --> 00:29:44,543
Yeah, we talked about this a couple of weeks ago about this randomized controlled trial that was

240
00:29:44,543 --> 00:29:50,603
done to show the efficacy of this having Katie Marin 80 person come in and fix things.

241
00:29:50,893 --> 00:29:53,353
Yeah, that's tremendously important. Yeah.

242
00:29:53,363 --> 00:30:00,743
I mean, it might be that leaky roof that the person can't afford to repair that's going to put them in a nursing home and make them have to leave.

243
00:30:01,913 --> 00:30:05,033
It's not their health. It's it's the dwelling that they're in.

244
00:30:07,343 --> 00:30:16,703
Another example is senior villages. A number of counties within Michigan have senior villages, not Washtenaw County,

245
00:30:16,703 --> 00:30:22,043
which is curious, although there are some efforts to move this forward.

246
00:30:22,613 --> 00:30:33,283
And yeah, that that money is then used to fund programs for seniors within the community all over the map.

247
00:30:33,293 --> 00:30:37,702
You know, sometimes it's transportation, sometimes it's housing,

248
00:30:37,703 --> 00:30:43,283
all the social determinants of health that impact the individual's ability to stay in the community.

249
00:30:44,663 --> 00:30:49,203
Those are often administered through county commissions on aging councils, on aging.

250
00:30:50,783 --> 00:30:56,513
So I'm not going to get into the details there. At the state level.

251
00:30:58,733 --> 00:31:02,333
This is where the Medicaid waiver decision making occurs.

252
00:31:02,813 --> 00:31:09,892
States have to apply to the federal government to get a waiver and they go

253
00:31:09,893 --> 00:31:14,663
through a renewal process every two or three years for these waiver programs,

254
00:31:15,713 --> 00:31:19,493
and they have to determine what it is they're going to include within the waiver.

255
00:31:21,713 --> 00:31:31,673
And not every state does this. As I indicated, the ones I'm focusing on are tied to home and community based services with a caregiving component.

256
00:31:33,473 --> 00:31:46,252
And Michigan has several and the decent programs that I mentioned that are going to be transitioning all the way until 2025.

257
00:31:46,253 --> 00:31:50,513
So it's not 2025 until this change for integrated care is going to really come into play,

258
00:31:52,643 --> 00:31:56,663
were originally a waiver program and now they're going to become a permanent program.

259
00:31:57,203 --> 00:32:03,532
The Snoops and Medicare Advantage plans have the option to offer supplemental benefits within

260
00:32:03,533 --> 00:32:09,653
the capitated payment they have so they can choose what to offer and what not to offer.

261
00:32:10,343 --> 00:32:22,193
With some guidance from the state, the state can set contract requirements that can include certain programs or services that need to be offered.

262
00:32:22,193 --> 00:32:26,723
And so the state is going through a lot of early planning right now as to what that might look like.

263
00:32:28,283 --> 00:32:44,573
Are you familiar with the PACE program? PACE is a program which is a small program that is operating in many states, but not for all the population.

264
00:32:45,203 --> 00:32:47,723
That requires a nursing home level of care.

265
00:32:48,743 --> 00:33:01,973
It's typically duals that participate in pace and they offer respite care as well as all the bundled services for health and other social services.

266
00:33:02,303 --> 00:33:15,352
Within one program, people who sign up for pace have to make a decision to see PACE providers, so there's some restriction in what they can receive.

267
00:33:15,353 --> 00:33:22,582
But when they do make that choice, they get much of their care covered, including transportation,

268
00:33:22,583 --> 00:33:28,163
including being able to go to a respite facility for the caregiver, including caregiver support.

269
00:33:29,063 --> 00:33:33,173
So it's an extremely beneficial program to many of the people who participate.

270
00:33:34,793 --> 00:33:35,813
But as I indicated,

271
00:33:35,813 --> 00:33:45,862
it's very geographically limited and states have debated about whether to expand it or not because on the face of it, it's more costly.

272
00:33:45,863 --> 00:33:51,593
But the studies have showed that it's very cost effective at keeping people out of institutional care.

273
00:33:52,883 --> 00:33:56,723
What is respite care? Respite care is for the caregiver.

274
00:33:57,623 --> 00:34:08,033
It's it's in the case of pace, they often have a building where people go for day care,

275
00:34:08,213 --> 00:34:15,563
essentially, which provides the caregiver with a day off to do whatever they need to do.

276
00:34:16,283 --> 00:34:20,093
Or the person goes there every morning or every afternoon.

277
00:34:20,303 --> 00:34:25,553
It's that type of setting where Pace provides this to the participants.

278
00:34:28,163 --> 00:34:30,293
And it could be respite care, could be in the home.

279
00:34:30,753 --> 00:34:39,023
Know if I was caring for an elderly relative and needed a day off to do my own things, I would have someone come in and help with respite care.

280
00:34:41,513 --> 00:34:51,083
And then finally, the only state today that's actually implemented a long term care program is Washington state.

281
00:34:51,593 --> 00:34:59,363
And they have a payroll deduction program that any employer I believe it's so it's either other 20 or 50

282
00:34:59,873 --> 00:35:10,703
employees is required to add to the payroll a deduction that goes into this long term care trust fund.

283
00:35:11,483 --> 00:35:25,642
And it provides the individuals contributing a guaranteed $36,000 that can be used for long term care in the future.

284
00:35:25,643 --> 00:35:32,873
I think it's really incremented up and it's been very controversial, but they've implemented it.

285
00:35:33,233 --> 00:35:41,212
It's too early to tell how it's going to work, but it's it's one of the few programs that's been done at a state level to start building a

286
00:35:41,213 --> 00:35:52,193
fund that people can tap into and also have available for caregiver support or other things.

287
00:35:56,483 --> 00:36:03,023
And we've talked a bit about Medicaid waivers. Let me just see if there's anything here that I haven't highlighted.

288
00:36:06,713 --> 00:36:14,243
There are a few states that are using this to support unpaid caregivers through Medicaid, not very many.

289
00:36:16,343 --> 00:36:25,163
And it's primarily educational type services and support groups.

290
00:36:25,193 --> 00:36:32,213
It's not monetary support, except for the few programs like home health care in Michigan.

291
00:36:33,413 --> 00:36:42,263
So, you know, this this is a way that states have experimented with what might be done to cover services for family caregivers.

292
00:36:45,183 --> 00:36:52,723
At a national level. There are a number of initiatives that are being talked about.

293
00:36:52,743 --> 00:37:02,493
Nothing has really been implemented except the SNAP Medicare Advantage rule

294
00:37:02,493 --> 00:37:06,782
changes that are going into effect and those aren't requiring caregiver support.

295
00:37:06,783 --> 00:37:12,063
It's just a possibility as one of the supplemental benefits that can be included.

296
00:37:12,843 --> 00:37:19,443
But there are many other things to support people in the home. So it's it's multifaceted.

297
00:37:19,683 --> 00:37:26,193
Caregivers are supported in many different ways, and the people are supported and stay in their homes.

298
00:37:28,113 --> 00:37:39,363
There's been a there was an act referred to as raise, which is still underway to develop a national family caregiving strategy.

299
00:37:40,803 --> 00:37:47,793
I would suggest that you look on the Web to see all the various activities and publications.

300
00:37:48,153 --> 00:37:57,333
They've made recommendations. They've convened I think it's quarterly meetings that they have to pull in stakeholders and other experts.

301
00:37:58,593 --> 00:38:06,752
It's still a work in progress, and they are beginning to advocate for some of these other changes,

302
00:38:06,753 --> 00:38:15,903
like potentially expanding family medical leave or some changes that could go in effect with Social Security.

303
00:38:16,113 --> 00:38:20,343
So there's ideas out there, but nothing has yet been implemented through RES,

304
00:38:21,663 --> 00:38:36,093
but it's pulling all the parties together for a dialog which is often the start to policy making and then something catches light and moves forward.

305
00:38:38,163 --> 00:38:45,153
When you start talking about very specific conditions like Alzheimer's, there's sometimes more energy around it.

306
00:38:45,633 --> 00:38:53,823
And the Alzheimer's project goes way back to 2011 and they actually developed a national strategic plan.

307
00:38:54,693 --> 00:38:58,023
And again, this is not just focused on caregivers.

308
00:38:58,173 --> 00:39:03,123
It's focused on many aspects of the needs for people with Alzheimer's.

309
00:39:04,113 --> 00:39:14,123
But caregiving is one of those, and they've been the most active, I think, in actually triggering a lot of policy changes.

310
00:39:14,133 --> 00:39:17,582
I think I have a slide on that program.

311
00:39:17,583 --> 00:39:26,163
Yes. And then the older the American Older Americans Act has a national family caregiver support program.

312
00:39:26,163 --> 00:39:30,183
Much of their funding goes through the area agencies on aging,

313
00:39:30,993 --> 00:39:36,633
and the funding over time has declined or stayed the same, even though costs have increased.

314
00:39:37,083 --> 00:39:46,533
So this one could use additional funding. It's unlikely that that's going to happen because of all the other federal budgetary needs.

315
00:39:47,643 --> 00:39:49,863
And then there's been talk about whether, you know,

316
00:39:49,923 --> 00:39:55,413
whether there's a way to provide credits in Social Security for people who have to drop out of the workforce.

317
00:39:56,373 --> 00:40:04,473
Because to receive Social Security, when you reach eligible age, you have to have ten years of credits.

318
00:40:05,283 --> 00:40:15,153
And if someone drops out of the workforce and doesn't have all those credits and doesn't have a spouse that they can get the benefits from.

319
00:40:17,073 --> 00:40:19,503
There are people who don't qualify for Social Security,

320
00:40:20,073 --> 00:40:26,253
so that's a concern with people needing to provide this type of caregiving without having an income.

321
00:40:26,343 --> 00:40:29,433
What's a credit? What how do they define a credit?

322
00:40:29,963 --> 00:40:34,353
They're still defining what it would be like if you did caregiving for a year.

323
00:40:34,623 --> 00:40:38,673
You'd get some. It would be as if you worked for a year.

324
00:40:39,033 --> 00:40:42,243
Maybe that's unpaid later.

325
00:40:42,633 --> 00:40:49,143
Right. Right. But how do you quantify that and how do you do it in a way that's fair?

326
00:40:49,983 --> 00:40:53,943
This one is an idea that hasn't really been fully baked.

327
00:40:55,323 --> 00:41:04,623
Yeah. Which is just goes to show, you know, what's value added is not, you know, taking care of people is working in the workforce.

328
00:41:05,043 --> 00:41:11,283
Yeah. And our insurance is tied to that often, you know, if you don't qualify for Medicaid,

329
00:41:11,643 --> 00:41:18,123
aren't old enough or disabled to get Medicare and don't work and can't afford to buy private insurance,

330
00:41:18,903 --> 00:41:22,413
none of these benefits come to you because you're not you're not covered by insurance.

331
00:41:27,023 --> 00:41:29,393
Alzheimer project I just wanted to highlight here,

332
00:41:29,393 --> 00:41:42,743
because they've actually made some very specific recommendations and this is where the prior slide recommendations came from, expanding FMLA.

333
00:41:44,933 --> 00:41:54,593
And they've added this adds long term care savings accounts as well as tax credits.

334
00:41:58,553 --> 00:42:01,073
With respect to family medical leave.

335
00:42:03,023 --> 00:42:13,703
Anyone who's been working and has a child or has an elderly parent or a spouse that you have to drop out of the workforce temporarily to take care of.

336
00:42:15,113 --> 00:42:19,223
Has eligibility for family medical leave if they work for a large enough company?

337
00:42:21,413 --> 00:42:32,333
And as this indicates, a quarter of family caregivers are providing care to someone who doesn't fall under the laws definition.

338
00:42:33,233 --> 00:42:39,233
So I couldn't stop working and take care of a friend.

339
00:42:39,233 --> 00:42:39,953
For example,

340
00:42:41,543 --> 00:42:52,703
I could only take care of a sibling in-law grant if I couldn't take care of a sibling in LA grandparent it would have to be my immediate family.

341
00:42:53,333 --> 00:42:57,723
Now some employers have expanded it, but the law hasn't expanded it.

342
00:42:59,333 --> 00:43:11,663
And also, if you work for a small company, it's it's not required of that company and it's not paid.

343
00:43:11,873 --> 00:43:16,493
You're only protected from losing your job. Your company has to give you your job back.

344
00:43:18,953 --> 00:43:24,713
So these are all potential ways to expand and provide benefits.

345
00:43:29,633 --> 00:43:34,823
And I'm going to skip over this one to give us time for the final slides.

346
00:43:35,393 --> 00:43:39,353
This is what I talked about expanding funding for Older Americans Act.

347
00:43:40,373 --> 00:43:44,993
And then this is the working credits that we've already talked about.

348
00:43:47,553 --> 00:43:55,952
I want to move into talking a little bit about policy briefs and what you can do if you have a burning topic

349
00:43:55,953 --> 00:44:06,483
that you want to communicate to policymakers or participate in some activity that's going to promote change.

350
00:44:10,403 --> 00:44:16,643
Just basic knowledge, you know, to stay informed about what's going on in the case of caregivers.

351
00:44:17,693 --> 00:44:20,633
A lot of the activities of RES are very educational,

352
00:44:22,673 --> 00:44:29,153
trying to find out at the local or state level what's going on for the issue that you're most interested in.

353
00:44:31,133 --> 00:44:41,483
And then writing or finding a way to voice your story to someone who not only will listen, but has the ability to act.

354
00:44:41,753 --> 00:44:54,943
And that's really key. Policy briefs are not research papers, not the type of papers you write in school.

355
00:44:54,953 --> 00:45:04,373
Typically they're much shorter and they're designed to reach the audience of policymakers,

356
00:45:04,523 --> 00:45:12,863
and it's often the staffers rather than the actual policymaker who's going to read it in a way that they will take notice.

357
00:45:14,723 --> 00:45:17,183
So writing a policy brief isn't really enough.

358
00:45:17,513 --> 00:45:27,233
You also need to think in terms of how to target it, how to promote it, and who you can sit down and talk to about it.

359
00:45:28,943 --> 00:45:39,113
But policymakers are always looking for ways to be educated about whatever the issue is at hand, because most of them don't know this personally.

360
00:45:40,013 --> 00:45:51,053
They rely on the experts coming to them to learn about whatever the issues are that they're preparing to vote on or debate in,

361
00:45:51,803 --> 00:45:59,783
in the policymaking process. So it's really important to try to get an ear for someone who's making a decision.

362
00:45:59,933 --> 00:46:12,143
This could be at the local, state or federal level. And one of the things that chart prides itself on is trying to do this type of work,

363
00:46:12,683 --> 00:46:20,633
pulling out a lot of the evidence and objective evaluation and information,

364
00:46:21,323 --> 00:46:27,142
as well as in some cases going out to stakeholders and getting stakeholder input.

365
00:46:27,143 --> 00:46:34,252
Because we also have to keep in mind that policymaking can be sitting up on the mountain,

366
00:46:34,253 --> 00:46:40,403
looking down and thinking these are the best policies for the masses without knowing what they really need.

367
00:46:41,063 --> 00:46:45,383
You know, just feeling like we've been studying this for years, we know it.

368
00:46:46,043 --> 00:46:50,422
But when you yeah, there was actually a comment in the session.

369
00:46:50,423 --> 00:46:56,003
We went to a RTC that really struck me. And, you know, with public health,

370
00:46:56,423 --> 00:47:10,673
there was an example of public health in Detroit going to communities where there is an obesity epidemic and trying to promote obesity programs.

371
00:47:11,183 --> 00:47:16,493
When the community members said obesity is not what's important to us right now, it's gun control.

372
00:47:18,023 --> 00:47:20,513
Gun control is what we're interested in, not obesity.

373
00:47:21,593 --> 00:47:29,573
So, you know, they just didn't want to listen about from the public health experts because that wasn't the number one issue.

374
00:47:30,503 --> 00:47:34,153
So we have to be careful not to make too many assumptions about what's needed.

375
00:47:37,823 --> 00:47:48,713
Okay. I've already covered some of this. Policymakers aren't going to wade through a lot of detail and statistics.

376
00:47:49,183 --> 00:47:53,063
So you want to make sure that that's underpinning whatever you write.

377
00:47:53,573 --> 00:48:01,823
But that's not what you want to bring forward in, in a way that makes it hard to read.

378
00:48:03,443 --> 00:48:04,853
So it's a different type of writing.

379
00:48:05,873 --> 00:48:14,453
I actually the years I spent in consulting with Matt Stout, I learned because Ford Motor Company was one of my clients.

380
00:48:15,113 --> 00:48:23,243
I learned that if you were writing materials to educate them about benefits, generally, the rule of thumb was to write the eighth grade level.

381
00:48:24,623 --> 00:48:36,473
So we had to make sure that our writing to explain health care to the employee population was at a much more elementary level than you would think.

382
00:48:37,973 --> 00:48:39,112
And that's not always the case,

383
00:48:39,113 --> 00:48:48,683
but it's something to keep in mind to keep things straightforward and simplified and establishing yourself as an expert so you would be respected,

384
00:48:49,313 --> 00:48:53,813
respected and have already covered some of these points.

385
00:48:55,613 --> 00:49:03,353
I have a number of steps in these slides, and I'm going to go through them fairly quickly so I can leave a few minutes for

386
00:49:03,533 --> 00:49:07,493
questions that you might have and answering some of the questions that you've posed.

387
00:49:08,423 --> 00:49:19,533
Basically, you're wanting to start by really identifying all sides of the issues, and you need to have thoughts about what a solution might be.

388
00:49:19,553 --> 00:49:21,743
Don't want to just bring to someone the problem.

389
00:49:22,373 --> 00:49:29,573
You want to bring the problem and solution ideas in the same way when you're employed, you go to your boss with a problem.

390
00:49:30,203 --> 00:49:34,943
You don't just present the problem. You present all the solutions you have in mind too.

391
00:49:35,783 --> 00:49:40,763
I think that's a general rule of thumb and examples here.

392
00:49:41,153 --> 00:49:44,573
We've already talked about these at the local, state and national level.

393
00:49:48,393 --> 00:49:52,323
And then you really need to think about what is it that you want the policymaker to do?

394
00:49:53,373 --> 00:50:01,953
Are you want them to act on it? Are you wanting them to not go backwards to maintain whatever the status quo is?

395
00:50:02,553 --> 00:50:05,973
Are you preparing them and educating them for some future action?

396
00:50:06,483 --> 00:50:16,983
So think about what your goal is. And then, you know, you've probably been exposed to smart goals where they're measurable, achievable, relevant.

397
00:50:17,313 --> 00:50:26,073
And there's a time component. And I've pulled out the Alzheimer disease goal because I thought it was well defined.

398
00:50:26,943 --> 00:50:36,633
And here they're looking to buy a certain year, expand programs for caregivers focused on unmet needs and so on.

399
00:50:37,803 --> 00:50:44,523
Again, I'm not going to read the slide, but it's just an example of a smart goal to think about as you set your goals.

400
00:50:45,273 --> 00:50:51,333
And then one of the most important things is to understand your audience and what influences them.

401
00:50:52,023 --> 00:50:59,553
Is it going to be these various points I've raised here?

402
00:51:00,603 --> 00:51:10,113
If it's constituents, you may want stories that people have of the impact of of needing something in

403
00:51:10,113 --> 00:51:13,953
this case that might be and I'm using the caregiver example through these slides.

404
00:51:15,333 --> 00:51:19,143
There may be interest groups or stakeholders.

405
00:51:19,863 --> 00:51:21,272
You need to get to the staff.

406
00:51:21,273 --> 00:51:28,293
If it's a legislator because you won't have an audience with a legislator in the staff are likely to influence them the most.

407
00:51:31,303 --> 00:51:36,373
And then in the best of cases, you're using evidence based research,

408
00:51:37,783 --> 00:51:51,013
trying to find pros and cons and compelling information that promotes the solution that you're trying to put forth.

409
00:51:52,663 --> 00:52:01,603
You may want to supplement it with interviews and case studies because that personal touch and that storytelling makes all the difference.

410
00:52:01,903 --> 00:52:03,933
Unlike a research paper, you know,

411
00:52:03,973 --> 00:52:13,213
this is where bringing in the stories of people who are impacted by whatever it is that you're trying to change is very important.

412
00:52:16,033 --> 00:52:25,573
And then I have a few examples, and these references were included in the caregiver brief.

413
00:52:26,863 --> 00:52:28,393
And again, I'm not going to read them.

414
00:52:31,003 --> 00:52:39,823
I provide a general outline of what you might think about in terms of the framework of a policy brief, starting with a catchy title.

415
00:52:40,033 --> 00:52:45,283
Because these are the sorts of things where you have to think almost like a PR person.

416
00:52:45,713 --> 00:52:50,923
You know what's going to catch people's attention and how can I sell my idea?

417
00:52:55,143 --> 00:53:04,923
And again, I'm not going to read the slide. Some design considerations for you to look at in your spare time if you want to go down this path.

418
00:53:05,763 --> 00:53:11,283
And then distribution, you have already talked about some of this.

419
00:53:11,883 --> 00:53:16,263
But social media can make a huge difference as well.

420
00:53:16,323 --> 00:53:19,353
If you're you know, you're probably better at that than I am.

421
00:53:22,153 --> 00:53:28,243
And questions. Thank you so much.

422
00:53:30,533 --> 00:53:37,313
Tremendous amount of information. And yeah, I kind of hit you with a lot, but hopefully you have some takeaways here that might be useful.

423
00:53:37,943 --> 00:53:40,493
And I know there were some, I guess,

424
00:53:40,493 --> 00:53:46,792
first other questions that you haven't already answered about the materials I provided and then I don't know if there's time,

425
00:53:46,793 --> 00:53:52,433
Phil, but look at their questions that you showed me briefly. Yeah, let's see what questions we have now.

426
00:53:54,743 --> 00:54:02,933
And yes. So going back to what's going on in Washington, I mean, I don't know how much you can do for anything, but like.

427
00:54:04,783 --> 00:54:09,383
What do you know? Will it work for, like, cash pay?

428
00:54:09,413 --> 00:54:14,983
Like, will they be able to take someone else for, like, cash papers to use in the future?

429
00:54:15,553 --> 00:54:21,723
When you say cash pay facilities, what do you mean? Like, is that what it's working on for the money?

430
00:54:21,733 --> 00:54:27,083
Like. Because there's a. Like they built.

431
00:54:29,913 --> 00:54:40,443
A living facility like where it's like $2,000 a month and it's only cash pay, oh, like assisted living, those types of programs.

432
00:54:41,013 --> 00:54:47,223
Those are often not all, but many assisted living facilities are for profit.

433
00:54:48,273 --> 00:54:53,283
Some of them are under religious organizations nonprofit, some standalone nonprofit.

434
00:54:53,973 --> 00:54:58,233
Most of them are not regulated by the state.

435
00:54:58,713 --> 00:55:03,573
Some states have included them in their regulations, as with nursing homes.

436
00:55:03,603 --> 00:55:09,983
Nursing homes are heavily, heavily regulated assisted living and independent living.

437
00:55:10,203 --> 00:55:19,833
The type of communities that people buy into typically are often not covered by any state regulations in terms of,

438
00:55:21,123 --> 00:55:26,223
you know, other than housing, you know, there are housing requirements.

439
00:55:26,643 --> 00:55:36,093
But in terms of how they handle their payments, their services, you know, often that's left up to them.

440
00:55:36,513 --> 00:55:41,463
Some states do have regulations. Michigan does not, which is part of the reason.

441
00:55:41,463 --> 00:55:49,053
And this is this is curious part of the reason all the reporting for COVID was just for the nursing homes is because the

442
00:55:49,053 --> 00:55:55,713
state had no line of sight to what was going on in other residential facilities because it wasn't covered by state law.

443
00:55:57,843 --> 00:56:05,763
It makes it difficult for the person in the family looking to use assisted living because

444
00:56:06,213 --> 00:56:13,653
it becomes their own decision without a whole lot of ways of checking for quality,

445
00:56:14,223 --> 00:56:17,043
because there's no quality measurement in states that don't have regulations.

446
00:56:18,183 --> 00:56:22,713
States that do are starting to have some of the same similar requirements as

447
00:56:22,713 --> 00:56:30,333
nursing homes in terms of reporting on the part of the assisted living facilities,

448
00:56:31,323 --> 00:56:36,932
staffing levels, things like that. But states that don't have those requirements, there's no staffing requirement.

449
00:56:36,933 --> 00:56:40,173
There's no other types of requirements.

450
00:56:40,803 --> 00:56:49,443
So it varies drastically state to state, and people's rights are also tied to the state.

451
00:56:50,103 --> 00:57:00,633
So if I'm in a state that has regulated assisted living, I can go to the Ombudsman's office or go someplace.

452
00:57:00,633 --> 00:57:04,833
If there's a problem. If I'm in a state that doesn't have that, I'm on my own.

453
00:57:09,083 --> 00:57:17,003
Does that answer your question? I just have a follow up to like I guess I don't really know much about like Social Security and things like that.

454
00:57:17,003 --> 00:57:28,433
So like you said, 36 grand is what they're hoping to get up to or be able to pay into the long term care the money for Washington.

455
00:57:30,803 --> 00:57:37,223
Like, so is that how much people have to pay into it before they have to get it or.

456
00:57:37,493 --> 00:57:42,383
No, it's the requirements are paying into it.

457
00:57:43,253 --> 00:57:46,493
It's either five or ten years. I'd have to look up the exact details.

458
00:57:46,733 --> 00:57:49,403
And the reason I know this is it's a little controversial.

459
00:57:49,403 --> 00:57:55,373
I have friends who live in Washington, and I brought this up with them and I was saying what a wonderful thing Washington is doing this.

460
00:57:55,703 --> 00:58:02,362
And then I got an earful from them because they're in their sixties and they said, we're being required to pay into this.

461
00:58:02,363 --> 00:58:07,373
But unless we work for I think it was five years, we don't benefit.

462
00:58:08,243 --> 00:58:16,642
So. Okay, so there's a minimum period you have to pay in and it's and you get I think

463
00:58:16,643 --> 00:58:21,803
you then get the full benefits even if you haven't paid in the full amount.

464
00:58:22,403 --> 00:58:26,093
Um, I don't know all the intricacies of it.

465
00:58:27,353 --> 00:58:35,183
And knowing how expensive long term care services are, it's not that much that you get, but it's better than nothing.

466
00:58:36,353 --> 00:58:47,243
It's probably this one is actually more beneficial for people with a lower income because the payment into it is based on your income.

467
00:58:47,963 --> 00:58:56,123
The benefit is more of a fixed benefit. So again, I can't tell you all the intricacies of it.

468
00:58:56,453 --> 00:59:00,983
I just know a little bit enough to know that it's a really interesting program.

469
00:59:01,793 --> 00:59:05,043
Thank you. Yes.

470
00:59:06,093 --> 00:59:08,493
Just like in terms of like success stories.

471
00:59:08,493 --> 00:59:15,152
Like do you feel like other countries that you feel like have just done this really well or like it's like one state in the U.S. that's,

472
00:59:15,153 --> 00:59:18,993
like really exemplary that's done this really well. Well,

473
00:59:19,053 --> 00:59:27,303
other countries have really looked at social services in an integrated way for a long time where they

474
00:59:27,303 --> 00:59:35,133
haven't just isolated health care services and social services and dealt with them completely separately.

475
00:59:36,333 --> 00:59:49,353
Filipinos, Canada. In Europe, in many situations, if someone is eligible for services in the home,

476
00:59:50,643 --> 00:59:59,943
they will receive public funding to help them stay in the home versus going to an institution for the rest of their life.

477
01:00:02,523 --> 01:00:09,163
I have some relatives in Israel who were disabled for several years.

478
01:00:09,183 --> 01:00:13,323
They stayed in their home the whole time. Partially publicly funded.

479
01:00:14,103 --> 01:00:17,343
That's not what happens here at all.

480
01:00:18,843 --> 01:00:25,443
Now, granted, a fairly sizable tax supports that in these countries.

481
01:00:26,913 --> 01:00:33,723
But if you look at the combination of what we spend on health care and the combination of what we spend on social services.

482
01:00:35,253 --> 01:00:40,533
That combined is greater than most European countries.

483
01:00:43,573 --> 01:00:49,183
So in terms of exemplary states, I'd certainly look at California.

484
01:00:49,243 --> 01:00:50,323
Massachusetts,

485
01:00:50,713 --> 01:01:00,913
they've been very progressive with their especially with their Medicaid programs and the other pockets of experimentation out there as well.

486
01:01:03,883 --> 01:01:07,963
Yes, sir. Regarding the Medicaid waivers, I know you said that.

487
01:01:08,853 --> 01:01:10,183
I think you said that basically.

488
01:01:11,313 --> 01:01:19,333
That's the budget and that is it that states apply for those like a portion of those that money allocated for waivers.

489
01:01:20,133 --> 01:01:22,713
It's actually not money allocated for waivers.

490
01:01:23,523 --> 01:01:35,583
States often provide a lot of technical assistance and support, but the states actually have to apply for the waivers.

491
01:01:36,243 --> 01:01:46,143
And then within the Medicaid budget, which includes federal funding and state funding, it has to be budget neutral typically.

492
01:01:47,283 --> 01:01:56,073
So it's a state that's looking for ways to sometimes reduce their costs by being able to utilize it,

493
01:01:56,073 --> 01:02:02,133
because they can't use the funds for non approved services unless they get a waiver.

494
01:02:03,033 --> 01:02:11,793
So the waiver allows them to offer different services, offer services to different populations.

495
01:02:13,653 --> 01:02:21,663
And the waivers are typically designed to be cost effective or to test a new idea.

496
01:02:22,833 --> 01:02:28,143
But it's not like the state can can get a waiver to get an influx of money.

497
01:02:28,223 --> 01:02:31,803
Okay. Gotcha. It's. Which is why some states haven't done it.

498
01:02:32,043 --> 01:02:35,733
Yeah, that's what I was curious about, is different states applying.

499
01:02:37,783 --> 01:02:47,893
Why don't they? I can't. Now it does. Sometimes I would qualify that there are some waivers where there's a shifting of

500
01:02:47,893 --> 01:02:56,653
federal state money so the federal funds can be used for things that are new,

501
01:02:57,403 --> 01:03:04,543
and then the state funds can go for the basic services, and they typically look to see cost savings.

502
01:03:05,233 --> 01:03:09,193
So it's a way that states have actually been able to reduce their expenditures.

503
01:03:09,793 --> 01:03:14,933
If they do it right right now, that's going to be something I read about more because.

504
01:03:15,573 --> 01:03:17,043
Interesting how that works that.

505
01:03:17,453 --> 01:03:27,273
So I'm from Mississippi and think it's like we've all known that, you know, the health disparities that are present in Mississippi are pretty obvious.

506
01:03:27,873 --> 01:03:38,793
And so I'm curious about how these are waivers for other states and like any improvements that could be made and things like that.

507
01:03:38,823 --> 01:03:50,973
Mm hmm. Yeah, that's. Yeah. I mean, I haven't looked specifically at Mississippi's waiver choices, but given, you know,

508
01:03:51,003 --> 01:03:55,803
I think Mississippi is low on the list of use of home and community based services.

509
01:03:55,813 --> 01:04:05,163
For example, if you look at all the states, I don't have that in my head, but there's certainly likely be opportunities.

510
01:04:07,693 --> 01:04:11,683
You probably have a powerful nursing home industry which makes it more difficult.

511
01:04:13,513 --> 01:04:21,643
And I think this time in vitro you put into the slide deck, there was a link, there was a graph of all the spending for the different states.

512
01:04:22,273 --> 01:04:26,983
And I'd be curious to see what Mississippi is. Yeah, I have a slide back on my computer.

513
01:04:27,523 --> 01:04:37,093
I didn't I didn't put that in here, but. Well, I think we're probably at time.

514
01:04:37,103 --> 01:04:40,583
So thank you so very much. Very welcome.

515
01:04:40,603 --> 01:04:45,583
Just a great to hear all this depth of information from someone who knows us so well.

516
01:04:45,883 --> 01:04:51,763
Thank you for. Thanks for joining us. I really appreciate you inviting me and getting to meet all of you.

517
01:04:53,273 --> 01:04:56,543
And good luck in the study session. All right.

518
01:04:56,543 --> 01:05:00,173
So we'll take a ten minute break and then we will hear some familiar.

519
01:05:05,593 --> 01:05:08,623
Was. Gentlemen.

520
01:05:11,843 --> 01:05:14,233
So it's a whole thing that I feel like I've never really been.

521
01:05:16,263 --> 01:05:22,803
Oh, there's so much I've done, what I struggled with, what to include and not to travel around too much.

522
01:05:22,803 --> 01:05:44,423
Because it's just so. We need to figure out how policy right there down that.

523
01:05:45,653 --> 01:05:54,593
That's a subject in and of itself. And. There's a lot of legislation and I don't know what's going to go forward.

524
01:05:55,913 --> 01:06:02,693
There's a bill that has just been kind of hanging there that I think is a.

525
01:06:05,573 --> 01:06:13,463
Because they were wanting to try to get something in place for the emergency and the emergency ends.

526
01:06:13,943 --> 01:06:16,373
Why do these things fall by the wayside?

527
01:06:17,643 --> 01:06:26,282
So as long as that's still in effect, which I think it's been extended three months, it doesn't change anything.

528
01:06:26,283 --> 01:06:31,983
But once it ends, there are a lot of things that are reformed, not just telehealth.

529
01:06:34,323 --> 01:06:40,813
And some states are using their ARPA money for infrastructure.

530
01:06:42,723 --> 01:06:46,153
But that's going to take time. Yeah.

531
01:06:46,573 --> 01:06:51,853
I mean, they're putting credits for people to purchase right now.

532
01:06:53,143 --> 01:07:03,373
I think it's important to our presentation. The you know, if you meet a certain income requirement, you can get broadband for a discount.

533
01:07:04,153 --> 01:07:09,903
And that's part of the. Now the emergency.

534
01:07:10,393 --> 01:07:19,273
So that's going to have. So yeah, the more that we can do I suppose to provide information to push that forward.

535
01:07:20,353 --> 01:07:27,313
Yeah. I haven't thought about how to do that. Yeah I, I don't know either but um.

536
01:07:28,033 --> 01:07:29,862
Yeah, I dunno. Gave me a connection with some of them.

537
01:07:29,863 --> 01:07:38,083
We tried for a long time, but Maryanne was really, you know, encouraging her to do something that was a bit.

538
01:07:38,353 --> 01:07:41,903
And talk on the table. Talk to us.

539
01:07:41,983 --> 01:07:45,253
Really. She was. Wasn't. What can we ask?

540
01:07:45,293 --> 01:07:50,243
Well, thanks again. Yeah.

541
01:07:53,113 --> 01:07:57,073
Yeah, that's such a good one. All right.

542
01:07:57,463 --> 01:08:00,673
Okay. Thanks. Good bye, everyone. I.

543
01:08:07,553 --> 01:08:11,103
Yes. It's good to see you. Do you know where it is?

544
01:08:12,003 --> 01:08:16,893
Did you send it to your this? Oh, yeah.

545
01:08:19,323 --> 01:08:59,873
Okay. Okay. Perfect. Thank you so much.

546
01:09:01,453 --> 01:09:08,483
No, not yet. I so.

547
01:09:12,243 --> 01:09:16,693
You're talking about my connecting with someone? Yeah.

548
01:09:17,453 --> 01:09:23,223
You know something? Oh, yeah.

549
01:09:24,033 --> 01:09:30,573
Yeah. No. So.

550
01:09:34,423 --> 01:09:39,403
Nothing. Because we can range from Christmas to just.

551
01:09:40,403 --> 01:09:49,253
Yeah. So unless they lay down on. Having an email.

552
01:09:49,453 --> 01:09:56,023
Yeah. Yeah. Then I got to up in time there.

553
01:09:56,593 --> 01:10:01,943
Right. Right. So what got you interested in your research.

554
01:10:04,053 --> 01:10:08,173
Which is coming back. If I get my purse.

555
01:10:10,993 --> 01:10:14,163
I just withdraw.

556
01:10:14,523 --> 01:10:17,973
I'm good. It's not very fun. I'm missing something.

557
01:10:18,663 --> 01:10:24,993
All right. Did you get all the stories?

558
01:10:26,453 --> 01:10:32,833
And it can go right in as a patient.

559
01:10:34,033 --> 01:10:38,323
Interesting. Yeah, I know.

560
01:10:39,653 --> 01:10:48,313
Yeah. We also have that unfortunate thing about expectations for my students.

561
01:10:49,963 --> 01:10:55,333
I don't think I'm going to tell you what it is about your expectations.

562
01:10:55,963 --> 01:11:01,333
Yeah, like I think what you're doing to compare that to populations of two countries is really novel.

563
01:11:03,013 --> 01:11:10,573
Yes, I would say you can see it. I know it's kind of there, but if you like it, it's fine.

564
01:11:10,753 --> 01:11:13,963
You know that I know anything about South Korea.

565
01:11:15,943 --> 01:11:21,783
You know what I mean? Yeah, right.

566
01:11:21,793 --> 01:11:28,272
Okay. Yeah. I mean, you can certainly. Well, I guess, you know the interpretation wise.

567
01:11:28,273 --> 01:11:31,853
Yes. Which is wrong. Yeah.

568
01:11:32,323 --> 01:11:50,803
Yeah. Should I get started?

569
01:11:51,423 --> 01:11:53,123
Yeah. So here we go.

570
01:11:53,283 --> 01:12:02,793
And then if you don't know me, I'm concentrating on research paper, looking at functional limitation and depressive symptom in older adults.

571
01:12:03,363 --> 01:12:10,443
In this paper, focus on the role of social support in moderating the association.

572
01:12:11,823 --> 01:12:18,273
And it's not surprising that this study was conducted in response to the aging of the population.

573
01:12:18,933 --> 01:12:25,533
And I don't know that the number of people over age 65 is expected to double by 2030.

574
01:12:26,193 --> 01:12:35,163
And one of the public health concerns with older population is that the decline in both physical and cognitive function as they age,

575
01:12:35,883 --> 01:12:43,473
and it's well-established that a functional limitation is strongly correlated with depressive symptoms in older adults.

576
01:12:44,103 --> 01:12:52,023
And this could be because of the loss of autonomy and hopelessness about independent living.

577
01:12:52,983 --> 01:13:00,753
And we know that social support. Can both media and moderate affect a functional limitation on mental health?

578
01:13:01,263 --> 01:13:09,303
And they many tie up support. And some of them I could be informal from friends, from friend or family.

579
01:13:09,693 --> 01:13:19,683
And they're also a formal sort of support, such at the state office of the Federal or State Program for Medical Assistance, Long Term Care.

580
01:13:21,093 --> 01:13:28,173
One of such program is, as we know from earlier, is the home and community based services.

581
01:13:29,013 --> 01:13:38,283
This program offer health care services for individuals with significant physical and cognitive limitation in their own home or community.

582
01:13:38,733 --> 01:13:42,393
Instead of a distinction like nursing home setting.

583
01:13:43,533 --> 01:13:57,033
And about 80% of this program is funded through Medicaid and they are increasing in Medicaid spending at home and community based services.

584
01:13:57,543 --> 01:14:00,243
But they vary ation across state.

585
01:14:00,513 --> 01:14:15,633
For example, the total Medicaid spending for home and community based services could range from 1100 to either 1100 $80 per person over the 85 July,

586
01:14:15,783 --> 01:14:18,893
the high dollar in Mississippi. Here we go.

587
01:14:22,653 --> 01:14:29,582
And in this paper, the researcher highlighted three important gaps that in the research are looking

588
01:14:29,583 --> 01:14:34,353
at the association between functional limitation and depressive symptoms.

589
01:14:34,353 --> 01:14:39,843
And one of them is that most of the if they usually just look at functional status on depression,

590
01:14:40,383 --> 01:14:46,022
so they little know about how the change in the function affect the passage of time.

591
01:14:46,023 --> 01:14:54,363
And we know is important. As people get older, they may not mean they may start out very good, have a high level of function,

592
01:14:54,363 --> 01:15:03,183
but at they age the decline in function in most of the study usually focused on the individual and they

593
01:15:03,513 --> 01:15:09,003
need to know about this bowel function and how does bowel function can affect their depressive symptom.

594
01:15:11,733 --> 01:15:22,832
They usually focus on the informal support by friend and family, so there would be a need to assess how formal sort of supports that.

595
01:15:22,833 --> 01:15:31,533
You have to stay home and community based services moderate association between functional limitation and depressive symptom.

596
01:15:33,003 --> 01:15:44,253
So given that research gap, this study looking at the different dimension of functional limitation and depressive symptoms as

597
01:15:44,253 --> 01:15:53,093
well as how informal and formal support can moderate our association and the data they that they use

598
01:15:53,123 --> 01:16:03,383
a how any time and study in the period from 1993 to 2000 and to the end of the medical sample consisted

599
01:16:03,393 --> 01:16:14,843
of about 5500 individuals born in 1923 or earlier and a mean A for the sample a about 77 year.

600
01:16:17,353 --> 01:16:23,343
I'm in and I say that these people are looking at a different dimension of functional limitation,

601
01:16:23,353 --> 01:16:28,333
and it could be a limitation in if we a limitation in cognitive function.

602
01:16:30,523 --> 01:16:37,363
They also look at acute and chronic limitation as well as an individual limitation.

603
01:16:37,493 --> 01:16:49,422
And and this limitation and depressive symptoms in this study were assessed by the Center for Epidemiol Center for Epidemiologic Study,

604
01:16:49,423 --> 01:16:51,223
Depression Scale or the CSO.

605
01:16:51,223 --> 01:17:02,293
And in the ACO at eight an item scale that measure depressive symptoms during the pathway and they do a cut of support for more symptom as a case.

606
01:17:05,613 --> 01:17:09,333
And they're a tool of support that puts them in this study.

607
01:17:10,083 --> 01:17:16,413
The fuss it announced about informal support and this a measure by asking the individual

608
01:17:16,413 --> 01:17:21,093
whether they are receiving enjoyment or support from their family or friend,

609
01:17:21,513 --> 01:17:25,983
or whether they expect to receive such support when they need it in the future.

610
01:17:27,093 --> 01:17:34,893
The second selfless support that will look at either stay home and community services support and is in measure

611
01:17:34,893 --> 01:17:44,883
by dividing the state expenditure for home and community based services by the number of people over age 65.

612
01:17:48,173 --> 01:17:51,803
And they use the mix of fact logistic regression.

613
01:17:51,803 --> 01:17:58,522
And this modeling approach can account for the clustering in the data as well as allow them to

614
01:17:58,523 --> 01:18:04,583
incorporate information from all time poor instead of just observation with just a complete follow up.

615
01:18:06,083 --> 01:18:11,553
And to look at the moderating effect support content.

616
01:18:11,573 --> 01:18:19,493
They used several two way and three way interaction between functional limitation and support content.

617
01:18:22,183 --> 01:18:25,153
I'm still trying to do some filing of this paper.

618
01:18:25,783 --> 01:18:35,173
So this table is from the area that we read, and it's showing the odds ratio for a different dimension or functional limitation.

619
01:18:35,923 --> 01:18:39,373
And we can see that low and declining function in daily,

620
01:18:39,373 --> 01:18:50,592
weekly and cognitive ability were associated with a high the art of the past symptom and not only the individual functional limitation.

621
01:18:50,593 --> 01:18:57,193
They also found that the spatial cognitive function have a larger association with depressive symptom.

622
01:18:58,703 --> 01:19:05,172
How? Hello. I don't think that there much of a difference in terms of the ratio that we're looking at.

623
01:19:05,173 --> 01:19:08,323
The ratio of 1.5 was at one point grief.

624
01:19:11,743 --> 01:19:19,213
And in relation to the and and for the fighting in relation to self support,

625
01:19:20,023 --> 01:19:25,843
they found that older adults with informal support have a lower level of depressive symptoms.

626
01:19:26,683 --> 01:19:34,583
But this they support for home and community based services have no significant meaning affair and

627
01:19:34,843 --> 01:19:41,713
all what I was saying this inspectors because for an average our older adult with life cognitive

628
01:19:41,713 --> 01:19:47,783
function they may not even aware of the life resources available to them so they would not be

629
01:19:47,833 --> 01:19:56,143
expected like this on spending on this program would have any effect on their mental health.

630
01:19:58,423 --> 01:20:10,033
Um, so this a difficult form of paper and on the y axis it is basically showing the predicted barbarity of

631
01:20:10,033 --> 01:20:18,793
having depression and x axis a state expenditure for home and community based services and different,

632
01:20:18,793 --> 01:20:23,323
like for like different level of functional limitation.

633
01:20:24,073 --> 01:20:27,793
And in this case they will live in function, no limitation.

634
01:20:28,813 --> 01:20:38,143
We can see that live high expenditure were associated with lower depressive symptom among those with fire more limitation.

635
01:20:39,793 --> 01:20:46,003
And they also found that higher expenditure were associated with lower depression

636
01:20:46,933 --> 01:20:52,843
in among those with a more dramatic decline in the daily living function.

637
01:20:56,143 --> 01:21:03,282
So in this figure it was similar to reverse slide but in this was showing predicted

638
01:21:03,283 --> 01:21:12,163
possibility of depressive symptom on the y axis and the x axis with the state expenditure.

639
01:21:12,163 --> 01:21:19,213
But then they stratifying that by whether an individual had informal help or not.

640
01:21:20,173 --> 01:21:23,173
And we can see what among the what the family,

641
01:21:23,173 --> 01:21:30,913
how they're not what of the difference in the effect of the state expenditure

642
01:21:30,913 --> 01:21:37,483
on the association between functional limitation and depressive symptoms?

643
01:21:37,993 --> 01:21:41,952
How low among the what style of family?

644
01:21:41,953 --> 01:21:47,863
How high the expenditure was associated with lower depressive symptom?

645
01:21:50,923 --> 01:21:54,983
And this research was significant for many reasons.

646
01:21:56,083 --> 01:22:01,923
The why it well established that functional limitations were correlated with depression symptoms.

647
01:22:03,133 --> 01:22:08,893
The study also demonstrating that change in functional limitation was associated with

648
01:22:08,893 --> 01:22:16,533
depressive symptom and this a significant given the older population is commonly experienced.

649
01:22:16,963 --> 01:22:30,343
Fortunately, as they age, the study also look at this functional limitation and how it affects depressive symptoms after individual and they see us.

650
01:22:30,583 --> 01:22:38,523
And another research significance of this study is that it look at the moderating role of

651
01:22:38,533 --> 01:22:44,533
form of sort of support in buffering the stress of functional decline is important given

652
01:22:44,533 --> 01:22:51,073
that with the aging of baby boomer who have fewer children and they may not have the informal

653
01:22:51,073 --> 01:22:57,573
support from their family having a formal sort of support made up for this tragic stage.

654
01:23:00,373 --> 01:23:08,413
So some of the strength of this study so is again the first study that looking at the moderating role,

655
01:23:08,413 --> 01:23:16,872
a form of the poor in buffering addressed a functional limitation and they used the how in a time and study

656
01:23:16,873 --> 01:23:24,762
which a large population based survey of older Americans with a wealth of data on functional limitation

657
01:23:24,763 --> 01:23:33,823
would allow them to look at a different dimension of functional limitation in the last and to another strand

658
01:23:33,823 --> 01:23:43,392
of this study a in the method they use a mix effect modeling to account for the clustering in the data.

659
01:23:43,393 --> 01:23:50,383
They also have very good indicator that controlling for potential confounder as well as biased.

660
01:23:50,833 --> 01:23:59,653
It could be from um and by do do like that natal mortality or loss of follow up.

661
01:24:03,753 --> 01:24:14,853
One of the things, one of the main limitation of this study that they have a sample individual over a 70 with a higher risk for mortality

662
01:24:14,853 --> 01:24:23,313
and comorbidity so compared the risk to present in their fighting and that made by a to a healthier individual who

663
01:24:23,313 --> 01:24:35,672
might survive do a 70 and they are also uncertainty in the assessment of the fat up within individual chain in functional

664
01:24:35,673 --> 01:24:47,183
limitation as the older individual have a fewer observation as compared to the younger and the assembling design.

665
01:24:47,223 --> 01:24:59,102
I excluding the stay, would lower expenditure for home and community based services, so this finding may not be generalized to all the US.

666
01:24:59,103 --> 01:25:04,502
They and lastly they combined unmarried and marry individual.

667
01:25:04,503 --> 01:25:10,593
But then these two group could have um there may be differences in their to group

668
01:25:10,593 --> 01:25:16,383
and then future research can look at both the marry and marry individual separately.

669
01:25:19,113 --> 01:25:27,243
And this a some of the discussion the question that I have so one of the surprising finding that the although we're talking

670
01:25:27,243 --> 01:25:36,182
about is that the older adult what like cognitive in that older adult without the family support were more depressed if

671
01:25:36,183 --> 01:25:44,463
they're living in a state with a higher Spanish home and community service and they hypothesizing that it could be depressing

672
01:25:44,763 --> 01:25:51,873
to recognize that these type of resources are only available for the poor people or the people with cognitive impair.

673
01:25:52,413 --> 01:25:55,592
And are you convinced that that's all like why or why not?

674
01:25:55,593 --> 01:26:06,903
And what the reason for this fighting and then by the benefits and the challenges in implementing all that sustaining these higher program.

675
01:26:08,163 --> 01:26:17,583
And the last question are is that why are the way that the federal or the state government could support the health and aging in older adults?

676
01:26:19,573 --> 01:26:25,983
Thank you. Are there any questions or comments?

677
01:26:27,403 --> 01:26:34,513
I have a question about loan limitation. You mention one thing about being intimate or taking the second one.

678
01:26:35,623 --> 01:26:43,063
Could you please explain this more? Like what kind of team is in trying to be so light inquiry?

679
01:26:43,063 --> 01:26:47,413
Like between people and people, person in person be an intra in within.

680
01:26:47,413 --> 01:26:51,113
So like one person can have different employee empowerment and achieve.

681
01:26:51,473 --> 01:27:01,893
They met within one person in that income. So they only assess the their function of a cognitive function at one time.

682
01:27:01,903 --> 01:27:08,802
Point in that is because they have a group of like really old people and then don't old people,

683
01:27:08,803 --> 01:27:20,233
they usually have a feel observation because the day they become they die, pass away or like they have dementia and they could not is a deep question.

684
01:27:20,233 --> 01:27:24,342
So they have to deal with what is it like if you have like three timepoint time,

685
01:27:24,343 --> 01:27:32,023
then you would know, like I said, the elimination, all that if you have to really spend any more.

686
01:27:32,923 --> 01:27:41,203
Thank you. I wonder what people thought about the you know, that they're assessing.

687
01:27:42,013 --> 01:27:46,783
They're looking at the state availability of the home and community services.

688
01:27:47,113 --> 01:27:52,543
But is there any way to know if these as participants are using those services,

689
01:27:53,143 --> 01:27:56,413
or is it just like assuming that if they're there, they will be using them?

690
01:27:57,103 --> 01:28:04,932
Yeah, yeah. I don't know. I haven't yet had a really big data set and I don't really have I know whether they asked a question

691
01:28:04,933 --> 01:28:11,983
but that's a good point I this available data but and of people use it it's maybe different and yeah.

692
01:28:16,473 --> 01:28:25,053
So that kind of goes along with your first point. It's kind of a stretch to say they recognize that they even have the support, you know?

693
01:28:26,053 --> 01:28:31,842
For it to be making them depressed, because I was wondering about that to some of the like you said,

694
01:28:31,843 --> 01:28:36,343
that cognitively intact, older adults with no family support,

695
01:28:36,343 --> 01:28:41,713
more depressed if living in a high state by age seniors expenditures that it

696
01:28:41,713 --> 01:28:46,243
would depend on if they even know about those expenditures in the first place.

697
01:28:46,573 --> 01:28:51,762
Yeah, yeah. I think if they don't use it, then it doesn't really make sense to make this statement.

698
01:28:51,763 --> 01:28:58,173
And I even think it could be detection bias too, because they they like New York,

699
01:28:58,303 --> 01:29:04,123
they probably have more like geriatric psychiatrists and just have access to them and more likely to be diagnosed.

700
01:29:04,763 --> 01:29:09,343
Was it Mississippi? What I think I don't know how many like to get sick.

701
01:29:09,403 --> 01:29:17,833
I guess you have that. But I've got to say that one the two and then did like you never know you know in no way that you're depressed.

702
01:29:22,413 --> 01:29:29,762
So what we'll do now, let's get into small groups of about three people or so and invite you to,

703
01:29:29,763 --> 01:29:37,683
to discuss any of the questions here or answer even some of the questions that Dr. Ron Towle posed about writing policy briefs,

704
01:29:37,983 --> 01:29:39,033
kind of thinking that through.

705
01:29:39,393 --> 01:29:47,793
So we'll do that for about 10 to 12 minutes, and then we'll regroup and kind of share what our thoughts and what we'd come up with.

706
01:29:59,693 --> 01:30:11,563
This is the first time that the fashion houses.

707
01:30:13,513 --> 01:30:24,853
Since 1980. This.

708
01:30:26,813 --> 01:30:34,703
And when I read about.

709
01:30:36,833 --> 01:30:47,003
I feel like I've been on the sidelines and it's like I was blown away by the expectations and I was like,

710
01:30:47,033 --> 01:30:52,413
everyone is going to be right here, talk about what's going on.

711
01:30:52,823 --> 01:30:58,883
And I was always very likely to because in this game I think they are cognitive functioning, strong,

712
01:30:59,183 --> 01:31:06,323
powerful in terms of what they can, maybe even because it's so really it's a high octane empowerment.

713
01:31:06,713 --> 01:31:11,743
Participants in the history of this category are still in the U.S. Navy and have a

714
01:31:11,753 --> 01:31:18,483
relatively high functioning compared to about 99 or really have a personal injury paramount.

715
01:31:18,503 --> 01:31:27,713
You never get out. And so I was thinking maybe there is a risk that I was I was wondering why they

716
01:31:28,133 --> 01:31:33,973
have this like from people always know how my how but one thing about the thing.

717
01:31:35,183 --> 01:31:42,983
Just knowing that they do not realize how he uses sources and how to identify them and

718
01:31:43,173 --> 01:31:48,413
when they know that there is this kind of source of we are not at war with the USA,

719
01:31:49,253 --> 01:32:00,863
but it still doesn't make sense because like when you realize there are some sources you could be more positive about is instead of being warned.

720
01:32:01,743 --> 01:32:04,972
Yeah, yeah, yeah. That's pretty dangerous.

721
01:32:04,973 --> 01:32:08,752
Yeah. And I think more studies should be conducted by this.

722
01:32:08,753 --> 01:32:13,163
And also we want to conduct more research on this.

723
01:32:13,163 --> 01:32:19,283
We know more data and more reality feeds where it can make it more in real politic.

724
01:32:21,603 --> 01:32:24,603
She measures improve response to this.

725
01:32:24,603 --> 01:32:29,643
And I agree with your point about recruiting.

726
01:32:29,853 --> 01:32:40,283
I believe that some of it's really human caused injuries and that cognitive where Heidi is participating is because as I said,

727
01:32:40,293 --> 01:32:43,773
the access and those successes, maybe some biases.

728
01:32:44,313 --> 01:32:49,022
Yeah. And also like this is not the same person I've seen.

729
01:32:49,023 --> 01:32:52,773
Like when I like I was wondering if we offer something,

730
01:32:53,213 --> 01:32:59,073
something like family health to this and the participant has what would happen

731
01:32:59,073 --> 01:33:04,202
to their depression status or their depression stats like smoking status,

732
01:33:04,203 --> 01:33:08,503
lifestyle or. Yeah, I look at that.

733
01:33:08,613 --> 01:33:15,543
Yeah, that's a good point. Yeah. So I don't know because people always have a family.

734
01:33:15,543 --> 01:33:21,793
How you could say that with these expectations, those are your decisions and guidelines.

735
01:33:21,813 --> 01:33:25,503
And also it's just slightly large.

736
01:33:27,373 --> 01:33:33,093
You know, around? Yeah. I think when you look at the modeling program in terms of business and I.

737
01:33:33,883 --> 01:33:37,983
From the audio version. Maybe they did it for.

738
01:33:37,993 --> 01:33:49,753
I feel like if you do your job and try to be like yeah the biggest challenge I.

739
01:33:51,533 --> 01:33:58,043
You know, if you're going to have something that we have, that we have,

740
01:33:58,883 --> 01:34:06,563
that you see about policy in terms of the relevance for the European Council, which you probably just didn't know.

741
01:34:06,583 --> 01:34:18,153
Yeah. Jason Collins. He is definitely among the first and most important step being like changing people's counsel because it's like it depends on,

742
01:34:18,163 --> 01:34:22,293
like I mentioned in my that, that it's like the external system.

743
01:34:22,323 --> 01:34:30,602
And I think the most effective actually are where they change the external environment more changing

744
01:34:30,603 --> 01:34:37,773
people's outcomes because it's like when the first time you did that for my it's with this of.

745
01:34:38,733 --> 01:34:50,713
So like the policy process process or to resources and like you know investing and also regarding its real life resources in this war.

746
01:34:52,643 --> 01:35:00,373
Well then yeah, people were really trying to get attention also taking ideas.

747
01:35:00,813 --> 01:35:10,183
So it's like nothing but making policies could be really different because it is so complicated and everything is involved in this.

748
01:35:10,203 --> 01:35:16,153
Like you can see about money disparities and regular people kind of have access to.

749
01:35:17,053 --> 01:35:26,442
It's so much fun because you are going to have to start off by saying, Hey, what about you?

750
01:35:26,443 --> 01:35:36,763
And your Internet is enhancing your happiness and supporting us to go hydrous and come back to you as semester

751
01:35:36,773 --> 01:35:47,113
project in the pharmacy for my class and I are trying to find that and relationship of the caregivers

752
01:35:47,113 --> 01:35:57,753
with patients and their and and to find whether they should be the fact that this video from issue and

753
01:35:57,973 --> 01:36:06,013
membership code behavior and even higher cognitive function and substance abuse who has the emotion.

754
01:36:06,223 --> 01:36:15,372
Yeah and when I used to June and immediately I found that yeah it may really have

755
01:36:15,373 --> 01:36:24,163
some difference because there is a difference in the definitions of caregivers.

756
01:36:24,163 --> 01:36:35,413
Right. Some some caregivers like spouse or close related things can give a cane, can perceive some findings,

757
01:36:35,413 --> 01:36:44,093
but not others like friends or or since Grinch trials or in or out of their homes.

758
01:36:44,113 --> 01:36:53,623
Yeah so agree and so they may not well really willing to do more about their caregiving work.

759
01:36:54,913 --> 01:37:05,393
I believe that's really it's of how they take care of their patients matters more how should they work here be something

760
01:37:05,413 --> 01:37:14,352
I think that you're about to bring up in the policy for you for listening to try easier rather than one tell was

761
01:37:14,353 --> 01:37:20,353
getting organized to write it down and to make a point and to reach out to the policymakers and decision makers that

762
01:37:20,353 --> 01:37:27,703
have really big cities and have a sense of what I want you to do and this is why you have to do that in the yeah,

763
01:37:27,733 --> 01:37:39,553
I think about that now and once in a while you can just imagine like, you know, because before we have policies to support caregivers,

764
01:37:39,583 --> 01:37:48,403
we don't even know that if we had this kind of policies, we were ignoring some particular groups like the Grand or something like that.

765
01:37:48,723 --> 01:37:59,292
As we do this and we find that there are still some limitations and this is kind of progress step by step or you have

766
01:37:59,293 --> 01:38:09,913
to start to this and then your friends and there are more things that we could improve as you guys try and trails.

767
01:38:09,913 --> 01:38:13,782
That's how something like that was not pretty there.

768
01:38:13,783 --> 01:38:17,133
I didn't receive that last semester.

769
01:38:17,143 --> 01:38:21,403
We have to. So about 5000 houses.

770
01:38:21,943 --> 01:38:27,603
And we'll get that because I learned a lot of art and some general concepts like law

771
01:38:27,613 --> 01:38:33,733
house houses because I just came at that time out of fear and I not seeing a lot of U.S.

772
01:38:33,733 --> 01:38:42,422
government and the policies that I have based on the introduction to this new system and

773
01:38:42,423 --> 01:38:47,263
to the U.S. And it's pretty interesting to learn some different different policy systems.

774
01:38:48,163 --> 01:38:54,092
And. Oh, and armed forces follow families so that we kind of place something like that.

775
01:38:54,093 --> 01:39:04,353
No one's real good. Yeah, but it's like a jewelry for your mental impulse after the event for ourselves.

776
01:39:04,383 --> 01:39:14,033
But if a house has so, it can help secure more funding for me to deal with the pandemic so easily.

777
01:39:14,523 --> 01:39:19,243
Yeah, it sounds like this idea is quite an interesting insight and I certainly understand what.

778
01:39:19,853 --> 01:39:29,983
Some has never done. So I'm someone who is guilty of this kind of research and are know trying to make sense of it all.

779
01:39:32,443 --> 01:39:40,553
And especially competition and the. I don't know because I want to know where I am.

780
01:39:40,563 --> 01:39:49,513
Mean, it's like you have to search for the settings that who are responsible for this kind of particular position.

781
01:39:49,533 --> 01:39:55,773
Like we have one idea for that project is just search, you know, like if I want to,

782
01:39:55,803 --> 01:40:02,103
I want to see the awesome organization in Michigan and I will search for like who is senior at

783
01:40:02,403 --> 01:40:09,463
Michigan State that are responsible for this particular House issue because different standards.

784
01:40:09,483 --> 01:40:13,442
They are responsible for different kind of topics.

785
01:40:13,443 --> 01:40:16,713
Yeah. Like somebody are responsible for mental health.

786
01:40:16,713 --> 01:40:20,423
Somebody are responsible. Drinking water quality is about.

787
01:40:20,683 --> 01:40:26,763
Yeah. So it's pretty interesting to me that there's a lot of things that you need to obviously, you know,

788
01:40:28,803 --> 01:40:35,913
how like if you want to appeal, what is what kind of examples you're going to use, right?

789
01:40:36,093 --> 01:40:39,303
Yeah. And sometimes even sometimes good. Yeah.

790
01:40:39,303 --> 01:40:42,393
It sounds about right obviously something like.

791
01:40:42,743 --> 01:40:48,543
Yeah, it's pretty interesting. Yeah. And I yeah and yeah.

792
01:40:49,053 --> 01:40:52,143
Possibly. Yeah. Yeah.

793
01:40:52,323 --> 01:40:59,643
But making a difference is. I thought I found it.

794
01:41:00,483 --> 01:41:08,843
It is very new to study policy about a House policy in America because they pile on there.

795
01:41:09,543 --> 01:41:19,083
We are all applying that and national White House is saying and not really from their the media allies with our contributors.

796
01:41:19,413 --> 01:41:30,353
Right. And they are we are trying are trying to build a long term care issues, so to speak.

797
01:41:31,083 --> 01:41:34,563
It's really a different thing for the country.

798
01:41:34,883 --> 01:41:37,973
Yeah, yeah.

799
01:41:38,013 --> 01:41:42,763
Same in China. It's like we have one single insurance.

800
01:41:42,763 --> 01:41:46,592
This and our way of seeing that work is there is no.

801
01:41:46,593 --> 01:41:55,173
You never know what to say. Yeah. It's like, you know, it's two different methods Medicaid and Medicare.

802
01:41:59,103 --> 01:42:02,813
So there's actually people that are just hired, right?

803
01:42:03,063 --> 01:42:13,603
And they don't have the right person and always they are eligible for one insurance program is now eligible for all of them.

804
01:42:13,863 --> 01:42:27,473
So what do you do eligible? What is it that you are that you say and you have to go and I.

805
01:42:37,293 --> 01:42:46,983
Are you just wanting to quickly wrap up and see if we have any one would like to share information from that group or we we

806
01:42:46,983 --> 01:42:52,862
have certainly had a nice conversation up at the front just about the the first finding and what could be driving that,

807
01:42:52,863 --> 01:42:55,713
whether it's methodological or or substantive.

808
01:42:56,463 --> 01:43:04,442
We also talked a lot about, you know, to what extent do we know or how to how to engage in making policy.

809
01:43:04,443 --> 01:43:13,473
So, for example, I have this recent finding that's come out of some work we're doing young adults with physical disabilities across the United States.

810
01:43:13,473 --> 01:43:18,723
And we see that they have access to health, promoting resources in their community.

811
01:43:18,723 --> 01:43:23,883
They're less likely to develop these, you know, age associated conditions like cardiovascular disease.

812
01:43:24,243 --> 01:43:33,513
What's really the most powerful protective thing for people to prevent them from having these comorbid conditions is broadband Internet access.

813
01:43:34,623 --> 01:43:39,363
So for people with disabilities, you know, they can't always get to a health care provider.

814
01:43:39,693 --> 01:43:43,323
And then even the barriers in a clinic prevent them from actually getting care.

815
01:43:43,563 --> 01:43:49,203
But you can with broadband Internet, you can access telemedicine, you can avoid social isolation and loneliness.

816
01:43:49,473 --> 01:43:57,212
So this is important finding. And then I was talking to somebody who was at Robbins Center and they said, you've got to do the policy briefing.

817
01:43:57,213 --> 01:44:01,772
You've got to get it to the decision makers. And I couldn't even tell you and I don't even know how to start.

818
01:44:01,773 --> 01:44:05,763
I didn't even know who the decision makers, who is a policy, what is that?

819
01:44:06,303 --> 01:44:12,903
So it's just I feel like there's so much I don't know and I realize that joshing and helping, you know,

820
01:44:12,903 --> 01:44:18,603
much more even that I know what a policy maker is and had some at least you got some training in it.

821
01:44:20,523 --> 01:44:27,603
Anybody have any other thoughts? And you thought about trying to engage in policymaking and influence decision makers at all?

822
01:44:31,913 --> 01:44:38,443
We kind of talked about that, too. How like, can just anyone write a policy and promote our guys and, you know,

823
01:44:38,453 --> 01:44:43,703
to the legislative branch or whoever, like you said, whoever the policy maker is?

824
01:44:46,043 --> 01:44:53,003
Yeah. So we did do a little bit of parliamentary class last semester, about once a year, but.

825
01:44:54,313 --> 01:44:58,632
Things like that or. Interesting.

826
01:44:58,633 --> 01:45:00,163
I guess that's the kind of thing we're able to just like,

827
01:45:00,163 --> 01:45:05,233
do it once and then you know how it's done and then you can do it again or and encourage others to do it.

828
01:45:07,483 --> 01:45:13,363
I feel like there are many angles that act as a bridge between the public and the government.

829
01:45:13,663 --> 01:45:19,003
I have friends who run this period, organizations, actually.

830
01:45:19,303 --> 01:45:26,922
And then she and she convinced the governor of Michigan to cancel the tax on tenants and feminine products.

831
01:45:26,923 --> 01:45:32,263
So that's the act now. So right now, if you go to markets and you buy tampons, you don't need to pay the tax anymore.

832
01:45:32,593 --> 01:45:41,413
So that's a really good example of how the other females or mostly everyone,

833
01:45:42,043 --> 01:45:47,833
they sign something and then the NGO and they connect the governor and then

834
01:45:48,283 --> 01:45:53,803
propose to her and then she and her group will decide and then make a decision.

835
01:45:54,463 --> 01:46:02,323
So I think that terms I talked about, you read your stories and I think when you read your stories, you need someone to organize all of the stories.

836
01:46:02,323 --> 01:46:05,743
And in present on you don't send letters individually. There'll be too many letters.

837
01:46:06,613 --> 01:46:14,653
Yeah. No, I think that's really practical. And the way it probably works best is that there's a person, a middle layer of someone who's trying.
