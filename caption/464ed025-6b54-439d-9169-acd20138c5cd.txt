00:00:09,290 --> 00:00:11,790
Hey, it's Matt Zawistowski.

2
00:00:11,790 --> 00:00:13,650
In this lecture, we're
going to talk about

3
00:00:13,650 --> 00:00:16,020
graphical techniques
for longitudinal data.

4
00:00:16,020 --> 00:00:17,310
Before we begin, it's

5
00:00:17,310 --> 00:00:19,020
important to think about
what we are trying to

6
00:00:19,020 --> 00:00:22,380
accomplish during a
longitudinal data analysis.

7
00:00:22,380 --> 00:00:25,050
Our main objective is
usually to understand how

8
00:00:25,050 --> 00:00:28,110
the outcome changes over
time within individuals,

9
00:00:28,110 --> 00:00:30,330
and to identify
differences between

10
00:00:30,330 --> 00:00:33,405
individuals that explain
differences in the outcome.

11
00:00:33,405 --> 00:00:35,970
In this lecture, we'll
take a first shot at

12
00:00:35,970 --> 00:00:38,895
addressing these objectives
using graphical analysis.

13
00:00:38,895 --> 00:00:42,240
A critical step in any
good data analysis.

14
00:00:42,240 --> 00:00:44,150
As the saying goes,

15
00:00:44,150 --> 00:00:46,525
a picture is worth 1000 words,

16
00:00:46,525 --> 00:00:49,040
and a good figure or
plot can be incredibly

17
00:00:49,040 --> 00:00:52,040
helpful for identifying
patterns in your data.

18
00:00:52,040 --> 00:00:54,020
Data visualization can be used

19
00:00:54,020 --> 00:00:55,820
to spot potential outliers,

20
00:00:55,820 --> 00:00:58,450
and observe relationships
between variables.

21
00:00:58,450 --> 00:01:00,140
It can also help
us to think about

22
00:01:00,140 --> 00:01:02,315
the next step in
our data analysis.

23
00:01:02,315 --> 00:01:04,180
What models are
appropriate to use,

24
00:01:04,180 --> 00:01:05,810
and how likely the assumptions

25
00:01:05,810 --> 00:01:08,135
for those models are to be met.

26
00:01:08,135 --> 00:01:11,390
We'll start by thinking
about how we typically

27
00:01:11,390 --> 00:01:14,375
graph data containing
a numerical outcome.

28
00:01:14,375 --> 00:01:16,820
The scatter plot is
an informative way of

29
00:01:16,820 --> 00:01:19,405
showing the relationship
between a numerical outcome,

30
00:01:19,405 --> 00:01:22,189
and a numerical
covariate, or exposure.

31
00:01:22,189 --> 00:01:25,310
In longitudinal analysis,
our covariate is

32
00:01:25,310 --> 00:01:28,675
some measure of time and
therefore a numerical variable.

33
00:01:28,675 --> 00:01:30,920
With scatterplot
would make sense,

34
00:01:30,920 --> 00:01:32,540
but it's missing a key piece of

35
00:01:32,540 --> 00:01:35,765
additional information
contained in longitudinal data.

36
00:01:35,765 --> 00:01:39,170
The repeated measure
aspect of the outcomes.

37
00:01:39,170 --> 00:01:41,570
By simply connecting
the dots between

38
00:01:41,570 --> 00:01:43,595
measurements collected
on the same sample,

39
00:01:43,595 --> 00:01:46,400
we unlock temporal
patterns in the data.

40
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:48,590
What previously looked
like a cloud of

41
00:01:48,590 --> 00:01:50,795
points with no real relationship,

42
00:01:50,795 --> 00:01:52,850
now reveals a subtle increase in

43
00:01:52,850 --> 00:01:55,580
the outcome within
individuals over time.

44
00:01:55,580 --> 00:01:58,610
The simple addition of
lines to the scatterplot is

45
00:01:58,610 --> 00:02:00,290
an effective and standard method

46
00:02:00,290 --> 00:02:02,545
to display longitudinal data.

47
00:02:02,545 --> 00:02:04,570
When we plot the measurements,

48
00:02:04,570 --> 00:02:06,575
and connecting lines
for a single sample,

49
00:02:06,575 --> 00:02:08,945
we call this an
individual level curve.

50
00:02:08,945 --> 00:02:11,150
It allows us to
observe the trajectory

51
00:02:11,150 --> 00:02:13,550
of the outcome for
a specific sample.

52
00:02:13,550 --> 00:02:15,980
Individual level curves
can also include

53
00:02:15,980 --> 00:02:18,230
dots at the locations
of the measurements,

54
00:02:18,230 --> 00:02:19,640
which is useful to see when

55
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:22,670
data collection occur for
that particular sample.

56
00:02:22,670 --> 00:02:25,910
We can also begin to answer
important questions.

57
00:02:25,910 --> 00:02:28,220
Do the measurements
change over time?

58
00:02:28,220 --> 00:02:30,935
Do they generally
increase, or decrease?

59
00:02:30,935 --> 00:02:33,145
Are the changes large, or small?

60
00:02:33,145 --> 00:02:35,650
We can also think about
the shape of the change.

61
00:02:35,650 --> 00:02:37,130
Does the outcome increase,

62
00:02:37,130 --> 00:02:39,065
or decrease in a linear fashion?

63
00:02:39,065 --> 00:02:41,030
Or is the change non-linear?

64
00:02:41,030 --> 00:02:43,160
Is the change even monotonic?

65
00:02:43,160 --> 00:02:44,585
Or does the outcome switch from

66
00:02:44,585 --> 00:02:47,075
increasing to
decreasing over time?

67
00:02:47,075 --> 00:02:49,100
These observations are important

68
00:02:49,100 --> 00:02:50,300
for determining the types of

69
00:02:50,300 --> 00:02:52,160
statistical models that would be

70
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:54,695
best for future analysis.

71
00:02:54,695 --> 00:02:56,960
The individual level curves are

72
00:02:56,960 --> 00:02:59,525
useful for looking at
one sample at a time.

73
00:02:59,525 --> 00:03:03,130
But how about visualizing
the entire cohort?

74
00:03:03,130 --> 00:03:06,200
To do that we use something
called the spaghetti plot,

75
00:03:06,200 --> 00:03:07,820
which shows all the individual

76
00:03:07,820 --> 00:03:09,680
level curves on the same plot.

77
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:11,720
It's called the spaghetti
plot because of

78
00:03:11,720 --> 00:03:14,749
its resemblance to a bowl
of overlapping noodles.

79
00:03:14,749 --> 00:03:16,580
Lines for each sample are

80
00:03:16,580 --> 00:03:18,950
plotted using different
colors or patterns,

81
00:03:18,950 --> 00:03:20,450
and so we can still identify

82
00:03:20,450 --> 00:03:23,180
the trajectory of
individual samples.

83
00:03:23,180 --> 00:03:25,640
The spaghetti plot allows
us to determine if

84
00:03:25,640 --> 00:03:28,190
common patterns exist
within the cohort.

85
00:03:28,190 --> 00:03:30,545
For example, does
the outcome seem to

86
00:03:30,545 --> 00:03:34,264
increase over time for
all or most samples?

87
00:03:34,264 --> 00:03:36,440
The spaghetti plot is also

88
00:03:36,440 --> 00:03:39,200
valuable for
identifying outliers.

89
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:41,840
Remember that outliers are
measurements that differ

90
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:44,465
dramatically from the
remainder of the dataset.

91
00:03:44,465 --> 00:03:46,700
In this example, we can see

92
00:03:46,700 --> 00:03:48,380
one measurement that
is suspiciously

93
00:03:48,380 --> 00:03:50,090
different from
other measurements,

94
00:03:50,090 --> 00:03:53,315
even other measurements,
for that same sample.

95
00:03:53,315 --> 00:03:55,170
For longitudinal data,

96
00:03:55,170 --> 00:03:57,710
an entire subject
can be an outlier,

97
00:03:57,710 --> 00:03:59,330
if its measurements or patterns

98
00:03:59,330 --> 00:04:01,465
strongly differ from all others.

99
00:04:01,465 --> 00:04:03,920
Here, the red line in the figure

100
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:06,080
gives an example of
an outlier sample,

101
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:07,670
for which all of its
measurements are

102
00:04:07,670 --> 00:04:10,670
larger than the other
measurements in the dataset.

103
00:04:10,670 --> 00:04:14,495
Remember, outliers aren't
necessarily bad data.

104
00:04:14,495 --> 00:04:17,030
They're just different, and it is

105
00:04:17,030 --> 00:04:20,315
important to try to determine
why the difference exists.

106
00:04:20,315 --> 00:04:21,950
Knowing this can guide how you

107
00:04:21,950 --> 00:04:24,140
handle an outlier
during analysis,

108
00:04:24,140 --> 00:04:25,940
whether it should be included,

109
00:04:25,940 --> 00:04:28,400
or if it makes
sense to remove it.

110
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:32,110
The spaghetti plot is a
nice 10,000-foot view,

111
00:04:32,110 --> 00:04:35,455
because it allows us to
see all the data at once.

112
00:04:35,455 --> 00:04:37,210
But it can also be challenging

113
00:04:37,210 --> 00:04:39,310
to make definitive
interpretations,

114
00:04:39,310 --> 00:04:41,380
because of the complexity
of the picture

115
00:04:41,380 --> 00:04:44,275
with so many samples
crossing over each other.

116
00:04:44,275 --> 00:04:46,450
A good way to
simplify the pattern

117
00:04:46,450 --> 00:04:48,460
is to plot the mean
response curve,

118
00:04:48,460 --> 00:04:50,515
which is the mean
value of the outcome

119
00:04:50,515 --> 00:04:53,545
across all samples at
given time points.

120
00:04:53,545 --> 00:04:56,995
The black line is the mean
response curve for these data.

121
00:04:56,995 --> 00:04:59,620
With the black dots
giving the mean value of

122
00:04:59,620 --> 00:05:03,370
the outcome across all samples
at the indicated times.

123
00:05:03,370 --> 00:05:05,830
The mean response curve
can help to answer

124
00:05:05,830 --> 00:05:08,590
questions about general
patterns in the data,

125
00:05:08,590 --> 00:05:10,300
regarding change over time,

126
00:05:10,300 --> 00:05:11,905
in the form of the change.

127
00:05:11,905 --> 00:05:14,360
For example, does the
outcome appear to

128
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:17,980
increase approximately
linearly with time?

129
00:05:17,980 --> 00:05:20,885
When longitudinal
data is balanced,

130
00:05:20,885 --> 00:05:23,560
making the mean response
curve is straightforward.

131
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:25,600
You just compute the mean outcome

132
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:27,560
at the common collection times.

133
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:29,530
Unbalanced data presents a bit of

134
00:05:29,530 --> 00:05:31,270
a technical challenge because

135
00:05:31,270 --> 00:05:34,375
the measurement times
differ across the samples.

136
00:05:34,375 --> 00:05:38,020
A good solution is to create
non-overlapping bins of

137
00:05:38,020 --> 00:05:39,965
time and compute the mean for

138
00:05:39,965 --> 00:05:42,410
measurements that are
taken within the bins.

139
00:05:42,410 --> 00:05:44,555
Using this plotting
technique provides

140
00:05:44,555 --> 00:05:48,215
a good graphical summary
for unbalanced data.

141
00:05:48,215 --> 00:05:50,980
Now, remember what
our objectives are

142
00:05:50,980 --> 00:05:53,500
for a longitudinal data analysis.

143
00:05:53,500 --> 00:05:55,450
First, we want to understand

144
00:05:55,450 --> 00:05:57,800
the changes in the
outcome over time.

145
00:05:57,800 --> 00:06:00,580
The individual level curves
and spaghetti plots do

146
00:06:00,580 --> 00:06:03,685
a great job of visually
accomplishing that goal.

147
00:06:03,685 --> 00:06:05,200
We also want to determine

148
00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:07,960
variables that affect
the change in outcome.

149
00:06:07,960 --> 00:06:11,110
An effective technique
to do that is to color

150
00:06:11,110 --> 00:06:13,120
the individual lines according to

151
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:15,950
different levels of a
variable of interest.

152
00:06:15,950 --> 00:06:17,470
In the example shown,

153
00:06:17,470 --> 00:06:19,840
coloring the lines red
and blue effectively

154
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:23,289
differentiates subjects
based on a binary variable.

155
00:06:23,289 --> 00:06:25,840
Doing so allows us to
see that subjects in

156
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:27,305
the red group tend to have

157
00:06:27,305 --> 00:06:30,035
higher measurements than
subjects in the blue group.

158
00:06:30,035 --> 00:06:33,160
If there are more than two
options for a variable,

159
00:06:33,160 --> 00:06:36,380
we can just use more colors
to distinguish them.

160
00:06:36,380 --> 00:06:40,110
We can further evaluate
differences between the groups by

161
00:06:40,110 --> 00:06:44,130
computing and plotting
group-level mean response curves.

162
00:06:44,130 --> 00:06:46,560
This simple plotting
technique allows us to

163
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:48,810
directly compare
average measurements

164
00:06:48,810 --> 00:06:50,040
between the groups over

165
00:06:50,040 --> 00:06:53,645
time and we can observe how
different the groups are,

166
00:06:53,645 --> 00:06:56,230
whether the change
is constant and even

167
00:06:56,230 --> 00:06:59,635
whether profile of change is
similar in the two groups.

168
00:06:59,635 --> 00:07:01,570
These types of observations will

169
00:07:01,570 --> 00:07:03,160
be useful later when we are

170
00:07:03,160 --> 00:07:05,320
determining appropriate
statistical models

171
00:07:05,320 --> 00:07:07,075
to fit to the data.

172
00:07:07,075 --> 00:07:09,100
Now we're going to focus on

173
00:07:09,100 --> 00:07:12,190
a different type of plot
for longitudinal data.

174
00:07:12,190 --> 00:07:14,410
Remember that the
defining feature

175
00:07:14,410 --> 00:07:16,240
of the repeated
measures design is

176
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:18,220
the dependence or
correlation between

177
00:07:18,220 --> 00:07:20,575
measurements collected
on the same sample.

178
00:07:20,575 --> 00:07:22,810
We are now going to
think about how we can

179
00:07:22,810 --> 00:07:25,795
plot the data to visualize
this correlation.

180
00:07:25,795 --> 00:07:28,810
First, consider just
two time points.

181
00:07:28,810 --> 00:07:30,490
We can plot these data using

182
00:07:30,490 --> 00:07:32,740
a scatter plot with the
first-time point along

183
00:07:32,740 --> 00:07:36,955
the x-axis and the second
time point along the y-axis.

184
00:07:36,955 --> 00:07:38,950
The resulting scatter plot now

185
00:07:38,950 --> 00:07:40,595
displays the relationship between

186
00:07:40,595 --> 00:07:42,235
measurements taken on samples

187
00:07:42,235 --> 00:07:44,585
at the first two time points.

188
00:07:44,585 --> 00:07:46,960
We interpret these plots the same

189
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:49,450
way we would interpret
any scatter plot.

190
00:07:49,450 --> 00:07:52,295
If dots form a pattern
lists cloud then

191
00:07:52,295 --> 00:07:55,285
the outcome at the two time
points are not correlated.

192
00:07:55,285 --> 00:07:57,630
Alternatively, if
we see a pattern of

193
00:07:57,630 --> 00:07:59,765
points increasing
from left to right,

194
00:07:59,765 --> 00:08:02,014
it indicates positive
correlation.

195
00:08:02,014 --> 00:08:04,060
This is the pattern
we expect to see

196
00:08:04,060 --> 00:08:06,520
when plotting repeated
measures data because

197
00:08:06,520 --> 00:08:08,470
measurements on the
same sample are more

198
00:08:08,470 --> 00:08:11,570
similar than measurements
between different samples.

199
00:08:11,570 --> 00:08:15,545
A pattern of dots decreasing
from left to right indicates

200
00:08:15,545 --> 00:08:17,320
negative correlation and it's

201
00:08:17,320 --> 00:08:20,405
typically not seen in
repeated measure data.

202
00:08:20,405 --> 00:08:23,830
We can easily extend
this basic idea of

203
00:08:23,830 --> 00:08:26,675
visualizing correlation
at two time points to

204
00:08:26,675 --> 00:08:28,570
visualize and correlation across

205
00:08:28,570 --> 00:08:32,590
all time points by creating
a correlation matrix.

206
00:08:32,590 --> 00:08:36,580
The correlation matrix consists
of scatter plots showing

207
00:08:36,580 --> 00:08:38,575
within sample correlation at

208
00:08:38,575 --> 00:08:40,885
all combinations of time points.

209
00:08:40,885 --> 00:08:42,935
With the correlation matrix,

210
00:08:42,935 --> 00:08:45,605
we can observe the
direction and strength of

211
00:08:45,605 --> 00:08:47,520
correlation and examine how

212
00:08:47,520 --> 00:08:50,120
it potentially changes over time.

213
00:08:50,120 --> 00:08:52,120
In this example, we are looking

214
00:08:52,120 --> 00:08:53,670
at the correlation matrix for

215
00:08:53,670 --> 00:08:57,735
balanced longitudinal data
collected at four time points.

216
00:08:57,735 --> 00:09:00,010
The boxes highlighted in red show

217
00:09:00,010 --> 00:09:01,210
the correlation between

218
00:09:01,210 --> 00:09:03,475
measurements one-time
point apart.

219
00:09:03,475 --> 00:09:06,595
For example, between
collection times 1 and 2,

220
00:09:06,595 --> 00:09:08,945
2 and 3, and 3 and 4.

221
00:09:08,945 --> 00:09:11,285
In each, we can see
that the outcomes

222
00:09:11,285 --> 00:09:14,435
have reasonably strong
positive correlation.

223
00:09:14,435 --> 00:09:17,410
If we shift focus to
measurements two-time points

224
00:09:17,410 --> 00:09:20,330
away between collection
times 1 and 3,

225
00:09:20,330 --> 00:09:22,085
and 3 and 4, we see

226
00:09:22,085 --> 00:09:23,880
that the measurements
are still positively

227
00:09:23,880 --> 00:09:25,570
correlated but the strength of

228
00:09:25,570 --> 00:09:28,155
the correlation has
degraded somewhat.

229
00:09:28,155 --> 00:09:30,190
Finally, when we look at

230
00:09:30,190 --> 00:09:31,840
the correlation of
measurements that are

231
00:09:31,840 --> 00:09:36,290
three time points apart between
collection times 1 and 4,

232
00:09:36,290 --> 00:09:38,170
the correlation has
degrade it to where

233
00:09:38,170 --> 00:09:40,610
the measurements are
almost uncorrelated.

234
00:09:40,610 --> 00:09:42,955
Of course, this is
just an example,

235
00:09:42,955 --> 00:09:45,235
but it shows a fairly
common phenomenon

236
00:09:45,235 --> 00:09:46,705
for longitudinal data,

237
00:09:46,705 --> 00:09:48,725
that the correlation
between measurements

238
00:09:48,725 --> 00:09:51,845
decreases the further apart
the measurements are taken.

239
00:09:51,845 --> 00:09:55,105
In many cases, this makes
good intuitive sense.

240
00:09:55,105 --> 00:09:57,755
As more time elapses
between measurements,

241
00:09:57,755 --> 00:10:01,060
we would expect the measurements
to be less similar.

242
00:10:01,060 --> 00:10:04,420
We now have our first set
of tools for analyzing

243
00:10:04,420 --> 00:10:07,914
repeated measures data
from longitudinal studies.

244
00:10:07,914 --> 00:10:09,875
These plotting
techniques allow us

245
00:10:09,875 --> 00:10:11,470
to visualize numerous patterns in

246
00:10:11,470 --> 00:10:12,565
the data from

247
00:10:12,565 --> 00:10:15,715
individual and group level
changes in the outcome,

248
00:10:15,715 --> 00:10:19,170
identifying outlier
measurements and determining

249
00:10:19,170 --> 00:10:21,310
the strength within
sample correlation

250
00:10:21,310 --> 00:10:23,200
for the repeated measures.

251
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:25,555
Armed with just these plots,

252
00:10:25,555 --> 00:10:27,575
we already have a
pretty good start

253
00:10:27,575 --> 00:10:31,168
to analyze in longitudinal data.
