1
00:00:13,932 --> 00:00:17,245
Another phase,
standard micro economic theory doesn't

2
00:00:17,245 --> 00:00:21,920
often recognizes sort of the impact of
social, cultural and political factors.

3
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:27,382
You've got several points that,
markets are subject to these factors and

4
00:00:27,382 --> 00:00:31,382
that those factors are in
fact influenced by markets.

5
00:00:31,382 --> 00:00:36,258
What are some of the ways in which those
social, cultural and political factors

6
00:00:36,258 --> 00:00:41,307
may change our understanding of markets
and how they work or how they should work?

7
00:00:41,307 --> 00:00:43,618
>> But when is that, the supply and

8
00:00:43,618 --> 00:00:48,766
demand diagram always exists within
a social institutional context?

9
00:00:48,766 --> 00:00:53,081
And there is no such thing as a market
that is outside of the factors that you

10
00:00:53,081 --> 00:00:53,927
identified.

11
00:00:53,927 --> 00:00:58,572
The fact that I pay you money and for
a service that you just can't run off with

12
00:00:58,572 --> 00:01:01,560
the money and
never give me the service implies.

13
00:01:01,560 --> 00:01:06,315
There's a legal regulatory structure
that is undergirding just the fact

14
00:01:06,315 --> 00:01:08,775
that we can have these transactions.

15
00:01:08,775 --> 00:01:13,560
So there's some very obvious
institutional things that matter.

16
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:18,417
But there's also other things, for
example, in terms of cultural factors,

17
00:01:18,417 --> 00:01:23,274
the physicians respond more to economic
incentives than positions will fully

18
00:01:23,274 --> 00:01:25,864
acknowledge will be maybe even aware of.

19
00:01:25,864 --> 00:01:30,170
We know that from a million studies of
doctors that, if you make a certain

20
00:01:30,170 --> 00:01:35,240
activity more profitable for
oncologists, there'll be more of it.

21
00:01:35,240 --> 00:01:42,462
What they will not do is do something
that they believe is harming a patient.

22
00:01:42,462 --> 00:01:46,484
If I can make more money by up coding
something that I send to Medicare or

23
00:01:46,484 --> 00:01:50,864
to a private insurer, it's going to be
a bunch of doctors are going to do that.

24
00:01:50,864 --> 00:01:54,840
If I can make more money by doing
something that harms you as a patient.

25
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:57,658
But many fewer doctors
are going to do that.

26
00:01:57,658 --> 00:02:02,800
And there's a culture of
medicine that says it's okay

27
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:08,870
to be strategic in my interactions
with the insurance company.

28
00:02:08,870 --> 00:02:14,202
It's not okay to be strategic in the same
way in my interactions with a patient,

29
00:02:14,202 --> 00:02:16,758
in a way that would harm that patient.

30
00:02:16,758 --> 00:02:21,636
So understanding the ethics of medical
care is often important just to understand

31
00:02:21,636 --> 00:02:26,102
how our doctor is going to respond to
some of the incentives that they have.

32
00:02:26,102 --> 00:02:29,867
The second thing is to understand
the sociology of organizations.

33
00:02:29,867 --> 00:02:33,342
If you say, what are the incentive
space in the University of

34
00:02:33,342 --> 00:02:36,290
Michigan Hospital if we
change a Medicare policy?

35
00:02:36,290 --> 00:02:38,751
Listen, in some ways,
that's the wrong question,

36
00:02:38,751 --> 00:02:42,040
because the University of
Michigan Hospital is not one thing.

37
00:02:42,040 --> 00:02:47,226
It's got a cancer center,
it's got an emergency department,

38
00:02:47,226 --> 00:02:49,538
it's got a surgical units.

39
00:02:49,538 --> 00:02:55,076
It's a whole set of sub organizations
that interact with each other.

40
00:02:55,076 --> 00:02:58,418
And the hospital can't always
act as a unified actor.

41
00:02:58,418 --> 00:03:03,360
If you're going to be making
Medicare policy towards hospitals,

42
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:06,361
you have to understand a little bit about

43
00:03:06,361 --> 00:03:11,050
how hospitals work in terms of
the organizational sociology.

44
00:03:11,050 --> 00:03:14,585
One of the weaknesses of
economics is very often we don't

45
00:03:14,585 --> 00:03:19,227
have the same level of granularity
when we study big organizations that's

46
00:03:19,227 --> 00:03:22,041
an organizational sociologist would have.

47
00:03:22,041 --> 00:03:26,989
And very often the concrete incentives
that the oncology surgeon faces in

48
00:03:26,989 --> 00:03:29,957
the hospital are not
what we think they are.

49
00:03:29,957 --> 00:03:34,700
Because we don't actually understand
how she's really interacting with

50
00:03:34,700 --> 00:03:36,957
the other parts of the hospital a and

51
00:03:36,957 --> 00:03:41,789
what her economic interests really
are in this complicated organization.

52
00:03:41,789 --> 00:03:42,501
I'll stop there.

53
00:03:42,501 --> 00:03:45,008
>> Okay, right along the same lines.

54
00:03:45,008 --> 00:03:49,276
So, what different societies
expect from markets matter?

55
00:03:49,276 --> 00:03:53,481
One example might be what Americans
expect from corporations and

56
00:03:53,481 --> 00:03:57,840
what Europeans expect from corporations
is thought to be different

57
00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:02,289
in terms of what's the responsibility
of a corporation to society?

58
00:04:02,289 --> 00:04:07,142
>> Great question, and
I think I will speak at a level of

59
00:04:07,142 --> 00:04:12,550
generality that that doesn't
fully honor the complexity

60
00:04:12,550 --> 00:04:17,978
of Europe is a big place,
the United States is a big place.

61
00:04:17,978 --> 00:04:22,596
But I think COVID has given some
interesting contrasts between the two

62
00:04:22,596 --> 00:04:26,595
approaches and it's the strengths and
weaknesses of both.

63
00:04:26,595 --> 00:04:30,641
I think Americans were more comfortable
with the idea that you give big

64
00:04:30,641 --> 00:04:34,826
pharmaceutical companies a huge
economic incentive to develop, say,

65
00:04:34,826 --> 00:04:35,867
a COVID vaccine.

66
00:04:35,867 --> 00:04:38,671
They developed a vaccine,
they make a ton of money,

67
00:04:38,671 --> 00:04:42,640
people get vaccinated quickly and
everybody's happy.

68
00:04:42,640 --> 00:04:47,440
And the fact that Pfizer might
make $50 billion COVID vaccine is

69
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:52,152
a price worth paying, if we get
a COVID vaccine six months earlier

70
00:04:52,152 --> 00:04:57,057
than we would have gotten it,
given that we're facing a pandemic.

71
00:04:57,057 --> 00:05:01,653
And I think Europeans are more
ambivalent about that and

72
00:05:01,653 --> 00:05:05,088
about the power of corporations in that.

73
00:05:05,088 --> 00:05:10,304
And I think the European vaccine response
was probably damaged because probably

74
00:05:10,304 --> 00:05:15,297
they had collective action problems
across different European countries.

75
00:05:15,297 --> 00:05:20,265
But I think they were fundamentally more
ambivalent about the high profit margins

76
00:05:20,265 --> 00:05:23,460
that pharmaceutical
companies might have made.

77
00:05:23,460 --> 00:05:28,098
Now the other side of it is that Europeans
tend to have a stronger sense of social

78
00:05:28,098 --> 00:05:30,289
solidarity and social provisions.

79
00:05:30,289 --> 00:05:35,408
And so the United States are social
insurance programs really suffer in

80
00:05:35,408 --> 00:05:41,039
providing help to Americans with medical
vulnerabilities staying paying for

81
00:05:41,039 --> 00:05:43,613
that super expensive medication.

82
00:05:43,613 --> 00:05:47,902
So we have wonderful HIV drugs and
creating a situation where people could

83
00:05:47,902 --> 00:05:50,817
actually get access to
them has been a challenge.

84
00:05:50,817 --> 00:05:55,180
Because we have a less extensive welfare
state than European countries do.

85
00:05:55,180 --> 00:05:59,813
And there are many ways in which if
you are a person with economic or

86
00:05:59,813 --> 00:06:05,123
social vulnerability, the European
welfare states will protect you from

87
00:06:05,123 --> 00:06:10,365
some of the corporate behaviors that
would harm you in the United States.

88
00:06:10,365 --> 00:06:15,971
Because we don't have the money to
afford the things that you need.

89
00:06:15,971 --> 00:06:16,954
Is that the help?

90
00:06:16,954 --> 00:06:17,957
>> Yeah, that's great.

91
00:06:17,957 --> 00:06:24,684
So just to wrap up, how your students
responded to the index card?

92
00:06:24,684 --> 00:06:27,166
>> I think they appreciate it.

93
00:06:27,166 --> 00:06:30,357
I think my students are very
suspicious of economics.

94
00:06:30,357 --> 00:06:36,661
And they see it as a Neo
liberal construct that brings

95
00:06:36,661 --> 00:06:42,640
in a lot of ideological
baggage in the graphs.

96
00:06:42,640 --> 00:06:46,290
And I think one of the things that they
appreciate about the index card is that we

97
00:06:46,290 --> 00:06:49,069
acknowledge with some humility
that economics is useful.

98
00:06:49,069 --> 00:06:53,728
But it's imperfect and that even
as an enterprise and understanding

99
00:06:53,728 --> 00:06:59,843
microeconomics, we have to bring in those
social, cultural, legal, ethical issues.

100
00:06:59,843 --> 00:07:03,418
And I think increasingly, especially
the current generation of students,

101
00:07:03,418 --> 00:07:05,520
they want to see us show
an awareness of that.

102
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:11,625
And so the parts of the card that speaks
to the need to get beyond this simple

103
00:07:11,625 --> 00:07:17,452
graphs on the chalkboard of my
students greatly greatly appreciate.

104
00:07:17,452 --> 00:07:21,440
Well, I think that's been the most
successful aspect of that.

105
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:23,515
I'm curious how your
students respond as well.

106
00:07:23,515 --> 00:07:27,125
>> Okay, I'll certainly let you know.

107
00:07:27,125 --> 00:07:30,990
Thank you, Harold,
it's been a great conversation and

108
00:07:30,990 --> 00:07:34,222
I think students will
truly enjoy seeing this.

109
00:07:34,222 --> 00:07:34,961
>> Great to talk to you.
