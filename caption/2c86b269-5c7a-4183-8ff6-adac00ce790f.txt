1
00:00:04,510 --> 00:00:11,080
All right, good morning, everyone. Congratulations to those of you managing the messiness outdoors.

2
00:00:11,080 --> 00:00:13,660
I've actually gotten emails this morning from a couple of students.

3
00:00:13,660 --> 00:00:21,100
We're going to be a smaller class today for various reasons, but a couple of folks aren't able to make it.

4
00:00:21,100 --> 00:00:29,710
Yeah, interestingly enough, I had eyed this particular class session at the beginning of the semester because of what we have involved.

5
00:00:29,710 --> 00:00:33,910
We have kind of two integrative discussion, all type exercises,

6
00:00:33,910 --> 00:00:38,830
and technically we're not really tethered to the computer or the machine or the screen.

7
00:00:38,830 --> 00:00:42,520
So I thought this would be a great chance for us to to have class outdoors.

8
00:00:42,520 --> 00:00:46,690
Right. And enjoy like a lovely fresh air without masks.

9
00:00:46,690 --> 00:00:57,370
Now apologies and best laid plans. So anyway, here we are in the not really warm confines, but at least dry auditorium here.

10
00:00:57,370 --> 00:01:04,810
And our objectives are are twofold. One is the exposure science in the news.

11
00:01:04,810 --> 00:01:08,860
Right. Are kind of second installment of that that we'll do just like we did.

12
00:01:08,860 --> 00:01:10,850
The first one will break up into groups.

13
00:01:10,850 --> 00:01:19,630
Each of you will have kind of five minutes to go through and talk about your article and then we'll kind of reconvene and report out,

14
00:01:19,630 --> 00:01:28,420
maybe kind of like the most interesting article from your group in the and the other part of class.

15
00:01:28,420 --> 00:01:34,960
We'll do a different type of integrative exercise where we'll still break out into groups,

16
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:44,710
but a little bit of applying what we've learned so far around identifying and classifying types of hazards with their path,

17
00:01:44,710 --> 00:01:52,180
with their exposure roots, are their exposure pathways, the roots of exposure and getting a little bit ahead of the material,

18
00:01:52,180 --> 00:01:57,910
but begin to think about how we might assess exposure in some of those examples settings.

19
00:01:57,910 --> 00:02:02,440
All right. So I'm going to count off here. We have four, eight, nine.

20
00:02:02,440 --> 00:02:09,550
So to the extent possible, let's try groups of three to start with.

21
00:02:09,550 --> 00:02:16,720
And again, trying to do it so that the minimum number of you need to actually move to accommodate that.

22
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:20,770
So maybe maybe the three of you over here, maybe the three of you up here,

23
00:02:20,770 --> 00:02:30,280
and then if you wouldn't mind moving and joining the two up here, let's start with our exposure science in the news article.

24
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:33,820
So that'll be about 15 minutes, right? Rotating through through three of you.

25
00:02:33,820 --> 00:02:37,920
And then we'll reconvene once you're situated. Go ahead and get started.

26
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:41,710
I'll I'll chime in with those, you know, kind of quick reminders like, hey, it's been five minutes.

27
00:02:41,710 --> 00:02:44,950
Go ahead and move on to the next person. Ready, set.

28
00:02:44,950 --> 00:02:59,997
Go. The plan is very simple.

29
00:03:02,169 --> 00:03:05,799
OK, cool. Thank you so much.

30
00:03:05,799 --> 00:03:13,029
So, yeah. So as part of sharing your articles, hopefully you're able to decide on what might be the most,

31
00:03:13,029 --> 00:03:18,879
I don't know, exciting, interesting, relevant, maybe depressing. Who knows for a variety of reasons.

32
00:03:18,879 --> 00:03:27,339
Issued a report out to the class. So let's start from your left to right going across and start with this group over here.

33
00:03:27,339 --> 00:03:36,889
I think. So my headline was a link between the two hours when.

34
00:03:36,889 --> 00:03:44,169
And it was a memorable one by one and some background is I inherited a long association plan

35
00:03:44,169 --> 00:03:51,469
and the guys that a lot of soldiers and civilians in front of us and one of the politics,

36
00:03:51,469 --> 00:03:59,669
and they're trying to get it done, whether it's through American national standards, that's going to happen.

37
00:03:59,669 --> 00:04:07,189
And that's something they're trying to get a new test done for testing aluminum cans and water.

38
00:04:07,189 --> 00:04:18,259
And so they were blowing past like all the more like amounts of like there are far more international terrorists within the local watershed.

39
00:04:18,259 --> 00:04:28,879
So they're trying to get the by available and that's certified and being able to have these as the baseline set of like the chemicals and the like.

40
00:04:28,879 --> 00:04:33,499
The science is based on fear that something has to be OK.

41
00:04:33,499 --> 00:04:40,039
This I don't know how very well, you know, a lot of them have not been raised with water and what kind of way.

42
00:04:40,039 --> 00:04:42,139
How about the infrastructure?

43
00:04:42,139 --> 00:04:50,509
But and so the argument, I guess there's a problem by actually having all the sanctuary around it, just like the brother.

44
00:04:50,509 --> 00:05:01,129
I mean, that was what then? And so they said more than a decade ago they started playing ball is different from

45
00:05:01,129 --> 00:05:07,279
seemed to start having some issues and security issues and advantages over the process,

46
00:05:07,279 --> 00:05:10,729
which so far hasn't played much for in the water.

47
00:05:10,729 --> 00:05:15,019
And they're not about to go on for in any way.

48
00:05:15,019 --> 00:05:23,549
Much more on of that. And so they examined all of this in order to accommodate such bad conditions and.

49
00:05:23,549 --> 00:05:33,499
He said and the doctor said, this happens when you take fluoride, which is much more, I guess,

50
00:05:33,499 --> 00:05:40,429
incorporated in the mineralization volume instead of the random testing through water for the bodies.

51
00:05:40,429 --> 00:05:43,649
And so I try to find misfold minutes or more.

52
00:05:43,649 --> 00:05:55,829
I don't really find it early aerosolized or gas fluoride for 2.5 grams per cubic meter, but it might be the actual water downstream.

53
00:05:55,829 --> 00:06:09,209
And the fact about fluoride during the week is something that has to do with whether or not coke, you know.

54
00:06:09,209 --> 00:06:19,809
And yeah, it's absolutely normal for us is something for us as manifestations such as gastrointestinal and.

55
00:06:19,809 --> 00:06:28,619
So not good for all those billions and billions of dollars.

56
00:06:28,619 --> 00:06:33,779
Excellent. Thank you so much for sharing and then not to put you directly on the spot.

57
00:06:33,779 --> 00:06:41,459
I'm going to open this up to the class, but part of the assignment was to, if I can recall, identify the type of hazard.

58
00:06:41,459 --> 00:06:52,319
Right. Biological, chemical, physical, identify what the likely exposure pathways are and what the roots of exposure of concern would be.

59
00:06:52,319 --> 00:07:01,169
So in the case of the article that Josh just shared, what would be the the type of hazard?

60
00:07:01,169 --> 00:07:08,789
You know, be comfortable and there are a lot of people, all of these.

61
00:07:08,789 --> 00:07:20,879
And obviously, soldiers at all, in terms of what you're saying is more than like, OK.

62
00:07:20,879 --> 00:07:24,449
So thanks, Sean. So let's see, going back to the start. Yes, absolutely.

63
00:07:24,449 --> 00:07:36,269
With with aluminum or its byproducts, chemical exposures on the main concern in terms of the route of exposure.

64
00:07:36,269 --> 00:07:45,059
So how it could be getting into the body, this would be likely through ingestion or that would certainly be a plausible one.

65
00:07:45,059 --> 00:07:50,609
The last part about exposure pathways, it's not the pathway within the body,

66
00:07:50,609 --> 00:07:55,919
it's the pathway in the environment, kind of the environmental media that, you know from the source.

67
00:07:55,919 --> 00:08:06,209
How was it getting to the point where someone could be exposed? So in that context, what would be the exposure pathway to water?

68
00:08:06,209 --> 00:08:12,059
So these are good examples, right? So it could be through with your groundwater. Could be through through soil contamination.

69
00:08:12,059 --> 00:08:16,469
Excellent. OK, cool. Thanks again so much for sharing and for your answers.

70
00:08:16,469 --> 00:08:32,109
Let's go ahead and move to the group here in the middle. An article on.

71
00:08:32,109 --> 00:08:36,459
Approximately the same age, why not?

72
00:08:36,459 --> 00:08:46,039
Are there any other more sort of services for your.

73
00:08:46,039 --> 00:09:02,429
Firefighting foam from the. I just got into the river and that was the problem that they tested by the water.

74
00:09:02,429 --> 00:09:14,179
And a lot of people like Tony. Even though they have the.

75
00:09:14,179 --> 00:09:21,219
They haven't done that. So they're starting line after the.

76
00:09:21,219 --> 00:09:38,139
It's kind of. Just sort of.

77
00:09:38,139 --> 00:09:50,589
Yeah, and a lot harder to manage, right, getting through to the the water system that's been distributed to everyone is household by household, right?

78
00:09:50,589 --> 00:09:54,409
Well, well, all right. So let's take a step back.

79
00:09:54,409 --> 00:10:01,489
So what's so positive is how concerned are we classifying that?

80
00:10:01,489 --> 00:10:10,989
They kind of got it right, though, and then in terms of exposure pathways, what are we concerned about?

81
00:10:10,989 --> 00:10:18,619
Getting into the water, right, so the well, for sure, and then the route of exposure.

82
00:10:18,619 --> 00:10:23,179
Ingestion would be the primary one. Absolutely. OK, thank you so much.

83
00:10:23,179 --> 00:10:37,599
And let's go over here to the last group. So the title is New Research shows that.

84
00:10:37,599 --> 00:10:43,109
And this was done for. Those of.

85
00:10:43,109 --> 00:10:51,439
So it was actually. And this was published in the.

86
00:10:51,439 --> 00:11:00,999
So they're saying that. The U.S. auto companies are causing.

87
00:11:00,999 --> 00:11:12,569
Like rivers and. Fresh water, so it's like systemize is.

88
00:11:12,569 --> 00:11:31,279
So this kind. You know what pesticides can feel like they are being like sales because of like the like in terms of the.

89
00:11:31,279 --> 00:11:40,189
They're still working on the. So the population is like the.

90
00:11:40,189 --> 00:11:53,199
On the water with. Working out of control centers, scientist.

91
00:11:53,199 --> 00:12:02,419
For children. Just like.

92
00:12:02,419 --> 00:12:14,399
So we need to. And just like an overall.

93
00:12:14,399 --> 00:12:24,779
So negotiations for the right kind of.

94
00:12:24,779 --> 00:12:35,159
Constantine. Is No.

95
00:12:35,159 --> 00:12:42,829
Oh, you mean those? So I couldn't say for sure.

96
00:12:42,829 --> 00:12:54,349
I don't know for certain. As I said, the sources say.

97
00:12:54,349 --> 00:13:03,679
And also, if you like, the agency causing you to. And then I supersaurus.

98
00:13:03,679 --> 00:13:17,489
Like a. the. Separately during the explosion, some contact.

99
00:13:17,489 --> 00:13:29,919
And also judge. OK, awesome.

100
00:13:29,919 --> 00:13:37,059
Yeah, and you kind of corrected yourself, I'm not sure if you just misspoke by accident, but the way you stated it at the end was correct.

101
00:13:37,059 --> 00:13:44,739
So the roots of exposure. Right. You may be concerned about dermal skin contact or ingestion and then the exposure pathway.

102
00:13:44,739 --> 00:13:50,919
So these are these are key distinctions, right? They kind of terminology wise, they sound similar to the root of exposure and the exposure pathway,

103
00:13:50,919 --> 00:13:56,829
but they're very different in terms of that that exposure model that we're referencing in the class.

104
00:13:56,829 --> 00:14:01,389
So excellent. And obviously a biological hazard.

105
00:14:01,389 --> 00:14:05,919
Right, that we're concerned about in this case. Excellent. Thank you so much.

106
00:14:05,919 --> 00:14:16,629
All right. So let's switch things up. Uh, you will find this on the canvas.

107
00:14:16,629 --> 00:14:21,099
Uh, let me point you to it. I mean, I'll leave it up here on the screen.

108
00:14:21,099 --> 00:14:30,219
But just so you know, I've got it's hyperlinked, uh, you know, where otherwise the PowerPoint would be for today's class.

109
00:14:30,219 --> 00:14:36,209
So you can download that doc, if that's useful to have it as you're chatting.

110
00:14:36,209 --> 00:14:41,349
What we're going to do next is break up into do some more.

111
00:14:41,349 --> 00:14:47,889
Erman numbers have changed inside of the classroom. One, two, three, four, five.

112
00:14:47,889 --> 00:14:58,659
All right. Actually, I think I'm going to suggest we stay in three groups of four, so for this, actually, no.

113
00:14:58,659 --> 00:15:13,779
Yes. So if you wouldn't mind doing a little bit closer to these three here and in the back, you just came in, if you wouldn't mind coming down, sorry.

114
00:15:13,779 --> 00:15:22,689
If you wouldn't mind coming down and meeting up with this group for the exercise, then we'll at least have groups of four to work through it.

115
00:15:22,689 --> 00:15:27,009
I'm going to say let me do a time check.

116
00:15:27,009 --> 00:15:38,779
Let's allocate about 20, 20 minutes once once we get started and each group is going to be assigned to a population to consider.

117
00:15:38,779 --> 00:15:47,049
And this exercise is around identifying hazards, the exposure pathways, the roots of exposure.

118
00:15:47,049 --> 00:15:51,609
And then, as I alluded to at the beginning, middle class getting a little bit ahead of ourselves in the material.

119
00:15:51,609 --> 00:15:56,769
We're going to start talking about exposure assessment next week,

120
00:15:56,769 --> 00:16:06,309
but go ahead and just jump in with both feet and see how we manage things in terms of the thought and kind of a good introduction to it.

121
00:16:06,309 --> 00:16:15,789
So group number one and again, I'll just stick with this in the classroom, left to right approach will make you all over here, group number one.

122
00:16:15,789 --> 00:16:21,639
And the population that you are concerned about is flight attendants, the group here in the middle.

123
00:16:21,639 --> 00:16:28,539
We'll call you group number two. And your issue is going to be residents living adjacent to a farm.

124
00:16:28,539 --> 00:16:38,349
And then over here, we'll have group number three. Your population of concern is children at a school next to an oil refinery.

125
00:16:38,349 --> 00:16:46,929
And I actually have a really quick slide that I want to show. I've been I think I mentioned early in the semester that there are a handful,

126
00:16:46,929 --> 00:16:52,269
about five students who for various reasons are needing to take the course asynchronously.

127
00:16:52,269 --> 00:17:00,069
And I've been meeting with them once a week for like an hour just to kind of check in, answer questions,

128
00:17:00,069 --> 00:17:05,859
but also have a little bit of a chance for for active participation in some of these class exercises.

129
00:17:05,859 --> 00:17:16,359
So we did this last night and before we got student started, one of the students I asked, OK, so, uh, clearly we don't really in real in reality,

130
00:17:16,359 --> 00:17:22,089
we don't need to worry about children being at a school next to an oil refinery because there aren't schools next to oil refineries.

131
00:17:22,089 --> 00:17:25,839
Right. And I pulled this this morning.

132
00:17:25,839 --> 00:17:30,219
I pulled up a slide. It's not an oil refinery, but hopefully it'll illustrate the point.

133
00:17:30,219 --> 00:17:37,869
I use this slide as part of my kind of self introduction at the very beginning of the semester when I was talking

134
00:17:37,869 --> 00:17:47,259
about my own research over time and work that we were doing here at Salina Elementary School in Dearborn.

135
00:17:47,259 --> 00:17:52,149
So the building that you see in the background here, this red brick, is in fact the elementary school.

136
00:17:52,149 --> 00:17:58,179
You can sort of see the playground structure here, the red and blue, I think it is.

137
00:17:58,179 --> 00:18:09,759
And then kind of like their athletic field here, the green grass. And then, you know, in immediate proximity is a rail yard.

138
00:18:09,759 --> 00:18:23,049
Just beyond that is an iron and steel production facility and then other industry in support of it, literally on top of this elementary school.

139
00:18:23,049 --> 00:18:25,149
So it's it's not an oil refinery.

140
00:18:25,149 --> 00:18:36,039
I can send you I found a actually folks in the department here contributed to a video like a ten minute video that was produced by MLI,

141
00:18:36,039 --> 00:18:47,709
one of the Michigan media local here in the state of Michigan that was focused on the marathon oil refinery, which is about.

142
00:18:47,709 --> 00:18:54,129
Maybe two miles from this site, I'll post that on canvas, you all can check it out.

143
00:18:54,129 --> 00:18:59,829
And actually I'm delinquent in the in the the zoom session we had last night,

144
00:18:59,829 --> 00:19:05,169
one of the students, Ken, posted a cool podcast that I wanted to share with you all.

145
00:19:05,169 --> 00:19:13,869
And I also never followed up Melissa, like earlier, maybe three weeks ago, sent me a podcast around some of the air quality issues.

146
00:19:13,869 --> 00:19:21,279
I'll post all of these and they'll actually be a nice Segway and lead in to our our class session on Tuesday.

147
00:19:21,279 --> 00:19:27,939
So, anyway, this was just trying to give you some photographic documentation that, yes,

148
00:19:27,939 --> 00:19:36,129
these are concerns that there are children at schools in really close proximity to emission sources.

149
00:19:36,129 --> 00:19:47,829
So with that, what what are your tasks? Step one is to identify the following about exposures to your population of concern.

150
00:19:47,829 --> 00:19:49,599
What are the potential hazards?

151
00:19:49,599 --> 00:19:59,799
And again, think broadly, as many as you can come up with for your circumstance with regards to chemical, physical and biological hazards,

152
00:19:59,799 --> 00:20:07,089
identify what those pathways of exposure might be, identify with the roots of exposure you might be most concerned about.

153
00:20:07,089 --> 00:20:14,799
And again, think broadly. And yes, you need to make some perhaps some assumptions about the exact context of your population.

154
00:20:14,799 --> 00:20:22,029
So be creative just to allow yourself to kind of explore as much as possible then for step two.

155
00:20:22,029 --> 00:20:33,789
And this is where you can kind of zero in maybe identify the most important hazard out of whatever you've come up with and focus just on that one,

156
00:20:33,789 --> 00:20:40,599
but try to develop a methodology for how you would assess exposures to that hazard.

157
00:20:40,599 --> 00:20:49,599
So what type of measurements would you make? How would you make the measures along each of the exposure pathways that you've identified?

158
00:20:49,599 --> 00:20:55,929
When would you make the measurements? Where would you make them? On whom, if that's appropriate?

159
00:20:55,929 --> 00:21:02,919
And then what type of exposure metrics would be most of interest for your hazard that you've identified?

160
00:21:02,919 --> 00:21:07,269
Are you looking for an average exposure over a long time period or are you looking

161
00:21:07,269 --> 00:21:12,909
for a peak exposure rate over perhaps a short time period along those lines?

162
00:21:12,909 --> 00:21:17,499
And then we'll finish after this 20 minutes of group work.

163
00:21:17,499 --> 00:21:24,399
We'll finish and have each group kind of report out the results of the approach that you came up with.

164
00:21:24,399 --> 00:21:32,969
Any questions before we get started? Yes.

165
00:21:32,969 --> 00:21:50,399
Of course. Good question, and I'm going to turn this one around and see who has an answer to that question,

166
00:21:50,399 --> 00:22:06,939
what's what are the primary differences between a route of exposure and an exposure pathway that's so companies like.

167
00:22:06,939 --> 00:22:18,469
How is it going, Mr. Are you drinking?

168
00:22:18,469 --> 00:22:27,229
And just. Excellent answer, yes.

169
00:22:27,229 --> 00:22:30,889
So I'm not sure if you caught that, I repeat it for the microphone.

170
00:22:30,889 --> 00:22:42,439
So our exposure pathways are once a contaminant, a hazard is emitted from a source.

171
00:22:42,439 --> 00:22:48,079
How does it actually get to us as people to be able to be in exposure risk in the first place?

172
00:22:48,079 --> 00:22:57,769
Right. So if it's contaminated in well water, that might lead to an exposure risk through ingestion.

173
00:22:57,769 --> 00:23:02,869
We might drink the water from that source that contains the contaminant.

174
00:23:02,869 --> 00:23:06,379
Absolutely. Does that does that help? To clarify your question.

175
00:23:06,379 --> 00:23:14,889
Excellent. Any other questions before we break out and get started?

176
00:23:14,889 --> 00:23:25,449
You want to set the record straight, that that was very funny, but they of also back to where it was, so.

177
00:23:25,449 --> 00:23:31,149
OK, OK, yeah. If you would, can you send me a link to that when you get a chance?

178
00:23:31,149 --> 00:23:37,469
No, no hurry. Awesome. Thank you so much. Any other questions.

179
00:23:37,469 --> 00:23:44,999
All right, so I'm going to mark the time I've got nine 11, so let's go until about nine thirty one or so.

180
00:23:44,999 --> 00:23:58,755
Go ahead and get settled into your groups and go ahead and work through things.

181
00:24:16,181 --> 00:24:23,141
All right, let's go ahead and reconvene and then just to mix up our order.

182
00:24:23,141 --> 00:24:28,481
Let's go ahead and start on this side of the room with group number three for

183
00:24:28,481 --> 00:24:34,861
the ever so hyped context of children and a school next to an oil refinery.

184
00:24:34,861 --> 00:24:43,231
Why did you come up with. Explosions of the fire or the.

185
00:24:43,231 --> 00:24:55,691
Chemical, physical. It's in the classroom.

186
00:24:55,691 --> 00:25:04,131
And then also. Chemical and. What chemicals are being used in the oil?

187
00:25:04,131 --> 00:25:12,281
The run off from that, how that's being stored and then also. Out of.

188
00:25:12,281 --> 00:25:22,361
How is that being? And then other ways to be taken care of because they're burning.

189
00:25:22,361 --> 00:25:29,901
Was been burning and burning things to make the actual oil.

190
00:25:29,901 --> 00:25:35,821
Some of the parties involved would be human error and atmosphere through the solar.

191
00:25:35,821 --> 00:25:41,921
Run off in the water. Toronto water.

192
00:25:41,921 --> 00:25:50,591
I mean, I was looking like. Involution. Particulate matter just.

193
00:25:50,591 --> 00:25:57,961
Like skin contact through playing outside or waiting outside.

194
00:25:57,961 --> 00:26:04,681
Suggestion they got into stuff, but also like the kids are planning something on the playground,

195
00:26:04,681 --> 00:26:12,401
they go inside and touch their face or something like that, washing your hands.

196
00:26:12,401 --> 00:26:21,391
But the most important one would probably be, look, this particular matter and I can go to the front of this, so we've got that sample.

197
00:26:21,391 --> 00:26:34,711
They need to be taken both inside of the classroom and outside. Measure like how much particulate matter and kids are actually taking in.

198
00:26:34,711 --> 00:26:48,681
And then also how that's being built to the. The air system that's coming into the school, looking at those filters that helped in the.

199
00:26:48,681 --> 00:26:58,161
So mostly the focus is on the kids. You're looking at both inside and outside of the school.

200
00:26:58,161 --> 00:27:06,021
And then we also the. Kind of like their exposure throughout the day and the.

201
00:27:06,021 --> 00:27:18,151
Oh, man, some people are trapped in. To and from like oil is being transported to and from the.

202
00:27:18,151 --> 00:27:26,131
Excellent. That's fantastic. Great job, group number three, so I'm going to try to summarize for the recording here,

203
00:27:26,131 --> 00:27:33,121
but you ended up highlighting smoke or particles related to the emissions.

204
00:27:33,121 --> 00:27:38,041
The exposure pathway would be the air, right.

205
00:27:38,041 --> 00:27:45,541
The the route of exposure of concern would be inhalation.

206
00:27:45,541 --> 00:27:50,131
You proposed some some measurements. Right.

207
00:27:50,131 --> 00:27:53,941
Which is great. I mean, the focus on the indoor right, for the most part,

208
00:27:53,941 --> 00:27:59,821
kids are spending most of their time at school indoors, even though they do spend some time outdoors.

209
00:27:59,821 --> 00:28:04,891
And super impressive. You went you went a step beyond and actually thought about some mitigation.

210
00:28:04,891 --> 00:28:10,441
Right. So when you're talking about, like the air handling system of the building and kind of monitoring it,

211
00:28:10,441 --> 00:28:14,791
it's how it's keeping up with with perhaps filtration. Right.

212
00:28:14,791 --> 00:28:22,901
Excellent job. Nice. Nice job. Any questions for number three from the rest of the.

213
00:28:22,901 --> 00:28:30,981
Or comments or additional ideas. All right, cool.

214
00:28:30,981 --> 00:28:44,241
Thanks again very much. Let's go ahead and move to group number two, where we're leaving the school and heading to a neighborhood adjacent to a farm.

215
00:28:44,241 --> 00:30:49,561
What did you all come up with? So.

216
00:30:49,561 --> 00:31:46,701
Tournaments. Kids minister.

217
00:31:46,701 --> 00:32:02,851
For example. This.

218
00:32:02,851 --> 00:32:54,111
David. Primarily.

219
00:32:54,111 --> 00:33:38,641
And Wallace for. Awesome.

220
00:33:38,641 --> 00:33:46,651
That's great. Thank you so much. Group number two. So starting with chemical hazard, right?

221
00:33:46,651 --> 00:33:58,021
Or at least from a source perspective, fertilizer application at a farm and then being concerned about runoff on that right.

222
00:33:58,021 --> 00:34:07,831
Grow. So runoff itself across the soil and into nearby water bodies as exposure pathways.

223
00:34:07,831 --> 00:34:16,771
And then with the primary concern for roots of exposure, I think this is where it kind of shifts a little bit.

224
00:34:16,771 --> 00:34:24,271
Right. It's a chemical source of contamination, but that once it ends up in the water,

225
00:34:24,271 --> 00:34:31,321
body can develop into or create basically biological hazards right up to the surface.

226
00:34:31,321 --> 00:34:43,201
So, you know, it's kids who ever live nearby that then are swimming or even playing, you know, in the vicinity of the water body coming into contact.

227
00:34:43,201 --> 00:34:46,391
Right. So so it's getting contact, perhaps even ingestion.

228
00:34:46,391 --> 00:34:52,141
And we're talking about kids, whether they're, you know, perhaps actually swimming and getting water in their mouth.

229
00:34:52,141 --> 00:34:57,211
But just from, you know, hand to hand to mouth activity.

230
00:34:57,211 --> 00:35:00,871
And then nice job on the seasonality component. Right.

231
00:35:00,871 --> 00:35:08,941
So recognizing that fertilizer application, you know, has it's not like year round going strong 12 months out of the year.

232
00:35:08,941 --> 00:35:14,221
It's, you know, during key times within farming cycles.

233
00:35:14,221 --> 00:35:24,391
And so getting maybe a baseline of what those measures look like prior to and then sampling throughput at perhaps the most intense time location.

234
00:35:24,391 --> 00:35:39,951
Any any questions or comments for a group to. Just edging out more.

235
00:35:39,951 --> 00:35:47,721
It would have given way to more than one third of their. To do that.

236
00:35:47,721 --> 00:35:55,941
And you could actually expand your your measurement campaign and in terms of measuring within those exposure pathways,

237
00:35:55,941 --> 00:36:02,871
you could collect runoff coming from distinct locations so that you're capturing runoff from individual farms.

238
00:36:02,871 --> 00:36:10,041
That's a concern. That would be one way to begin to identify which one is contributing.

239
00:36:10,041 --> 00:36:18,831
Yes, you you could I guess, if you knew perhaps what types of fertilizers each farm was applying,

240
00:36:18,831 --> 00:36:26,961
then simply by monitoring and doing some cool and a chemical analysis of your sample from just the water body itself,

241
00:36:26,961 --> 00:36:36,711
you might be able to identify some unique aspects of a fertilizer that's only coming from this farm is another great thought.

242
00:36:36,711 --> 00:36:48,311
I know there have been studies that say organic produce. I say ground up because it's very similar across fields around the land for.

243
00:36:48,311 --> 00:36:53,141
How long does not go by brains?

244
00:36:53,141 --> 00:37:01,291
Absolutely, and, you know, going from from fertilizer's to open up to pesticides like holy cow calibrator herbicides, whatever.

245
00:37:01,291 --> 00:37:07,331
Right. They may experience greatly in terms of what we're concerned about.

246
00:37:07,331 --> 00:37:13,131
Any other questions or comments? All right, thanks.

247
00:37:13,131 --> 00:37:20,631
And then last but not least, let's go ahead and move to group number one, who was focusing on flight attendants.

248
00:37:20,631 --> 00:38:08,451
So what did you all come up with? Yeah,

249
00:38:08,451 --> 00:38:16,621
the guys we voted for recognition as one of the reasons that it's so important

250
00:38:16,621 --> 00:38:23,301
for us to make some kind of has estimate based on how long they're in the air.

251
00:38:23,301 --> 00:38:28,331
I was just telling you, flying through the air crew and all that,

252
00:38:28,331 --> 00:38:36,941
we're going to be more accurate and we're trying to incorporate on air and just scary times with the security.

253
00:38:36,941 --> 00:38:47,231
But then also when they were on the plane wearing a badge or a senator or exactly what much does.

254
00:38:47,231 --> 00:38:57,611
And so you measure it. There is a reason why we're here, that you have some problems.

255
00:38:57,611 --> 00:39:04,181
And so you can be interested in, you know, the total number of days.

256
00:39:04,181 --> 00:39:12,851
And it really has to be said that it was really a huge amount of radiation like the government

257
00:39:12,851 --> 00:39:20,801
or somebody to certain because that the very fact that we deal with radiation and so on.

258
00:39:20,801 --> 00:39:27,851
But you also we're you a longitudinal study of and white.

259
00:39:27,851 --> 00:39:33,221
It's in the see, I still have and not have that kind of money.

260
00:39:33,221 --> 00:39:43,431
I don't see why. In part, that's because the money was see.

261
00:39:43,431 --> 00:39:49,161
Awesome. That's great. Thank you so much. So let's see a quick summary and I'll turn it back around.

262
00:39:49,161 --> 00:39:55,971
We're concerned about radiation, so from actually a combination of cosmic rays.

263
00:39:55,971 --> 00:40:00,171
But also you mentioned going through a security clearance, right?

264
00:40:00,171 --> 00:40:04,911
Frequently. So multiple sources potentially of radiation.

265
00:40:04,911 --> 00:40:16,091
So from that, a couple of different pathways as well for how that might reach a person you already classified as a physical hazard.

266
00:40:16,091 --> 00:40:21,271
In terms of measurements.

267
00:40:21,271 --> 00:40:32,341
You mentioned actually, you know, personal film badge dosimeters to measure actual radiation exposure.

268
00:40:32,341 --> 00:40:39,301
You have a couple of different options, right? Like kind of estimating maybe even more of like a survey or an activity log.

269
00:40:39,301 --> 00:40:45,381
Right. How many times you go through, how long you're on a flight, how many flights per week, things like this.

270
00:40:45,381 --> 00:40:48,291
But then you went, you want another step ahead?

271
00:40:48,291 --> 00:40:53,841
Again, kind of maybe coming back to a potential intervention is doing like this study right behind you,
