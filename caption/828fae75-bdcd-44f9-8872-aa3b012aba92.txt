1
00:00:04,610 --> 00:00:08,505
So today, I want to tell you
about the De-Jargonizer.

2
00:00:08,505 --> 00:00:11,440
Which is a really
interesting online tool

3
00:00:11,440 --> 00:00:12,985
that will help you to

4
00:00:12,985 --> 00:00:16,060
identify any jargon or

5
00:00:16,060 --> 00:00:19,975
uncommonly used words in
whatever it is you're writing.

6
00:00:19,975 --> 00:00:22,165
That can help you figure out

7
00:00:22,165 --> 00:00:24,640
what you might need
to change in order to

8
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:28,120
write in planer clear
language for audiences that

9
00:00:28,120 --> 00:00:30,520
may not know the
particular terminology

10
00:00:30,520 --> 00:00:32,365
that you are used to using.

11
00:00:32,365 --> 00:00:33,820
So it's really simple,

12
00:00:33,820 --> 00:00:36,900
all you do is load in a document,

13
00:00:36,900 --> 00:00:39,555
you can either choose the file
or add text manually,

14
00:00:39,555 --> 00:00:41,805
and it will highlight
word by word,

15
00:00:41,805 --> 00:00:42,880
the words that are less

16
00:00:42,880 --> 00:00:44,570
commonly used in
the English language.

17
00:00:44,570 --> 00:00:45,980
I've got a couple of examples

18
00:00:45,980 --> 00:00:47,645
I want us to go through today.

19
00:00:47,645 --> 00:00:49,250
So here's the first one.

20
00:00:49,250 --> 00:00:52,520
This is a paragraph from
the healthy people 2020 phase

21
00:00:52,520 --> 00:00:56,220
one report on
determinants of health.

22
00:00:56,220 --> 00:00:59,220
So we copy that,

23
00:00:59,220 --> 00:01:03,915
I'm just going do
this simple text copy here.

24
00:01:03,915 --> 00:01:06,465
Now, we push start,

25
00:01:06,465 --> 00:01:08,395
and lo and behold,

26
00:01:08,395 --> 00:01:11,915
it's identified certain
words that are really rare,

27
00:01:11,915 --> 00:01:13,370
and highlighted those in red,

28
00:01:13,370 --> 00:01:15,820
as well as mid-frequency words,

29
00:01:15,820 --> 00:01:19,410
less commonly used words,
highlighted in orange.

30
00:01:19,410 --> 00:01:21,170
Now, this is a little
small font here.

31
00:01:21,170 --> 00:01:23,330
So I've copied it out into

32
00:01:23,330 --> 00:01:26,935
my Word document to make
it easier for us to see.

33
00:01:26,935 --> 00:01:28,900
Here's the same text.

34
00:01:28,900 --> 00:01:31,555
Notice that words that
are highlighted in red,

35
00:01:31,555 --> 00:01:35,325
there things like determinants,
and susceptibility.

36
00:01:35,325 --> 00:01:37,660
Multi-syllabic words that are

37
00:01:37,660 --> 00:01:40,330
commonly used in
the public health field,

38
00:01:40,330 --> 00:01:42,520
to represent things like
determinants of health,

39
00:01:42,520 --> 00:01:44,665
things that cause health,

40
00:01:44,665 --> 00:01:47,440
or deficits in health as
well as susceptibility,

41
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:51,520
meaning risk or chance that
something might happen,

42
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:55,195
the potential for
a negative event to happen.

43
00:01:55,195 --> 00:01:58,735
It's also highlighted
words like objectives,

44
00:01:58,735 --> 00:02:01,360
which most people don't
talk about objectives.

45
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:02,600
They talk about what
they want, they

46
00:02:02,600 --> 00:02:03,910
talk about what needs to happen.

47
00:02:03,910 --> 00:02:05,425
They don't talk about objectives.

48
00:02:05,425 --> 00:02:07,765
So changing those kinds of words,

49
00:02:07,765 --> 00:02:09,550
will help the text

50
00:02:09,550 --> 00:02:12,350
be easier for most
people to understand.

51
00:02:12,350 --> 00:02:15,550
Let me give you another example.

52
00:02:15,550 --> 00:02:18,590
So this is a paragraph on

53
00:02:18,590 --> 00:02:22,190
survey data drawn from
a PhD dissertation.

54
00:02:22,190 --> 00:02:25,850
Now, you would expect
a PhD dissertation to be

55
00:02:25,850 --> 00:02:28,430
relatively difficult to read

56
00:02:28,430 --> 00:02:31,070
because it's using
academic terminology,

57
00:02:31,070 --> 00:02:33,455
it's written for other academics.

58
00:02:33,455 --> 00:02:35,600
But we can highlight what we

59
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:37,610
might want to change
if we wanted to

60
00:02:37,610 --> 00:02:40,610
talk about the survey data
and this research to

61
00:02:40,610 --> 00:02:42,650
a broader public
audience by taking

62
00:02:42,650 --> 00:02:45,650
the text from this and putting
it into the De-Jargonizer.

63
00:02:45,650 --> 00:02:47,380
So let me do that.

64
00:02:47,380 --> 00:02:52,490
Highlight this
paragraph, and copy it.

65
00:02:52,490 --> 00:02:56,030
I'll go back up here and put it

66
00:02:56,030 --> 00:02:59,600
into the De-Jargonizer,
and it start,

67
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:02,610
and notice it's
highlighted no red,

68
00:03:02,610 --> 00:03:05,190
but a lot of words
that are orange,

69
00:03:05,190 --> 00:03:07,110
suggesting that
they might be less

70
00:03:07,110 --> 00:03:09,725
common or more difficult
for people to understand.

71
00:03:09,725 --> 00:03:13,460
Now, again I've gone back
and copied that text

72
00:03:13,460 --> 00:03:17,825
already into my document
here, so as you can see it.

73
00:03:17,825 --> 00:03:20,225
Notice the words that have
been highlighted here.

74
00:03:20,225 --> 00:03:23,270
They're things like
initiation, continuation,

75
00:03:23,270 --> 00:03:26,880
and termination of programs,
prevalence estimates,

76
00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:29,795
incidence rates, as
well as things like

77
00:03:29,795 --> 00:03:33,980
evaluating the effects of
public health interventions.

78
00:03:33,980 --> 00:03:36,290
This is the terminology
we often use

79
00:03:36,290 --> 00:03:38,690
when we talk about
public health programs,

80
00:03:38,690 --> 00:03:40,820
or public health risks.

81
00:03:40,820 --> 00:03:44,210
But those terms most people
don't necessarily understand.

82
00:03:44,210 --> 00:03:46,430
If you want to write this type

83
00:03:46,430 --> 00:03:48,630
of content for
a broader audience,

84
00:03:48,630 --> 00:03:50,385
and make sure that people
will understand it,

85
00:03:50,385 --> 00:03:53,315
you can't just substitute
one word for another.

86
00:03:53,315 --> 00:03:55,880
You also have to change
the structure of what you're

87
00:03:55,880 --> 00:03:58,054
writing so that each sentence

88
00:03:58,054 --> 00:03:59,660
will be written in
plain language.

89
00:03:59,660 --> 00:04:02,150
Now, I've gone ahead
and done that.

90
00:04:02,150 --> 00:04:05,450
So instead of talking about
the rationale for initiation,

91
00:04:05,450 --> 00:04:08,435
and continuation, and
terminations of programs,

92
00:04:08,435 --> 00:04:11,870
I tried to revise in
using language that

93
00:04:11,870 --> 00:04:13,520
would be the way you might

94
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:15,470
talk to a person on the street.

95
00:04:15,470 --> 00:04:17,200
So notice what I've done here,

96
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:20,030
the first sentence is
health professionals often use

97
00:04:20,030 --> 00:04:21,680
people's answers to survey

98
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:24,300
questions to help them
decide whether to start,

99
00:04:24,300 --> 00:04:26,404
continue, or stop programs

100
00:04:26,404 --> 00:04:28,175
that try to make
people healthier.

101
00:04:28,175 --> 00:04:31,130
Notice, we don't have initiation,

102
00:04:31,130 --> 00:04:34,220
or termination, we
have start and stop,

103
00:04:34,220 --> 00:04:36,680
words that everybody understands.

104
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:38,655
Then later on, I say,

105
00:04:38,655 --> 00:04:41,270
health professionals
also use the answers to

106
00:04:41,270 --> 00:04:43,070
these questions to figure out

107
00:04:43,070 --> 00:04:45,265
whether health programs
are working.

108
00:04:45,265 --> 00:04:48,300
Notice, that's the idea
of evaluation,

109
00:04:48,300 --> 00:04:50,730
but I don't use
the word evaluation,

110
00:04:50,730 --> 00:04:55,370
I say, figure out whether
something is working or not.

111
00:04:55,370 --> 00:04:59,150
That changing of the phrasing
into plain language,

112
00:04:59,150 --> 00:05:00,230
means that people can get

113
00:05:00,230 --> 00:05:03,170
the idea without having
to know the jargon.

114
00:05:03,170 --> 00:05:04,670
That's often what we need

115
00:05:04,670 --> 00:05:05,990
to do when we want to talk about

116
00:05:05,990 --> 00:05:09,005
health topics to
a broader audience.

117
00:05:09,005 --> 00:05:13,175
So I wanted you to see
this De-Jargonizer tool.

118
00:05:13,175 --> 00:05:15,260
There are other tools out
there but I like this one,

119
00:05:15,260 --> 00:05:16,775
it is particularly useful,

120
00:05:16,775 --> 00:05:19,160
and I encourage you
whenever you have text

121
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:21,350
that you're trying to
bring to a broad audience,

122
00:05:21,350 --> 00:05:23,075
to make sure to check

123
00:05:23,075 --> 00:05:24,560
the language that
you're using and

124
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:26,180
the words that they're using,

125
00:05:26,180 --> 00:05:27,890
to make sure that
they aren't more

126
00:05:27,890 --> 00:05:30,133
difficult to understand
than they need to be.
