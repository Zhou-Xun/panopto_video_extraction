Perusall is a tool that allows you to collaborate with your peers on assigned readings and other documents.

2
00:00:08,810 --> 00:00:12,320
There are a couple of different ways to access the perusal readings,

3
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:20,800
you may see a Perusall menu in the left hand navigation of your Canvas course if this has been enabled by your instructor.

4
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:25,850
Or you'll access it from a specific Canvas assignment.

5
00:00:25,850 --> 00:00:34,220
If asked to provide a student ID, enter your University of Michigan unique name when opening Perusall. From an assignment,

6
00:00:34,220 --> 00:00:37,550
you'll be taken directly to the assigned file.

7
00:00:37,550 --> 00:00:47,380
If I had joined from the course navigation menu, I'll need to select a document or assignment from the left hand panel.

8
00:00:47,380 --> 00:00:54,430
In the upper left corner of the document, bubbles will show you whether anyone else is currently working in the document.

9
00:00:54,430 --> 00:01:01,380
As you scroll through, the highlights will show you where others have left comments.

10
00:01:01,380 --> 00:01:05,250
For your first read through, you may want to hide these highlights,

11
00:01:05,250 --> 00:01:16,040
which you can do from the comments filter in the top toolbar by choosing 'My comments'.

12
00:01:16,040 --> 00:01:21,760
Use the zoom options to adjust your view of the document.

13
00:01:21,760 --> 00:01:29,550
If allowed by your instructor, you can also download the document to read outside of perusal.

14
00:01:29,550 --> 00:01:35,610
When you're ready to comment, you'll use the annotate text and annotate figure tools.

15
00:01:35,610 --> 00:01:44,810
Annotate text allows you to highlight the text in a document to open the conversation panel on the right.

16
00:01:44,810 --> 00:01:54,400
Leave comments on images or items not able to be highlighted by making a selection using the annotate figure tool.

17
00:01:54,400 --> 00:02:01,000
View comments made by others by adjusting the comments filter to display all comments or any of the

18
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:08,020
other options provided this will show the highlights made by others that you can view one at a time,

19
00:02:08,020 --> 00:02:22,350
or from the all conversations panel. When viewing comments left by others, you can upvote.

20
00:02:22,350 --> 00:02:28,430
Reply. Tag others using the @ symbol.

21
00:02:28,430 --> 00:02:36,220
And favorite comments to save them to your starred comments.

22
00:02:36,220 --> 00:02:45,139
