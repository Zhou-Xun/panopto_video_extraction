1
00:00:00,570 --> 00:00:07,610
We don't know about you guys, but I think that's a positive message.

2
00:00:09,240 --> 00:00:18,910
Yeah, I think it's really great love.

3
00:00:19,050 --> 00:00:20,400
We really got to get started.

4
00:00:22,620 --> 00:00:37,260
So as I mentioned last class, I was going to be sharing her massive knowledge with you and you with her for most of the class.

5
00:00:37,650 --> 00:00:45,810
But before then, any announcements? No announcements.

6
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:54,180
All right. No organization or radical act planned to bring about social change over the weekend.

7
00:00:54,210 --> 00:00:57,240
You don't want to do that. So let's share something.

8
00:00:57,240 --> 00:01:06,750
I mean, social change could be like informing or educating someone, or maybe you yourself thinking about the world in a different way.

9
00:01:08,250 --> 00:01:17,990
I guess that I'm trying to let you know that big novel where it's not the new version that everybody's so cool.

10
00:01:18,660 --> 00:01:23,580
So the assignments that you turned in are in progress.

11
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:30,690
Right now, I feel any comments were in ones that I learned that look really good so far.

12
00:01:32,090 --> 00:01:37,350
I will have them graded this week. So somewhere, sometime soon you'll get a grade.

13
00:01:37,950 --> 00:01:47,280
Yeah. So when you when you look at them, you know, keep in mind that all the comments are not necessarily negative.

14
00:01:47,370 --> 00:01:54,120
So, again, this class is all about critical pedagogy. So some of the comments are about things to think about for the future.

15
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:58,050
So don't worry, because, you know, it's tough, right? Because you don't have context.

16
00:01:58,050 --> 00:02:05,070
So you could read it statement like, you know, what else happened.

17
00:02:06,420 --> 00:02:11,159
But it's really about that sassy. What else happened is more like what else happened?

18
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:17,130
Or What do you think about this or that? Yeah. So when you do that, when you see that, just keep that in mind.

19
00:02:17,190 --> 00:02:21,450
Yeah. We're getting nervous about somebody.

20
00:02:21,540 --> 00:02:24,990
Nervous? They look at the virus. I'm not worried about the environment.

21
00:02:25,740 --> 00:02:32,730
And then just a couple of things coming up. So this is our lovely syllabus for next week.

22
00:02:33,390 --> 00:02:39,840
We need to complete the culture identity inventory before you come to class and that should be on the canvas side.

23
00:02:40,110 --> 00:02:43,290
I think it's on the module for this class or the next class.

24
00:02:45,030 --> 00:02:50,009
What that is, is it is questionnaire just about your different identity.

25
00:02:50,010 --> 00:02:53,820
So I feel it's going to be talking today about intersectionality.

26
00:02:54,990 --> 00:03:00,540
We're going to be continuing to do kind of a deeper dove into intersectionality than we have before.

27
00:03:01,020 --> 00:03:09,210
And so this is this activity is really partially a reflective activity for you to be thinking about your different identities.

28
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:18,710
And then the CRC will be a discussion about both the process and the content.

29
00:03:18,810 --> 00:03:20,730
Again, we always focus on those two things.

30
00:03:21,930 --> 00:03:29,370
You don't have to share what you write on the document with anyone in your group and you don't have to share it with us.

31
00:03:29,820 --> 00:03:40,710
It's again something for you to be thinking about reflecting on, and then we'll have some specific questions that you'll address in the CRC.

32
00:03:41,260 --> 00:03:46,290
The other thing is your and the reflection journals are due next week.

33
00:03:46,860 --> 00:03:54,510
So we have in the syllabus 1011, but you can turn them in on the 13th, so the Thursday next week.

34
00:03:56,310 --> 00:04:00,900
So have you been kind of slacking a little bit on doing those?

35
00:04:01,260 --> 00:04:05,130
You've got a little over a week to kind of like kick it up a notch.

36
00:04:05,460 --> 00:04:10,800
And with that, what we're doing is we'll be looking at those and just making sure everyone's doing them correctly.

37
00:04:11,460 --> 00:04:18,450
So we're not really looking to write out kind of comments on it.

38
00:04:18,450 --> 00:04:22,290
It's really kind of a midway chat to make sure everything's all right.

39
00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:26,790
Any questions about either of those? Yeah, I can see the control.

40
00:04:27,930 --> 00:04:37,650
It's not on there. It's not that. I see. Okay. You know, I'm kind of screwed up, but so right after class, we'll make sure that it's on Thanksgiving.

41
00:04:40,590 --> 00:04:46,770
And with that, our our featured guest speaker for the day, it'd be nice.

42
00:04:46,770 --> 00:04:55,920
Everyone's like, All right, let's get started.

43
00:05:01,930 --> 00:05:05,470
All right. So we're talking about intersectionality today.

44
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:12,459
So I kind of wanted to start off because I know I was aware of this topic a little bit.

45
00:05:12,460 --> 00:05:19,150
You know, some of you talked about intersectionality a little bit in your assignment, so that was great to see that.

46
00:05:19,150 --> 00:05:24,940
So some of you want to share and kind of like start us off, let us know what is intersectionality.

47
00:05:28,420 --> 00:05:34,570
Yes, I would like different identities that somebody holds each other and I might give an example.

48
00:05:34,810 --> 00:05:43,640
So like, like I'm a woman, but I'm also mixed somehow for them have 14 and those are all three identities of those three together.

49
00:05:44,590 --> 00:05:56,049
Anyone want to add anything to that? You're going off this obvious point in terms of ideas about housing, oppression and so on,

50
00:05:56,050 --> 00:05:59,170
not just like stacked on top of each other, but kind of intertwined.

51
00:05:59,350 --> 00:06:03,610
Yeah, that's an important part, especially when we think about like public health, too.

52
00:06:03,640 --> 00:06:10,510
So thinking about how those different identities compound and kind of like you might have

53
00:06:10,510 --> 00:06:14,390
different impacts or different types of people based on your different intersectionality,

54
00:06:14,470 --> 00:06:19,550
I think are experiencing anything else. What I'm a little bit more about.

55
00:06:20,210 --> 00:06:21,920
It's application to public health as well.

56
00:06:24,230 --> 00:06:32,610
So this is I feel, you know, you know, you always have a great quote for us that there is no such thing as a single issue struggle.

57
00:06:33,130 --> 00:06:39,320
Not lives. Single issue lives. So I'm sure everybody in this room in a period that in some form or fashion.

58
00:06:39,320 --> 00:06:46,850
Right. So this is a cute cartoon that kind of talked a little bit more about intersectionality.

59
00:06:47,540 --> 00:06:53,800
This is just kind of like a little fun thing to get us started. So this is Bob Thornton.

60
00:06:54,230 --> 00:06:57,890
He is the stripey blue triangle and he's very proud of it.

61
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:05,000
And some people do not like him because he has a striking blue triangle.

62
00:07:05,480 --> 00:07:08,930
He faces oppression for being a triangle and for having stripes.

63
00:07:09,230 --> 00:07:17,540
So this is, like, super cute. And then there are liberation groups, but they're not intersectional.

64
00:07:17,540 --> 00:07:21,980
So you see it says, Welcome to the triangles and welcome the stripes there.

65
00:07:22,250 --> 00:07:27,530
They don't talk to each other and they actually compete. So I know people have like use terms like oppression,

66
00:07:27,530 --> 00:07:33,590
Olympics and things like that or like how different groups kind of like can be a little bit as far as like,

67
00:07:33,620 --> 00:07:38,480
you know, I'm more oppressed versus, you know, I'm more oppressed because X, Y and Z.

68
00:07:41,640 --> 00:07:48,090
And so Bob can't work out where to go. He can't figure out it's more of a strike where it's more of a triangle.

69
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:55,320
And so you can kind of see a little bit here, too, that the simple here is the oppression of one affects us all.

70
00:07:55,410 --> 00:07:58,770
I think that's such a great point, too, because, you know,

71
00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:07,020
especially when talking about intersectionality, you know, people like to, as we mention, like compete.

72
00:08:07,020 --> 00:08:13,770
People like to kind of like play the person who is more oppressed, who is not, who is more deserving of X, Y and Z and who is not.

73
00:08:14,580 --> 00:08:22,830
But really, it affects us all in different ways. So even if it doesn't directly impact you, you know, it can impact you in other ways as well.

74
00:08:26,200 --> 00:08:30,700
So intersectionality is the belief that oppression are interlinked and cannot be solved alone.

75
00:08:31,690 --> 00:08:38,130
They are not isolated intersectionality. So I just believe that when you talk about we want to keep this in the slides or not,

76
00:08:38,140 --> 00:08:41,730
but I just thought this is a really cute cartoon to get us started.

77
00:08:42,940 --> 00:08:51,550
So it is a framework for understanding. So people we do like use intersectionality as a term to describe people's experiences.

78
00:08:51,940 --> 00:08:56,499
But these the next few slides are really going to talk about the background of intersectionality,

79
00:08:56,500 --> 00:09:00,070
how it was created, and it really is a framework for understanding.

80
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:06,550
So we like to use frameworks and public health, right, to have some sort of like structure and definition of things.

81
00:09:07,270 --> 00:09:16,150
And it really talks about the multiple aspects of our identities and how they intersect, influence one another and compound different experiences.

82
00:09:16,270 --> 00:09:22,660
So it's often used to describe the ways and social privilege and oppression are complicated by the different parts of our lives,

83
00:09:23,590 --> 00:09:28,390
and so especially for marginalized and marginalized communities in different ways.

84
00:09:32,370 --> 00:09:43,770
So the origins of intersectionality. So we'll talk a little bit about Kimberlé Crenshaw, and she is the thought leader who coined the phrase.

85
00:09:44,070 --> 00:09:50,700
But the history does go back prior to her her paper deciding and really naming intersectionality.

86
00:09:50,780 --> 00:09:58,530
And so some scholars claim that Sojourner Truth interrogation or interrogation of intersections of race and gender.

87
00:09:58,860 --> 00:10:06,480
One of the earliest recorded accounts. So I don't know if people have learned about her speech in a woman.

88
00:10:06,780 --> 00:10:11,910
So this is a quote that existed in some transcriptions of it, but not others.

89
00:10:12,330 --> 00:10:20,310
So it's really a conflict. Or like if she really said this quote, but some people have a two of assuming that maybe she did.

90
00:10:21,240 --> 00:10:29,160
But it says, that man over there says that women need to be helped into carriages and leftover dishes and to have the best place everywhere.

91
00:10:29,640 --> 00:10:35,790
Nobody ever helps me insecurities or overfed puddles or give me any place in Iowa.

92
00:10:37,380 --> 00:10:44,550
And so her experiences as a black woman really shines through this quote a lot, especially thinking about this time frame as well.

93
00:10:44,580 --> 00:10:56,040
So this was transcribed. So this quote comes from the transcription by Mary, Mary Robinson, who was in the audience that day on April 21.

94
00:10:56,970 --> 00:11:04,350
But it does not include this part of the speech. But it appears of years later in everything from 18 great until the generation that the

95
00:11:04,350 --> 00:11:08,880
thing affects reality is also rooted in the writings of black and Chicano feminists,

96
00:11:09,750 --> 00:11:11,770
many of them lesbian identified.

97
00:11:11,820 --> 00:11:21,690
So especially if this is, you know, if you all are working on any papers specific to black and to kind of feminists or just women in general,

98
00:11:22,170 --> 00:11:29,040
this might be a great place to like really look at how different intersections of gender and race really impact those communities.

99
00:11:29,940 --> 00:11:35,970
And so it was really coined as an actual academic term in 1989 by Kimberly Crenshaw.

100
00:11:36,990 --> 00:11:41,220
And so people might also know her for critical race theory as well.

101
00:11:42,150 --> 00:11:45,959
And so you have a lawyer, and that is her background.

102
00:11:45,960 --> 00:11:54,060
She writes a lot of know, I guess like briefs or papers, I would call them.

103
00:11:54,140 --> 00:12:01,440
But, you know, taking a critical look at the legal issues and issues of the court.

104
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:09,540
So it's really unique. One of the links actually on the campus page is not a required reading, but I do encourage you all to take a look at it.

105
00:12:10,110 --> 00:12:17,009
I read it was a pretty long article on Vox and they did like a full piece on Kimberly

106
00:12:17,010 --> 00:12:23,790
Crenshaw and really kind of unpacked all of her work since she began in academia.

107
00:12:23,790 --> 00:12:30,359
And it's a really unique article I think, and it really kind of like frames her work and she really talks about the beginnings

108
00:12:30,360 --> 00:12:35,790
of intersectionality and so she talks about the actual paper itself from 1989,

109
00:12:36,150 --> 00:12:44,760
really focused on three legal cases. One of the legal cases that stood out to me was a case against General Motors.

110
00:12:44,790 --> 00:12:53,540
Here was I think that's why stood out to me where there were a group of black women in the seventies who so

111
00:12:53,610 --> 00:13:00,689
basically in the seventies there was a recession and they didn't like a group of like just sweeping firings.

112
00:13:00,690 --> 00:13:03,690
So like, you know, layoffs and stuff like that across the company.

113
00:13:03,990 --> 00:13:10,830
And all the black women were terminated because prior to 1964, there were no black women that were employed by General Motors.

114
00:13:11,610 --> 00:13:14,189
And so they based their layoffs on seniority.

115
00:13:14,190 --> 00:13:21,929
So because they weren't employed before 1964, when the layoff happened, they all got fired because of that policy.

116
00:13:21,930 --> 00:13:29,760
And so when this was brought up and court that that these women in particular faced a different type of discrimination.

117
00:13:29,970 --> 00:13:33,600
And it wasn't because of solely their race and it wasn't because of solely gender,

118
00:13:33,930 --> 00:13:36,630
then their experience was different because of both of those things.

119
00:13:37,740 --> 00:13:42,810
The judge actually decided that, you know, those two things being together didn't matter.

120
00:13:43,140 --> 00:13:48,060
They had to file based on either race or based on gender, when in reality it was based on both.

121
00:13:48,420 --> 00:13:51,900
So that was one of the cases that stood out to me.

122
00:13:51,910 --> 00:14:01,530
And so she, you know, critiqued this decision by the judge and she talks about, you know, in detail about why that decision,

123
00:14:01,530 --> 00:14:06,870
you know, isn't necessarily reflective of the experiences of those women from that lawsuit.

124
00:14:08,820 --> 00:14:15,600
So getting back to the side of political and social categories are understood with attention to the ways in which we

125
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:24,720
embody multiple identities or social statutes as statuses with a special focus on multiply marginalized statuses.

126
00:14:25,770 --> 00:14:30,870
And so membership in these different groups possess varying levels of social power and privilege.

127
00:14:31,460 --> 00:14:35,480
And they may compound. So let's talk a little bit more about that, because you mentioned that earlier.

128
00:14:36,440 --> 00:14:40,640
What ways can you think of that might impact like public health?

129
00:14:40,650 --> 00:14:49,460
So how do different identities compound to one another and kind of create specific experiences for individuals?

130
00:14:50,090 --> 00:14:58,670
Like what? Like health outcomes? Can you think that's reflective of that in your classes or different maybe in your work?

131
00:15:00,680 --> 00:15:13,489
Can you think of any? Well, you can think of some, because I thought in your papers I thought of one I did a couple years ago so I can speak up.

132
00:15:13,490 --> 00:15:25,040
But I looked like the under diagnosis of autism in black and Latin X children and how they're diagnoses for anyone 18 and under.

133
00:15:25,430 --> 00:15:33,370
And several years later that when white parents brought up their concerns with their child, maybe developmental delay.

134
00:15:35,220 --> 00:15:42,200
So yeah. And I also looked at the fact that was happening to mainly like kids who are girls.

135
00:15:42,410 --> 00:15:48,950
So like essentially the intersection of like race and gender as well.

136
00:15:49,130 --> 00:15:55,030
Cool. That's really neat. Anybody else? What about from the assignments?

137
00:15:55,330 --> 00:16:08,120
Any examples from the assignments? I'm sorry, but look at what I wrote the program intervention for.

138
00:16:10,530 --> 00:16:22,040
Okay. Application. And a lot of the fears that that this population face especially was like language barriers for socioeconomic barriers.

139
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:29,510
Ultimately, some of those there may not have been undocumented or may have had struggles with citizenship status.

140
00:16:30,590 --> 00:16:38,630
And then something I put in my paper specifically, I like critiqued their take on intersectionality because there's a lot beyond that.

141
00:16:38,730 --> 00:16:43,510
Like that wasn't really covered in there. Yeah.

142
00:16:44,090 --> 00:16:53,149
What like, what else do you think could have been covered? I think disability is also a really big thing that a lot of people sadly don't factor in,

143
00:16:53,150 --> 00:17:00,350
especially like sex education and also of cervical cancer and other like cancer prevention.

144
00:17:01,850 --> 00:17:04,489
A lot of accessibility needs not just for like physical disabilities,

145
00:17:04,490 --> 00:17:10,550
but also invisible realities that need to be considered in these types of education.

146
00:17:10,700 --> 00:17:15,350
Right. Yeah, that that's a great example. So like looking at she was talking about that.

147
00:17:15,830 --> 00:17:24,740
I don't know if anybody else. I know people that wrote about the cervical cancer program for the assignment that was focused on Latino immigrants.

148
00:17:25,130 --> 00:17:31,250
And so it was really interesting because you bring up a good point that not only race and gender were factors in this program.

149
00:17:31,250 --> 00:17:38,329
Right. Because it was it was for women. And secondly, also, you know, immigration status.

150
00:17:38,330 --> 00:17:42,770
So are they documented, undocumented? When did they immigrate?

151
00:17:42,770 --> 00:17:46,759
You know, have they been here for some time? And they just recently immigrated.

152
00:17:46,760 --> 00:17:52,129
And so it's really important to consider all of those different factors as well, because not only, you know,

153
00:17:52,130 --> 00:17:59,670
especially you think about like immigrant status, you know, that's that's not that separate from race, but it is related.

154
00:17:59,720 --> 00:18:05,690
Right. So it's like we just assumed that Latino women have the same experiences.

155
00:18:05,690 --> 00:18:12,020
You know, we're really missing out on being able to provide all of the participants the programing that they need.

156
00:18:12,650 --> 00:18:21,020
Anything else? Any other thoughts? Yeah, that is kind of a weird example.

157
00:18:21,020 --> 00:18:31,010
But there is a show I watched called Under the Banner of Heaven and it goes under the Banner of Heaven starring Andrew Garfield.

158
00:18:31,370 --> 00:18:39,710
And he like he plays a cop, he plays a mormon cop, and he like, it's like a mini series, but like over the course of the series, like,

159
00:18:39,980 --> 00:18:45,080
he's trying to solve a murder that happened in the Mormon community and like, wow,

160
00:18:45,080 --> 00:18:49,399
he's like discovering all these things, like all these clues leading up to the murder.

161
00:18:49,400 --> 00:18:58,100
Like he's also dealing with like his mother, who's, like, really sick and like, I think has schizophrenia, I believe that aren't exactly remember.

162
00:18:58,100 --> 00:19:05,060
But he like he also starts to struggle with like his Mormon identity because he learned so much about Mormon history.

163
00:19:05,420 --> 00:19:10,990
And at the same time, like he's like his mother is like, [INAUDIBLE].

164
00:19:11,390 --> 00:19:20,510
He doesn't want his mother to take like antipsychotics because of his Mormon religion and how, like, they don't believe in,

165
00:19:21,020 --> 00:19:26,540
you know, taking medicine like that because they think like it's a gift from God, like what they have.

166
00:19:26,990 --> 00:19:34,129
So, like, I guess what I was thinking about was like how like the intersection between intersectionality, between like medicine and religion,

167
00:19:34,130 --> 00:19:41,930
and like how a lot of people struggle with what they can take care of and what they leave up to God in a sense.

168
00:19:42,590 --> 00:19:48,049
Yeah, that's a good point too, because especially we're thinking about like power and privilege.

169
00:19:48,050 --> 00:19:56,390
I think that religion is something that like we tend to like focus on race and gender, like the things that we kind of like talk more about.

170
00:19:56,780 --> 00:20:01,729
But considering religion is an important thing as well, especially when thinking about like privilege, right?

171
00:20:01,730 --> 00:20:05,450
In this country, specifically anyone else.

172
00:20:08,930 --> 00:20:18,530
Okay. All right. So the final point experiences of power and privilege based on one social identity group may vary according to context,

173
00:20:19,370 --> 00:20:22,710
as well as the composition and visibility of their person. That was that is.

174
00:20:22,730 --> 00:20:30,200
So you raise a good point about disability status as well being whether it's invisible or visible.

175
00:20:32,540 --> 00:20:37,110
All right. So how can intersectionality increase inclusivity?

176
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:46,620
So first, it can help to ensure that certain groups of people are not left out of critical discourse due to their varied social identities.

177
00:20:47,460 --> 00:20:48,780
So let's talk a little bit about that.

178
00:20:50,100 --> 00:20:57,780
In what ways do we discuss intersectionality and in making sure that certain groups are left out and we leave a group?

179
00:21:01,100 --> 00:21:09,079
One thing that comes to mind is like like voting and how like there's been a big push to get people registered to vote,

180
00:21:09,080 --> 00:21:18,270
especially who might not have access typically and like about like disability issues of like is voting accessible or like people who may be like,

181
00:21:18,290 --> 00:21:21,220
yeah, or residents but aren't citizens like. Right. I don't know.

182
00:21:21,230 --> 00:21:25,940
Just making people's voices heard in like, even like very formal political processes,

183
00:21:27,080 --> 00:21:31,820
like accounting for like their various social identities, like the barriers that might exist because of that.

184
00:21:31,990 --> 00:21:36,620
Right. Yeah, that's a huge topic. And especially it was huge like when covered for slavery.

185
00:21:36,620 --> 00:21:40,280
So. Yeah. So anybody else, you know, thoughts?

186
00:21:40,670 --> 00:21:49,040
Yeah. I feel like when you have conversations about intersectionality and you do like that to me where you ask someone to name their identities,

187
00:21:49,850 --> 00:21:59,330
a lot of times people become aware of identity, so they didn't realize, like being able bodied, having a driver's license and stuff like that.

188
00:22:00,020 --> 00:22:05,870
So when you have these conversations, you will be trying to get to consciousness.

189
00:22:06,100 --> 00:22:11,899
Yeah, that's a really key point. And then you realize how many, even if you're reflecting on your own identity,

190
00:22:11,900 --> 00:22:16,050
do you realize like how many groups get left out of the conversation with that?

191
00:22:16,070 --> 00:22:23,830
So that's a great point. Anyone else? Great.

192
00:22:24,320 --> 00:22:31,610
So it does allow also people to understand one another in a more broad spectrum instead of just by one social identity.

193
00:22:31,610 --> 00:22:38,120
So kind of touching on that as well. And then also helping people to find common ground with others and better relate to people around them.

194
00:22:38,120 --> 00:22:41,689
So why why are these points important for public health?

195
00:22:41,690 --> 00:22:48,080
Like, why is this relevant to our work? Yeah.

196
00:22:49,280 --> 00:22:53,330
Just like one idea. Like you're working with communities, like.

197
00:22:54,360 --> 00:22:58,319
I feel like, how could you even do that work without thinking about these points?

198
00:22:58,320 --> 00:23:06,209
Or just like at least trying to, like, understand, like linebackers stand one another instead of like one.

199
00:23:06,210 --> 00:23:13,290
So like, I think you're going to be doing interventions and maybe like the intervention is like race or ethnicity based,

200
00:23:14,370 --> 00:23:20,429
but you have participants like from different genders. You can't just ignore that they might have different experiences.

201
00:23:20,430 --> 00:23:24,300
So I think it's really important like going into those places to keep that in mind.

202
00:23:24,420 --> 00:23:28,020
Yeah, definitely great points for sure. Anyone else?

203
00:23:29,460 --> 00:23:37,770
Yeah. So the whole idea behind public health is promoting like health equity in terms of like the entire.

204
00:23:38,800 --> 00:23:42,930
Yeah. Just focusing on specific demographic or social group.

205
00:23:43,710 --> 00:23:46,530
A lot of times there's like a lot of overlap.

206
00:23:47,370 --> 00:23:56,069
And if you don't take an intersectional intersectionality into when addressing these social and like health inequities,

207
00:23:56,070 --> 00:24:00,580
you aren't going to be able to address these disparities that there seems to be two different demographics.

208
00:24:02,190 --> 00:24:09,269
Yeah, definitely. And like especially when we talk about looking at and I know people talked about this in their assignment to like looking

209
00:24:09,270 --> 00:24:17,610
at how we address different issues like based on like different areas of influence within this Anthological model.

210
00:24:17,940 --> 00:24:21,870
You know, it's really important to think about how we're also intervening in those areas as well,

211
00:24:22,200 --> 00:24:26,160
keeping that into account while also thinking about the different ways that people

212
00:24:26,700 --> 00:24:33,060
interact with one another and then how identity impacts their lives so nobody else.

213
00:24:34,780 --> 00:24:40,230
And so so getting to that a little bit more.

214
00:24:40,710 --> 00:24:48,990
So social engineers are not independent and they're not two dimensional, but they're multiple and intersecting and people from multiple,

215
00:24:48,990 --> 00:24:55,530
historically oppressed and marginalized groups or a starting point and so multiple

216
00:24:55,530 --> 00:24:59,520
social identity that the micro-level intersect with macro level structural factors.

217
00:25:00,120 --> 00:25:06,569
So let's talk about that a little bit as well, because I think this is a really key point that that is really important to public health,

218
00:25:06,570 --> 00:25:13,740
that we talk we talk about structural issues and structural factors, but I think sometimes that gets left out of the conversation.

219
00:25:13,740 --> 00:25:25,020
So like let's talk about the third point. And so how do our identities at our individual identities really intersect with the world around us?

220
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:29,360
Like, how does that come to me as one person or as one person?

221
00:25:29,370 --> 00:25:36,419
How does that impact structural factors? I'm thinking about two things for that question.

222
00:25:36,420 --> 00:25:43,829
One is about how race isn't like determining factors like getting COVID or dying from COVID,

223
00:25:43,830 --> 00:25:50,370
but it's about racism and how like the work by our lean departments and like how

224
00:25:50,370 --> 00:25:55,420
black women have higher esthetic loads and like are aging faster than white women.

225
00:25:55,470 --> 00:26:00,980
But that's not because they're black, but because of the compounded racism and sexism that they experience.

226
00:26:00,990 --> 00:26:09,080
Yeah, definitely. I'm actually taking Darlene's class this semester, so I just read that paper, so it's actually hilarious.

227
00:26:09,090 --> 00:26:18,450
But but yeah, those are great points. And like especially when thinking about COVID, I think of that is probably one of the examples that most people,

228
00:26:18,780 --> 00:26:21,510
you know, maybe read about or heard about in the news and how,

229
00:26:21,810 --> 00:26:28,320
you know, black people in different communities were more likely to get COVID and die from COVID because they're more susceptible.

230
00:26:29,160 --> 00:26:33,780
But there are for a lot of different structural factors and different reasons as to why that was the case.

231
00:26:33,780 --> 00:26:37,769
And so mostly racism, but also other issues as well.

232
00:26:37,770 --> 00:26:41,490
And so it's important that we recognize that because, you know,

233
00:26:41,550 --> 00:26:48,900
one person's different intersecting identities is not the only reason why certain health outcomes are more or less likely for them.

234
00:26:48,900 --> 00:26:52,470
Right. There are outside factors that also impact that as well.

235
00:26:52,560 --> 00:26:56,670
So anybody else, any other examples I could think of?

236
00:27:08,570 --> 00:27:15,080
So the last few lines were actually on the screen or any kind of movie that doesn't get any kind of.

237
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:20,000
But in anger.

238
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:27,610
I feel free to chime in on this one, too. But this was an activity which what's interesting with this review since then,

239
00:27:27,980 --> 00:27:40,330
like several activities for young people living with HIV and also around interventions to prevent HIV for mostly LGBT folks of color.

240
00:27:40,610 --> 00:27:45,320
So I didn't know if it was just for one intervention. The answer is a lot.

241
00:27:45,500 --> 00:27:52,219
Yeah. And feel like this activity is really focused on really helping individuals and participants

242
00:27:52,220 --> 00:27:57,710
in various programs understand their various identities and how they intersect,

243
00:27:58,490 --> 00:28:04,160
but then also physically represent them. So like stay with color and we'll show a few examples next,

244
00:28:04,160 --> 00:28:11,660
but physically represent them on the page and by coloring and kind of which colors represent different parts of their identities.

245
00:28:12,500 --> 00:28:17,930
And then kind of like thinking about how that impacts their lives, especially depending on their different environments.

246
00:28:18,080 --> 00:28:26,870
And so there are a few examples. And so you kind of see how just visually it's so different for everyone, right?

247
00:28:27,830 --> 00:28:35,600
Everyone is different. Everyone has their own unique way of one expressing their different identity and into what their identities are.

248
00:28:36,380 --> 00:28:40,760
Any other observations about about these without any context?

249
00:28:42,740 --> 00:28:46,490
To add one thing before trying to be silent, which is really hard.

250
00:28:48,050 --> 00:28:57,740
So with this one thing that the participants could do is to create the drawings differently for different contexts.

251
00:28:58,130 --> 00:29:02,570
So like, for instance, the top three, those are all the same person.

252
00:29:03,470 --> 00:29:12,290
And his salient identities were being Mexican-American, being gay and being a man are his masculinity.

253
00:29:12,590 --> 00:29:16,040
And so the far right is when he's with his family.

254
00:29:16,490 --> 00:29:25,510
So he's always with his family. He's all Mexican. The center is when he is with his friends and most of his friends are gay.

255
00:29:25,520 --> 00:29:35,800
So he's all gay. And then the other one is when he's in school and he talked about how people see him on the outside as Mexican-Americans.

256
00:29:35,810 --> 00:29:43,130
So that's the red. But they also see him as a as a man, his body, because of the way he presents.

257
00:29:43,520 --> 00:29:51,500
But then the blue was that he said he's gay at heart and real and with the red one, too.

258
00:29:52,700 --> 00:29:53,870
You put out, you can't see on here,

259
00:29:53,870 --> 00:30:04,550
but you put a blue dot in the corner and said that his sexuality can't be anywhere near his cells when he's with his families.

260
00:30:05,510 --> 00:30:09,559
And so it's it's an interesting activity, especially for younger folks,

261
00:30:09,560 --> 00:30:14,210
because if you're working with adolescents or even I've done a similar thing with children.

262
00:30:14,840 --> 00:30:20,299
So to talk about intersex identities is such an abstract concept, you know,

263
00:30:20,300 --> 00:30:24,680
so if you ask people to dissect their identities, I don't know what the [INAUDIBLE] that means.

264
00:30:25,010 --> 00:30:28,190
And so this actually evolved from work.

265
00:30:28,190 --> 00:30:30,890
I did used to do with kids living with cancer,

266
00:30:31,300 --> 00:30:38,000
where we would talk about emotions and they would create different colored for different emotions and then fill in this.

267
00:30:38,320 --> 00:30:42,410
It was called a mandela circle. And so this emerged from that.

268
00:30:42,410 --> 00:30:48,080
And a lot of the folks that we use it with really enjoy it because it's not just like talking,

269
00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:52,820
it's actually drawing and then sharing and and digging deeper.

270
00:30:52,820 --> 00:30:59,870
And, you know, some people are really shocked, you know, when they saw what other people could,

271
00:30:59,870 --> 00:31:03,050
but then also themselves, because they never really thought about that before.

272
00:31:05,120 --> 00:31:09,139
And then also considering, too and you touched on this as well,

273
00:31:09,140 --> 00:31:15,980
but considering not only your own identity and what you think about yourself, but also how others do you in a different context.

274
00:31:15,990 --> 00:31:22,550
So it's really important. So I think that this is beautiful, surprisingly, not a lot of fun.

275
00:31:22,560 --> 00:31:27,110
Yeah. So that is really all we have for intersectionality.

276
00:31:27,110 --> 00:31:30,890
I mean, honestly, like I said in some of your assignments,

277
00:31:31,160 --> 00:31:37,940
different people to about intersectionality is why that's an important concept to apply, especially when you're thinking about interventions.

278
00:31:37,940 --> 00:31:43,160
And so you all are really on the right track and you really kind of understand this topic we never talked about.

279
00:31:43,170 --> 00:31:46,250
I don't I don't think I knew what intersectionality was until like.

280
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:54,120
My Master's program maybe, or like shortly before, which was several years ago.

281
00:31:56,400 --> 00:31:59,790
But, you know, we never talked about this in undergrad at all.

282
00:31:59,910 --> 00:32:06,239
So, you know, it's really great to kind of, you know, here you are talking about it in such a different way.

283
00:32:06,240 --> 00:32:09,690
But I didn't have that experience. So yeah.

284
00:32:09,960 --> 00:32:13,920
Any other final comments? Why the sexuality?

285
00:32:16,230 --> 00:32:26,700
Lauren Just to be frank and relax, give me this microphone away from me.

286
00:32:27,030 --> 00:32:36,060
Thank you. Yeah, I think one thing that's important, too, when you when you look at Kimberly Crenshaw's work again,

287
00:32:36,240 --> 00:32:39,900
like Akeelah said, other people have talked about this concept conceptually.

288
00:32:40,140 --> 00:32:43,620
So it's really not a new concept so much.

289
00:32:43,620 --> 00:32:52,019
I mean, even W.E.B. Dubois talked about it at some level where he talked about the wage of being black for workers,

290
00:32:52,020 --> 00:32:54,530
and he was talking about black men versus white men.

291
00:32:54,540 --> 00:33:00,830
So, you know, it's a concept that's been around for a while, but it's really interesting that came out of this,

292
00:33:01,020 --> 00:33:06,150
you know, and it was really about her interrogation of all these legal cases.

293
00:33:07,020 --> 00:33:16,050
And I think what that really speaks to is the need for interdisciplinarity and even what some people call transdisciplinary approaches,

294
00:33:16,380 --> 00:33:21,330
where you take approaches from different disciplines and meld them together versus just saying,

295
00:33:21,330 --> 00:33:25,110
okay, this is law, this is public health, this is medicine.

296
00:33:26,130 --> 00:33:32,640
And it really is a very if you read her, you know, some of her initial work,

297
00:33:32,880 --> 00:33:38,220
it's kind of like, oh, my God, this is like horrific that this was going on, you know?

298
00:33:38,220 --> 00:33:44,130
And I think for a lot of folks, because, again, a lot of the cases were very much earlier,

299
00:33:45,390 --> 00:33:49,980
you know, when you look at those are like, I can't believe that that actually happened.

300
00:33:50,400 --> 00:33:55,440
But we also had the civil rights movement and we saw all the horrific things that were happening prior to that.

301
00:33:55,480 --> 00:33:58,050
Well, the perfect thing doesn't happen the day before.

302
00:33:58,230 --> 00:34:05,700
So I think it's you know, it's important for us to get outside of just public health and read about these different areas and really learn from them.

303
00:34:06,570 --> 00:34:12,000
And it is really interesting because I think in public health more and more now, intersectionality has become a little more mainstream.

304
00:34:12,930 --> 00:34:18,780
But if you think about it, it came out of legal studies. So we don't typically think about, you know, that intersection.

305
00:34:19,220 --> 00:34:28,890
Right. Yeah. And if you really want an easier break down because I started reading the paper and I was like know, very academic, very good.

306
00:34:29,340 --> 00:34:33,530
The article does a great job of breaking it down. Well, yeah.

307
00:34:34,440 --> 00:34:41,549
Because Yeah. Because law review articles are yeah I just that's one many, many moons ago.

308
00:34:41,550 --> 00:34:48,270
And then I was like, oh, I put one on for critical.

309
00:34:48,750 --> 00:34:52,620
I can't really stay with it for actually today it's kind of it's right there

310
00:34:52,620 --> 00:34:59,219
critical and a little I don't know if I shared this little story or not because,

311
00:34:59,220 --> 00:35:04,049
you know, I just know a lot of stories. But when I was on sabbatical years ago,

312
00:35:04,050 --> 00:35:15,240
I was part of the UCLA law school and Kimberlé Crenshaw was the office was down the hall from my office, and I felt like a preparer.

313
00:35:15,240 --> 00:35:20,940
I would always kind of like, you know, go to the bathroom a lot. So I did see it really.

314
00:35:20,940 --> 00:35:25,139
Crenshaw was there and then I found she was gone all the time.

315
00:35:25,140 --> 00:35:34,980
I was, yeah, it was a little crazy because I remember walking down the hall and seeing her name on the door and I was like, passed out in the hallway.

316
00:35:36,540 --> 00:35:42,119
It's like, Is this the garbage? And I was like, Yeah, it was pretty scary.

317
00:35:42,120 --> 00:35:46,259
I mean, like, you know, academics were kind of nerdy and different ways.

318
00:35:46,260 --> 00:35:49,229
And I, like other people, are like looking for the Kardashians.

319
00:35:49,230 --> 00:36:00,450
And, you know, I'm looking for Kimberly Crenshaw and then Lisa Boling, who we cited some of her work.

320
00:36:00,450 --> 00:36:09,630
And you read how many people have read Lisa bowling's work in other classes, you know, and you should read all of her work.

321
00:36:10,830 --> 00:36:17,460
Now, Lisa's just a really powerful, amazing human.

322
00:36:18,960 --> 00:36:22,440
And she now has an intersectionality institute.

323
00:36:23,040 --> 00:36:26,400
So she's at George Washington University.

324
00:36:27,360 --> 00:36:33,660
And this past summer, she had her first kind of summer intersectionality retreat,

325
00:36:34,260 --> 00:36:41,860
where she had I think there are about 40 people all the way from grad students to new professors,

326
00:36:41,880 --> 00:36:45,990
all professors to really interrogate and talk about it.

327
00:36:46,170 --> 00:36:53,850
And I just saw she just sent me a. The other day that now they're doing these like one day institutes for academics.

328
00:36:53,850 --> 00:37:00,990
But I keep telling her we need something for undergrads, not just, you know, all those.

329
00:37:01,470 --> 00:37:06,209
So who knows? And Lisa, she used to give a lot of talk.

330
00:37:06,210 --> 00:37:10,620
So she's since I've been here with her in ten years, she's probably talked here like three or four times.

331
00:37:11,040 --> 00:37:15,390
She's done a lot of work or she used to do work with people in the Institute for Social Research.

332
00:37:16,230 --> 00:37:20,160
So I know they brought her in and just had her work.

333
00:37:20,160 --> 00:37:28,260
I mean, she's one of the kind of wrote that kind of she wrote the one of the first articles

334
00:37:28,260 --> 00:37:32,130
that talked about how we need to be putting intersectionality into public health.

335
00:37:33,150 --> 00:37:44,190
And she has a lot of other pieces that are really powerful pieces talking about that, that a really good article that came out in the past two years,

336
00:37:45,240 --> 00:37:54,330
kind of reflecting on her 23 years as a black woman doing this type of work and

337
00:37:54,330 --> 00:37:59,250
working primarily within white institutions and male dominated institutions.

338
00:37:59,250 --> 00:38:06,060
So it's a really powerful institution. So I would encourage folks to to read more of her work.

339
00:38:06,870 --> 00:38:13,500
All right. So we're going to continue to think critically because good old Albert Einstein,

340
00:38:14,730 --> 00:38:19,530
we cannot solve problems with the same thinking we used used when we created them.

341
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:26,100
And yeah, I think the world because we've created a lot of problems.

342
00:38:27,120 --> 00:38:36,270
And so I think we need a lot of new approaches. How many people talk about critical theory in other classes, like WGA classes or, you know, others?

343
00:38:36,340 --> 00:38:42,730
Okay. And now I know people are afraid to raise a hand because another question is for you, just whatever that means.

344
00:38:43,710 --> 00:38:48,210
I think that is a guy who can remember what you talked about.

345
00:38:49,710 --> 00:38:52,950
Does anyone remember anything that you talked about?

346
00:38:57,440 --> 00:39:02,040
I love the way people's eyes go the other way. Right now your eyes are going, like, over their head.

347
00:39:02,660 --> 00:39:06,600
You all look at me. That's okay.

348
00:39:06,610 --> 00:39:10,550
Again, I'm a psychologist that I really don't get. I'm always interpreting human behavior.

349
00:39:12,200 --> 00:39:21,470
Think of the word. What do you think critical theory is? You don't think critically as.

350
00:39:21,810 --> 00:39:28,240
I have said. What do you think critical theory is? You know, theories are critical.

351
00:39:28,270 --> 00:39:34,149
It's. He's been there.

352
00:39:34,150 --> 00:39:46,030
All that? Yes. Is it like a wrong note or is it like rebel consciousness where you have to think of something really reflectively?

353
00:39:46,390 --> 00:39:54,250
Okay. That's part of it. So I think, you know, I think it's critically the process of reflection, which is is really critical to anything.

354
00:39:54,250 --> 00:39:58,719
Critical. Critically reading so few.

355
00:39:58,720 --> 00:40:03,250
Too many. What else? What do you think might be other aspects of critical theory?

356
00:40:07,690 --> 00:40:13,659
Camille. Oh, it's you. Henry took your hand, was behind Hanna's head, but your eyes were in danger.

357
00:40:13,660 --> 00:40:17,080
I was going to volunteer right now. I didn't have my hand.

358
00:40:17,680 --> 00:40:18,340
I couldn't see.

359
00:40:20,230 --> 00:40:30,969
Okay, I'm thinking maybe I do like analyzing existing theories in terms of, like, the structures that exist and like, that created those theories.

360
00:40:30,970 --> 00:40:31,180
You're like,

361
00:40:31,420 --> 00:40:40,120
led people to create chaos theory or just like creating your own theories in terms of like structures and not just individual like you're saying,

362
00:40:40,120 --> 00:40:44,200
this person or whatever kind of like group of people interact with society.

363
00:40:45,520 --> 00:40:50,290
Yeah, that's the other aspects. And if you think about like ten these work, we talk about how to be an anti-racist.

364
00:40:50,860 --> 00:40:53,860
You know, he does a lot of like, you know, critiquing,

365
00:40:53,860 --> 00:41:01,630
interrogating the structures and systems that created empowered prior to or talking about creating systems and structures that perpetuate oppression.

366
00:41:02,320 --> 00:41:08,320
Good. What are some other aspects? Do you think of it as really sad?

367
00:41:09,850 --> 00:41:14,530
Yeah. Sorry, I'm an antagonist, but I think it predictable.

368
00:41:14,530 --> 00:41:22,390
There's rising tension has to do with, um, like assumptions, like how we can, like,

369
00:41:23,050 --> 00:41:28,810
study or like investigate, like the assumptions we have of the world, like people around us.

370
00:41:28,810 --> 00:41:32,980
And we can, like, change those assumptions to actually be the truth.

371
00:41:33,790 --> 00:41:42,040
Okay. Yeah. And I, you know, I think that any time we're if we're truly reflective, we do have to question our own assumptions.

372
00:41:42,490 --> 00:41:46,210
You know, and I think that this holds up nicely with what he was talking about,

373
00:41:46,630 --> 00:41:55,540
how we make a lot of assumptions based on people's appearances, their presentation,

374
00:41:55,840 --> 00:42:04,540
and we don't really think about the potential multi or, you know, kind of multiple factors and the intersectionality that may exist within the person.

375
00:42:04,930 --> 00:42:15,910
You know, we look at people, we look with the perceived gender or gender presentation, we see color, we see hair, we see size, other things like that.

376
00:42:16,150 --> 00:42:20,020
And then we often do make those assumptions about people.

377
00:42:20,020 --> 00:42:26,320
So part of being critical is questioning what else, what else might be part of critical theory.

378
00:42:33,370 --> 00:42:38,980
Yeah. I think being intentional about like your critiques of society.

379
00:42:39,400 --> 00:42:46,270
So like thinking about how different systems in the world like might affect other people and just generally

380
00:42:46,270 --> 00:42:52,270
being like critical I guess about like the systems in our world that how they work and audience type attitudes.

381
00:42:52,630 --> 00:42:58,130
Right. Yeah. And so and I think I like the, the focus on systems because, you know,

382
00:42:58,210 --> 00:43:05,140
sometimes what we do is when we look at different groups that are minoritized or oppressed,

383
00:43:05,590 --> 00:43:10,690
we think about sometimes about the individuals, but not about the systems.

384
00:43:10,930 --> 00:43:14,919
So it's kind of like when you're talking about that intersection of the two and

385
00:43:14,920 --> 00:43:20,020
you look at higher rates of whatever and whatever group like for instance,

386
00:43:20,350 --> 00:43:30,220
until, um, you know, further research was done and Alan Meyer talked about minority stress theory or the minority stress framework,

387
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:35,770
you saw higher rates of mental health distress among LGBT people.

388
00:43:36,040 --> 00:43:43,420
So then people were like, Oh, well, they're just crazy and I don't like to use that term, but that's a term that many of us were called.

389
00:43:43,810 --> 00:43:55,540
So but what we found is that it's all of those layers of oppression and discrimination from being a sexual gender minority,

390
00:43:55,540 --> 00:44:02,469
but then also being a woman, being black, being disabled, all those other things, you know.

391
00:44:02,470 --> 00:44:06,070
So it's a lot more complex.

392
00:44:06,070 --> 00:44:13,389
And and if we don't look at the systems which perpetuate those, we have a tendency to put it on a group and we say,

393
00:44:13,390 --> 00:44:18,190
oh, well, women just this are men just this, are transphobia just this.

394
00:44:18,610 --> 00:44:22,810
And so that system part is really, really important. Any time we're talking about critical theory,

395
00:44:23,410 --> 00:44:29,980
because we really have to think about the systems within which people are functioning or not functioning.

396
00:44:30,130 --> 00:44:34,690
Yeah, right. I think you're my target is what is it all about?

397
00:44:34,960 --> 00:44:38,860
Oh yeah. Because it was irritating me and I turned it off my magical powers.

398
00:44:39,160 --> 00:44:42,160
No wonder if other are.

399
00:44:42,460 --> 00:44:49,380
Hello? Hello. It's another battery. Okay. And I got it with PayPal.

400
00:44:52,110 --> 00:44:59,700
All right. Well, I want to thank you for letting me know. And I talk really loud so the owl can probably pick up here.

401
00:44:59,700 --> 00:45:04,860
I'll just park right here like this. So the thing still freaks me out.

402
00:45:05,250 --> 00:45:09,330
All right. Anything else you think about critical theory?

403
00:45:12,900 --> 00:45:19,380
Yeah. It kind of goes off to point 93 because of the socio archeological.

404
00:45:19,500 --> 00:45:23,070
Right. Exactly. Mean interactions between. Mhm. Yeah.

405
00:45:23,440 --> 00:45:23,669
Yeah.

406
00:45:23,670 --> 00:45:31,560
And I think that you know in public health we talk a lot about socio ecological models and for us a lot of times it's just kind of second nature.

407
00:45:32,040 --> 00:45:36,120
Um, but in other fields and in other areas people don't think like that.

408
00:45:36,480 --> 00:45:40,980
So, and again, it goes back to the systems part and all that stuff is really interwoven.

409
00:45:40,980 --> 00:45:44,560
Thank you so much. And you're glad it didn't come out of the middle.

410
00:45:44,580 --> 00:45:49,260
Yeah, yeah, I know you're nervous when it's your first time talking.

411
00:45:49,260 --> 00:45:54,120
Overall, I can tell you all kinds of things that went wrong in my early days, but I don't freak out.

412
00:45:55,470 --> 00:45:59,700
But. Oh, see, now I lost my train of thought.

413
00:46:00,060 --> 00:46:06,150
Yes, but Serena said that I know this socio technological model and that we do have to look at all those different layers.

414
00:46:06,750 --> 00:46:17,310
All right. So again, in this class, a lot of the readings that we poll are not specifically public health readings,

415
00:46:18,090 --> 00:46:22,620
which hopefully that's a bit of a relief to not just read the same old boring stuff.

416
00:46:23,040 --> 00:46:35,099
It's not more exciting stuff. So Beaumont is one of the the folks who have talked a lot about critical theory and has has offered definitions.

417
00:46:35,100 --> 00:46:45,420
One of their definitions is that when in order for a theory to be critical, it has to seek human emancipation from slavery.

418
00:46:45,900 --> 00:46:53,110
Now, what do you think that means? And it's got a word in there that can be very triggering.

419
00:46:54,010 --> 00:46:57,250
What what what do you think they were talking about in this?

420
00:47:00,940 --> 00:47:10,760
I mean, do you think they're talking about like slavery in the traditional sense of humans since just a guess, but maybe like oppression.

421
00:47:12,200 --> 00:47:21,370
Yeah, yeah. Totally like aligns with Freyre and you know, that whole process that, you know, the slavery is the oppression.

422
00:47:21,380 --> 00:47:25,760
It's a way that people are contained, controlled.

423
00:47:26,150 --> 00:47:33,590
Because if you think about the concept of slavery, it's about controlling, containing, surveilling all those different things.

424
00:47:33,860 --> 00:47:37,040
So that's what they're really talking about also.

425
00:47:37,040 --> 00:47:40,130
And critical theory acts as a liberating influence.

426
00:47:40,220 --> 00:47:47,330
So for a critical theory, you know, we have to think about things that all these multiple levels.

427
00:47:47,330 --> 00:47:55,610
But again, just like when Freire talks about critical consciousness and other forms of liberation,

428
00:47:56,390 --> 00:48:10,790
you have to really work toward some kind of change in order for that emancipation to occur.

429
00:48:11,660 --> 00:48:20,060
And also with, ah, the way we're looking at things, our theories, if we're going to really be working toward liberation,

430
00:48:20,630 --> 00:48:24,320
we have to make sure that one as Fern talks about,

431
00:48:24,320 --> 00:48:31,670
that the people who are oppressed are the ones leading that emancipation, they're leading that liberation.

432
00:48:32,060 --> 00:48:39,410
And then the platform works to create a world which satisfy the needs and powers of human beings, which is pretty self-explanatory.

433
00:48:42,020 --> 00:48:48,890
So any time we have a theory where we're really using that theory as a way to free people,

434
00:48:49,160 --> 00:48:57,950
as a way to not continue the status quo, that's kind of the basic elements of a critical theory.

435
00:48:58,490 --> 00:49:01,820
So can anyone think of a critical theory?

436
00:49:02,780 --> 00:49:11,900
And and this exact point down here is that, you know, if you look at social movements over time, so you look at the civil rights movement,

437
00:49:12,170 --> 00:49:19,550
you look at the disability movement and the ADA, you look at LGBT rights movements, women's movements.

438
00:49:20,060 --> 00:49:28,850
You know, all of these are really based in a critical, theoretical, conceptual way of looking at the world.

439
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:40,960
So what can you think of or can you think of another theory or way of looking at the world that's critical?

440
00:49:41,950 --> 00:49:48,310
Yet these aren't theories. But could you argue that like movements like Black Lives Matter and like me too?

441
00:49:48,610 --> 00:49:53,140
Yeah. Where? Although they were like movements, they still kind of follow, like critical theory.

442
00:49:53,170 --> 00:49:58,840
Yeah, exactly. Yeah, that's a great example. Very good example of kind of common day.

443
00:49:58,990 --> 00:50:06,219
Common day, present day movements then.

444
00:50:06,220 --> 00:50:11,080
Really? Well, let's let's keep going with that. All right. Can I keep talking to you about it?

445
00:50:11,080 --> 00:50:15,610
Or you could. Anxious. So what about, let's say, Black Lives Matter?

446
00:50:15,610 --> 00:50:21,900
What about Black Lives Matter is critical, I guess, like kind of going off to the side.

447
00:50:22,540 --> 00:50:27,190
Yeah, like like the 60 minutes emancipation from slavery.

448
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:31,970
I think part of that is like overcoming oppression, systematic.

449
00:50:32,650 --> 00:50:37,030
And then like another component was like within art, like policing, exactly.

450
00:50:38,320 --> 00:50:44,350
Like eliminating that, like that racist system and rebuilding it.

451
00:50:45,340 --> 00:50:52,840
And then like the second part, like the liberating how big it was, was like through social media and still does.

452
00:50:54,040 --> 00:50:59,679
And the main message was like liberation from like if you want to go into

453
00:50:59,680 --> 00:51:05,319
specific brutality and just overall systemic racism and then like the last part,

454
00:51:05,320 --> 00:51:09,100
like creating a world that satisfies the needs and powers of human beings,

455
00:51:09,490 --> 00:51:19,330
like that main goal of that movement is to work with and for like black Americans and making sure that in the future,

456
00:51:19,330 --> 00:51:25,810
like not being oppressed by systemic racism and the same systems that are in place now.

457
00:51:26,190 --> 00:51:32,930
Right. No, that was excellent. And one thing I would just add to the last point is, is that, you know,

458
00:51:32,940 --> 00:51:40,030
before the Black Lives Matter movement, you know, that movement is and should be led by black Americans.

459
00:51:40,030 --> 00:51:45,040
But it doesn't mean everyone else is off the hook. Right. I mean, we all need to be part of that process.

460
00:51:45,430 --> 00:51:48,940
And so I think with that last one, you know,

461
00:51:48,940 --> 00:51:57,340
we really need to look at the ways in which different people treat each other in order for change to occur.

462
00:51:57,520 --> 00:52:04,599
Because if we if we had a really strong BLM movement, but a bunch of white folks are like, no, I don't believe in that [INAUDIBLE].

463
00:52:04,600 --> 00:52:05,829
I'm going to keep doing what I'm doing.

464
00:52:05,830 --> 00:52:14,860
And the movement can only go so far, but if everyone gets on board, then everyone's needs are being addressed and met in different ways.

465
00:52:15,580 --> 00:52:21,130
Excellent. Anything else? What else is a credible? That word theory going comes people because it gets all academic.

466
00:52:22,360 --> 00:52:32,290
What's another way of thinking or viewing the world which could be considered critical or part of a critical theory?

467
00:52:33,220 --> 00:52:45,970
Yeah. And I think recognizing the power of having recognized it's a resistance.

468
00:52:46,600 --> 00:52:51,159
Yeah. And that's, that is more in the theory kind of realm.

469
00:52:51,160 --> 00:52:55,090
So that's excellent. What else? Yeah.

470
00:52:55,510 --> 00:52:59,610
Reproductive justice. Yeah, exactly. So I'm sorry.

471
00:52:59,650 --> 00:53:03,750
I was like, you know, tell me more about what you were thinking that ties into, like,

472
00:53:03,760 --> 00:53:10,360
the emancipation from slavery because I mean, they just like actually does have roots in like, American slavery, but like,

473
00:53:11,110 --> 00:53:19,599
I guess slavery and oppression in the sense of like forced pregnancy and birth or like not being able to have kids,

474
00:53:19,600 --> 00:53:22,360
like kind of both of those sides of it and like the liberty,

475
00:53:22,360 --> 00:53:29,679
equality of like having choice not to me over your body or your family and like create a world in which satisfies the needs of powers.

476
00:53:29,680 --> 00:53:36,159
Like I think that has it. Like the last part of your book, Justice, where it talks about like these feel like a healthy and safe environment.

477
00:53:36,160 --> 00:53:42,610
So like that's satisfying the needs and power of people to raise their families the way they want to in a safe place.

478
00:53:42,730 --> 00:53:46,059
Excellent job. You both get any pluses, right? Yeah.

479
00:53:46,060 --> 00:53:55,870
If you think about it, it kind of blows me away sometimes. But in this day and age, we have to talk about reproductive justice and the way that we do.

480
00:53:57,820 --> 00:54:04,149
You know, another I just got back again from being in Saint Louis,

481
00:54:04,150 --> 00:54:10,750
which parts of it are kind of scary because it is in Missouri or Missouri or somewhere else, it's called.

482
00:54:11,860 --> 00:54:19,299
But watching ads on TV, you know, when the primaries were going on, there were like scary,

483
00:54:19,300 --> 00:54:28,960
scary as about no gay people vote for me and, you know, a gun in every classroom and all this stuff.

484
00:54:29,230 --> 00:54:34,710
I mean, seriously, the. Those are real things that I am forced to watch.

485
00:54:36,300 --> 00:54:39,950
I guess I could just close my eyes really tight and always. But.

486
00:54:40,240 --> 00:54:44,760
But this time it was really interesting ever. With the election coming up.

487
00:54:45,390 --> 00:54:49,950
There were a lot of them about women's right to choose.

488
00:54:50,190 --> 00:55:04,230
And I would say it was more pro abortion and pro choice and less about, you know, mandating that no exceptions.

489
00:55:04,530 --> 00:55:06,479
And that's what a lot of the commercials were about.

490
00:55:06,480 --> 00:55:13,170
And the same thing going on here is, you know, people who are saying no exceptions are the ones that are being,

491
00:55:13,530 --> 00:55:20,459
you know, kind of dragged through the mud, too. But it was just really interesting because I'm used to like wanting to, you know,

492
00:55:20,460 --> 00:55:24,240
run out of the room when I hear the political ads and now it's changing.

493
00:55:24,930 --> 00:55:28,920
So even in really conservative places, people are talking about reproductive justice.

494
00:55:29,400 --> 00:55:34,380
What's another theory concept idea that's cradle milk salt.

495
00:55:34,500 --> 00:55:39,360
Mine is sort of a question of two things I know from different classes that I've learned,

496
00:55:39,360 --> 00:55:43,440
so I don't know if this will fall into this category, and I don't necessarily agree with that.

497
00:55:43,740 --> 00:55:51,580
But like W.E.B. Dubois, like talented ten theory with that, like 10% of like that,

498
00:55:51,630 --> 00:55:55,230
like the top 10% of the black population is what's going to like liberate us.

499
00:55:55,230 --> 00:56:03,760
And like, they need to be the most educated so that like, we're not under these systems, like and like, would that count as the critical?

500
00:56:04,050 --> 00:56:12,390
That's a really good question. I think that the challenge might be and again, I don't know, you know, I don't obviously don't have all the answers.

501
00:56:12,390 --> 00:56:16,440
But might be that because it's not kind of like liberation for all because

502
00:56:16,440 --> 00:56:20,480
then the people that are waiting for the liberators are not truly liberated.

503
00:56:20,850 --> 00:56:29,429
So I think in that respect I'd probably say it isn't, but I think it's critical in that he was questioning, I mean,

504
00:56:29,430 --> 00:56:37,320
during that time period, the role of black folks in larger society and also the role of black folks in relation to white people.

505
00:56:37,680 --> 00:56:41,270
So I think during his time it could probably be considered that.

506
00:56:41,280 --> 00:56:46,830
But I think upon further reflection you could say that aspects of it are not truly emancipatory.

507
00:56:46,960 --> 00:56:50,130
Yeah, that was our second thing.

508
00:56:50,850 --> 00:56:55,860
Oh, I was just going to talk about I took this class called Black Feminist Approaches

509
00:56:55,860 --> 00:56:59,399
to Health and like the overarching theory of black feminism and like,

510
00:56:59,400 --> 00:57:05,220
how can you imagine, like the company? Like I feel like that's a very that I know for sure is critical theory.

511
00:57:05,250 --> 00:57:06,300
Yeah. Oh totally yeah.

512
00:57:06,480 --> 00:57:17,730
I mean really, if you look at a lot of like critical race theory with intersectionality, a lot of these things really started with black feminism.

513
00:57:17,940 --> 00:57:24,690
You know, really the black feminist scholars, they had their [INAUDIBLE] down, you know, and then other people co-opted it later.

514
00:57:24,690 --> 00:57:27,659
And there all the fights with the white feminists and all that.

515
00:57:27,660 --> 00:57:34,649
But really, if you go back, I mean, the sixties and seventies were like a radical time to really read these things.

516
00:57:34,650 --> 00:57:40,260
And so people know if you haven't read Black Feminist Scholars, I would like digging into that stuff.

517
00:57:40,260 --> 00:57:43,379
I mean, there's some really excellent work.

518
00:57:43,380 --> 00:57:48,330
I mean, they were talking about things back then that were kind of seen as new today.

519
00:57:49,920 --> 00:57:57,899
And I get I get frustrated sometimes when people are like, oh, I'm, you know, I'm bringing critical race theory to public health.

520
00:57:57,900 --> 00:58:10,860
It's like no other people that don't. You know, that one thing that we did and so I'm co-director of a mentoring program for undergrads,

521
00:58:11,040 --> 00:58:18,450
juniors and seniors who are from different underrepresented minority groups in the social behavioral sciences.

522
00:58:19,350 --> 00:58:23,190
And the program is set up to help people get into doctoral training programs.

523
00:58:23,580 --> 00:58:29,190
And so it's based in the Institute for Research on Women and Gender,

524
00:58:29,460 --> 00:58:36,180
and it's all based on a feminist framework of looking at education and identity and all these things.

525
00:58:36,480 --> 00:58:47,820
And when we created our guiding principles, we put in the principles reference to a lot of the black feminist scholars,

526
00:58:48,540 --> 00:58:56,640
because we wanted to make it clear that we didn't come up with this and that we're celebrating their voices, not taking their voices.

527
00:58:57,000 --> 00:59:00,750
You know, and I think we need to do more and more of that, you know, instead of someone saying,

528
00:59:00,750 --> 00:59:06,860
oh, you know, I'm introducing you to this concept that it's just been around for quite a while.

529
00:59:08,520 --> 00:59:15,390
Any other critical? There's a big one to talk about in academic shows all the time.

530
00:59:15,490 --> 00:59:20,219
And this is what you're talking about. I know that's a lot of pressure right after that.

531
00:59:20,220 --> 00:59:24,660
And I had a you know, I was thinking of restorative justice.

532
00:59:24,660 --> 00:59:30,330
Yeah. So like a prison abolition preview and creating more like restorative and rehabilitative.

533
00:59:30,550 --> 00:59:38,400
Systems like that would emancipate people from like oppressiveness of being incarcerated and also liberate them from that stigma.

534
00:59:39,090 --> 00:59:44,610
And it would also like if we have a restorative rehabilitative systems that would like or satisfy the needs of those people.

535
00:59:44,770 --> 00:59:51,000
Versus punitive. Yeah, exactly. Yeah. I wasn't thinking about that then, but that's a great example.

536
00:59:52,230 --> 00:59:57,480
Um, I worked in the justice system for years doing therapy with kids in juvenile justice.

537
00:59:58,110 --> 01:00:02,220
We do horrible, horrible things to kids in the general justice system.

538
01:00:02,430 --> 01:00:12,750
I mean, there there's less regulations around how adolescents in juvenile justice are treated than there are for lab animals in experimental labs.

539
01:00:13,170 --> 01:00:17,340
Like literally when I was in grad school doing rat studies.

540
01:00:17,580 --> 01:00:23,880
We had to take more care of them than we take care of adolescents in juvenile justice.

541
01:00:23,890 --> 01:00:30,150
So if we had more restorative justice, I know like in Chicago several years ago,

542
01:00:31,770 --> 01:00:40,710
the mayor started a whole program of restorative justice in Chicago to try and get it to become more mainstream.

543
01:00:43,710 --> 01:00:47,120
So obviously you have to be what?

544
01:00:47,890 --> 01:01:02,520
Yeah, which is just the idea. A lot of people when they hear about how much racism and how much of our system is a lot of their first things is guilt,

545
01:01:02,910 --> 01:01:06,570
but guilt in the form of like denial.

546
01:01:09,060 --> 01:01:14,970
And that can be channeled towards, you know, helping, like, becoming an ally.

547
01:01:15,030 --> 01:01:23,110
Mm hmm. That people are not fixed. Yeah.

548
01:01:24,060 --> 01:01:33,300
Okay, good. So the one that I was thinking of that no one's got yet is there's been a lot of talk about decolonization.

549
01:01:35,040 --> 01:01:38,580
You know, so decolonize your syllabus, you know, all of kind of things.

550
01:01:38,880 --> 01:01:42,180
That whole concept of decolonization is a critical period.

551
01:01:42,750 --> 01:01:49,200
Right. And it's and I think the the one thing about it is that, unfortunately,

552
01:01:49,200 --> 01:01:55,020
some of these theoretical frameworks are ways of, like in the world, become buzzwords.

553
01:01:55,320 --> 01:02:00,540
And so I heard that, you know, decolonize your syllabus is like, what does that mean?

554
01:02:00,960 --> 01:02:10,350
You know, and then some of the faculty who are really critical are like, Oh, I just have to make sure there's not all white people on my syllabus.

555
01:02:10,710 --> 01:02:14,220
And so they throw on a couple of black authors and like, I'm decolonize.

556
01:02:15,450 --> 01:02:21,150
So it's a lot more work than that. Obviously continue on with the critical theory.

557
01:02:21,540 --> 01:02:29,879
So when we're when we're really looking at a critical theory and a lot of you

558
01:02:29,880 --> 01:02:33,600
brought this up and that's why I wanted to have that discussion before this.

559
01:02:36,780 --> 01:02:40,590
In these theories, we want to decrease domination and increase freedom.

560
01:02:40,620 --> 01:02:51,240
So going back to what Bowman says about emancipation and then also they offer three more

561
01:02:51,480 --> 01:02:55,050
there should be a violent or explain what is wrong with their current social identity.

562
01:02:55,060 --> 01:02:59,750
So a lot of what you talked about does exactly that and should be practical.

563
01:02:59,760 --> 01:03:07,499
Identify the actors to change it. And that's the thing is like sometimes when when we talk about theory, people just kind of shut down because like,

564
01:03:07,500 --> 01:03:15,720
oh, that's, you know, stuff up here and there, that esoteric stuff that no one really can connect with.

565
01:03:16,080 --> 01:03:24,690
But, but really, for us, one thing about a lot of the critical theories is that it is more practical and that it identifies what needs to happen.

566
01:03:25,110 --> 01:03:33,480
So again, Black Lives Matter. What do white people tend to what to black people do when people of other races need to do and norm.

567
01:03:33,720 --> 01:03:40,350
So it should provide clear norms for criticism and achievable practical goals for trans social transformation.

568
01:03:40,920 --> 01:03:45,990
Again, it's, you know, all going kind of back to two freres work.

569
01:03:46,380 --> 01:03:55,770
It's one thing to recognize the challenges and the issues and the levels of oppression, but without action, you're wasting your time.

570
01:03:56,100 --> 01:04:00,659
You're really just making people more depressed. It's like your life is [INAUDIBLE], you know?

571
01:04:00,660 --> 01:04:04,110
People are controlling you. People are making you feel bad.

572
01:04:04,110 --> 01:04:06,930
Have a nice day. Doesn't feel so good.

573
01:04:07,290 --> 01:04:15,360
So, you know, one thing that is critical and critical theory is when we're thinking about things through this critical lens,

574
01:04:15,600 --> 01:04:23,940
we are thinking about what can we actually do versus just kind of empty rhetoric.

575
01:04:25,170 --> 01:04:35,370
So what does critical theory have to do with public health? I said, I'm tired of you guys reading about public health authors and your other classes.

576
01:04:38,250 --> 01:04:42,450
I'm trying to create an army of public health professionals that are going to turn the world upside down.

577
01:04:42,960 --> 01:04:45,450
But you know what? What does this have to do with anything?

578
01:04:46,980 --> 01:04:52,350
You know, I think that within public health, when you're looking at like health disparities and health inequities,

579
01:04:52,350 --> 01:05:00,510
you really have to use critical theory because you're looking at like what really is the cause of these within like the systems of our society.

580
01:05:00,540 --> 01:05:09,719
So I think that like within public health, even, like, I guess like whatever work you do within public health, you have to, I think,

581
01:05:09,720 --> 01:05:16,049
use critical theory in order to understand, especially if you're working in a community directly with like people from that community,

582
01:05:16,050 --> 01:05:20,280
you have to really understand like systematically what has been going on,

583
01:05:20,370 --> 01:05:27,120
like cause these issues or like what has been going on so that we can work to like better society right now.

584
01:05:29,940 --> 01:05:41,030
Yeah. If you think about it, too, if we if we don't do that, I mean, if public health kept doing what it always does and didn't take a critical lens,

585
01:05:41,040 --> 01:05:45,570
didn't take a critical line, you know, the field could keep going.

586
01:05:45,840 --> 01:05:52,770
And in some areas of medicine, this happens where people use the same diagnostic criteria that were created,

587
01:05:53,460 --> 01:05:57,540
you know, with primarily white, cisgender, heteronormative standards.

588
01:05:57,810 --> 01:06:02,970
And then the treatments are the same and they just keep perpetuating that over and over and over again.

589
01:06:04,710 --> 01:06:08,190
We can do that really easily in public health, right? We could keep getting grants.

590
01:06:08,190 --> 01:06:13,920
We could keep getting funding at the health departments by showing, oh, look, here's health inequities.

591
01:06:14,070 --> 01:06:18,000
Well, actually, we wanted to perpetuate we look at health disparities, not inequities.

592
01:06:18,540 --> 01:06:21,780
And so we say, oh, look, women have higher rates of this.

593
01:06:22,440 --> 01:06:27,480
Gay people have higher rates of this. People with different abilities have higher rates of this and that.

594
01:06:27,810 --> 01:06:29,940
And we can keep going for quite a while.

595
01:06:31,170 --> 01:06:41,220
And really, if you think about it, if we're not critical, a lot of times public health as a system can become oppressive.

596
01:06:42,060 --> 01:06:44,460
Now, how can public health as a system be oppressive?

597
01:06:46,020 --> 01:06:52,040
And a million something I'm thinking is like, if the goal of critical theory is to decrease domination and increase freedom,

598
01:06:52,080 --> 01:06:57,389
like public health needs to acknowledge that, like as cultural practitioners, our role is not to tell people what to do,

599
01:06:57,390 --> 01:07:01,560
but to like give them the resources and freedom to make choices that are right for them.

600
01:07:01,560 --> 01:07:07,860
Right. So, like, I think public health can be oppressive and dominating when we come from it.

601
01:07:08,490 --> 01:07:09,660
We have our own approach of like,

602
01:07:09,660 --> 01:07:17,320
I'm educated and I know what's the right answer and not like understand that there really isn't always like one right interpret.

603
01:07:17,400 --> 01:07:23,879
Right. Yeah. And I wouldn't even say that some public health interventions are not only oppressive,

604
01:07:23,880 --> 01:07:32,520
but they're also manipulative because they're giving they're doing what the deliverer of the services wants or what the funder wants.

605
01:07:33,570 --> 01:07:37,760
And in that way, it does take away your freedoms. Yeah.

606
01:07:38,480 --> 01:07:41,360
Something to kind of unfortunate and the idea of like saviors.

607
01:07:41,360 --> 01:07:45,610
I'm like, yeah, consistently just like only doing it like sending a resource and then like,

608
01:07:46,010 --> 01:07:50,720
like giving resources to people like this and then not explaining it like stuff along those lines.

609
01:07:50,750 --> 01:07:54,620
A lot of the times people think if people just like throw resources into different

610
01:07:54,620 --> 01:07:59,919
communities or just have them like available there without like consistent dialog around it,

611
01:07:59,920 --> 01:08:09,380
that it'll change when in actuality, like, I think like someone like totally just wants like the best leaders are the ones that are replaceable.

612
01:08:09,720 --> 01:08:15,020
No, because we have this idea sometimes that like we have such extraordinary leaders, those are the ones that are like the best.

613
01:08:15,020 --> 01:08:20,270
But in reality, like it's creating sustainable systems and resources so that like these communities

614
01:08:20,270 --> 01:08:25,370
can help create like we can create real relationships rather than a hierarchy.

615
01:08:25,400 --> 01:08:26,389
Yeah. Yeah.

616
01:08:26,390 --> 01:08:35,570
And one thing that, you know, especially in my global work, I mean, I my goal is to work myself out of a job, you know, to not be there any longer.

617
01:08:35,570 --> 01:08:41,330
So we have programs that, you know, our team has created that are still running and we're no longer there.

618
01:08:41,330 --> 01:08:48,110
And that's how it should be, because it's not my country. It's not, you know, where I'm from and I don't live there.

619
01:08:48,110 --> 01:08:53,480
So we do need to, you know, basically work herself out of a job.

620
01:08:54,020 --> 01:09:01,160
But, you know, some programs, people keep their job by people being sick, right.

621
01:09:01,640 --> 01:09:03,320
Or by people not improving.

622
01:09:03,980 --> 01:09:12,830
And I think the savior ism, I think, is an important point, too, because some people are going into it because it feels good to help other people.

623
01:09:13,850 --> 01:09:17,540
And if you again, if you're credible about that and look at the root causes of that,

624
01:09:17,930 --> 01:09:26,600
some of that may be that they're really in it for themselves to feel good and not thinking critically about, well, what does this do for someone else?

625
01:09:27,170 --> 01:09:33,620
And I don't think that, you know, obviously, I don't think that everyone in what we call does is doing that, like, oh, look at me,

626
01:09:33,620 --> 01:09:44,329
I did this really good thing because I think that we are indoctrinated and taught that, you know, if we do things for others that that's good.

627
01:09:44,330 --> 01:09:51,020
And without thinking about whether or not others want it or needed or like you were saying, you know,

628
01:09:51,020 --> 01:09:56,030
you can have all these resources, but if I don't know how to use them, you know, you just waste it all the time.

629
01:09:56,360 --> 01:10:01,670
And again, for folks interested in global work, that happens all the time.

630
01:10:01,970 --> 01:10:10,700
Now, I can't even tell you how many places I've been in sub-Saharan Africa where there are resources that have been spent and exist,

631
01:10:10,700 --> 01:10:12,070
but no one knows how to use them.

632
01:10:12,080 --> 01:10:24,950
Equipment that isn't is unused, supplies that go rotten, other things, because there's no capacity sharing process where people can actually use it.

633
01:10:25,970 --> 01:10:31,620
Why else is critical, very important in public office. Yeah.

634
01:10:33,900 --> 01:10:39,299
I was thinking of like a specific example of like I know in the Flint case, like it wasn't until very,

635
01:10:39,300 --> 01:10:43,140
very late that like a lot of the documents were translated into, like, Spanish.

636
01:10:43,140 --> 01:10:54,020
Yes, exactly. In Arabic. And. If you're not critical in public health, then you end up widening health disparities and furthering oppression.

637
01:10:54,410 --> 01:11:01,520
Yeah. Yeah. And sometimes it is. You know, that's not a tough task to translate, right?

638
01:11:01,790 --> 01:11:08,240
I mean, doesn't you know, it doesn't cost a ton of money to have everything translated.

639
01:11:09,860 --> 01:11:17,720
But that's part of that domination of public health when people come into places and I've seen this a disaster relief.

640
01:11:17,990 --> 01:11:23,390
So I've been lucky enough to be able to be involved in disaster relief work.

641
01:11:24,320 --> 01:11:31,790
I was in Haiti after the earthquake in 2010, and it was devastating.

642
01:11:31,790 --> 01:11:39,770
I mean, it was it was I've never experienced anything like that and truly had some PTSD after that because, you know,

643
01:11:39,830 --> 01:11:45,770
we were in places where buildings were literally falling as we were trying to provide mental health support.

644
01:11:47,030 --> 01:11:56,270
But one thing I saw in there, I got so disgusted when I was there because so many people came in from around the globe,

645
01:11:56,600 --> 01:12:00,049
you know, because it was a devastating earthquake.

646
01:12:00,050 --> 01:12:07,160
And they even had this camp for all the people that were coming in and mostly the camp.

647
01:12:07,160 --> 01:12:09,020
Everyone spoke English.

648
01:12:10,730 --> 01:12:23,120
There were not representatives from the communities there, and most of the people that were heavily impacted only spoke Haitian Creole.

649
01:12:23,810 --> 01:12:26,030
So having all these, you know,

650
01:12:26,030 --> 01:12:34,729
English speaking people taking up all this space really didn't do [INAUDIBLE] because you might have these services that are available,

651
01:12:34,730 --> 01:12:38,629
but they weren't translatable, you know, and and also Haitian Creole.

652
01:12:38,630 --> 01:12:44,870
Not as many people know that. So it's not and if you know French, you can kind of get around it.

653
01:12:44,870 --> 01:12:55,940
But, you know, it was really just kind of a to me, a really grotesque kind of misuse of money and resources.

654
01:12:56,870 --> 01:12:57,760
And, you know,

655
01:12:58,060 --> 01:13:05,510
I remember being in the camp when we first got there and I went to some of the they had different groups that were addressing different issues.

656
01:13:05,510 --> 01:13:10,219
So there was like mental health, there was like water, food, sanitation, all these things.

657
01:13:10,220 --> 01:13:18,980
So I went to the mental health group and you know, this was actually the first time I did like major global disaster work.

658
01:13:19,370 --> 01:13:26,270
And so I was expecting to be honored, you know, by all these people because the U.N. was there and, you know, relief workers from all over the world.

659
01:13:27,290 --> 01:13:31,009
And I sit in the meeting and it was like basic [INAUDIBLE].

660
01:13:31,010 --> 01:13:34,339
They didn't know, you know, they're like, well, we need to do this, this or that.

661
01:13:34,340 --> 01:13:37,130
I'm like, okay, well, where the where are the Haitians?

662
01:13:37,460 --> 01:13:45,650
Because everyone was either a white person or a black American or someone from France or, you know, different places.

663
01:13:46,760 --> 01:13:51,790
And they're like, oh, well, we have this one person who was there,

664
01:13:51,790 --> 01:13:59,840
their kind of token Haitian who was from an academic institution and not really connected to the hardest hit communities in Port au Prince.

665
01:14:00,380 --> 01:14:01,840
And, you know,

666
01:14:01,890 --> 01:14:11,460
we talk about different ways of doing like assessment and trying to work with local like faith leaders and other people in the community to start to.

667
01:14:13,220 --> 01:14:16,220
Teach them about some of the mental health,

668
01:14:16,940 --> 01:14:25,040
some psychological first day that's used a lot in trauma and went back the second day and they still it was so disorganized.

669
01:14:25,370 --> 01:14:33,800
Still no Haitians, nothing in Creole, all this stuff. And so we actually laughed because it was just really a horrific misuse.

670
01:14:34,250 --> 01:14:39,649
And our team actually and everyone except for me spoke Haitian Creole that worked in Haiti for a long

671
01:14:39,650 --> 01:14:46,550
time because was an organization that had worked in Haiti with children that have had HIV for 20 years.

672
01:14:46,970 --> 01:14:50,300
So we went off and just kind of went on our own.

673
01:14:50,600 --> 01:14:56,870
And so we did trainings around different areas when people who were different types

674
01:14:56,870 --> 01:15:03,919
of providers on basic skills around detecting and addressing post-traumatic stress,

675
01:15:03,920 --> 01:15:12,290
trauma, things like that. But you know, and we were like a little organization and you know, we were all I didn't get paid anything.

676
01:15:12,290 --> 01:15:14,120
No one I was with was getting paid.

677
01:15:14,510 --> 01:15:20,959
Some of these other groups had people that this was their full time job, you know, and they brought all these resources in.

678
01:15:20,960 --> 01:15:25,010
And it was really, I think, a waste of money and a lot of ways, you know.

679
01:15:25,010 --> 01:15:30,200
And so I think a lot of those people were thinking, oh, we did such a great thing.

680
01:15:30,200 --> 01:15:33,890
You know, we we saved the Haitians and all this crap. You didn't do [INAUDIBLE].

681
01:15:34,190 --> 01:15:43,250
And a lot of ways they made it worse by having the savior mentality and not working together.

682
01:15:43,730 --> 01:15:51,740
So people then were feeling like, Oh, well, we can't do anything on our own because we need these people to come in and, you know, save us.

683
01:15:52,100 --> 01:15:58,270
So, you know, I would encourage how many people are interested in global work or might be okay.

684
01:15:58,320 --> 01:16:05,120
So fair number. Yeah. I mean, when we're talking about global public health, everything here applies.

685
01:16:05,330 --> 01:16:18,740
But I would ramp it up about 500 times because this the history of colonization, the history of the U.S. coming in and doing good is pretty horrific.

686
01:16:19,550 --> 01:16:30,890
All right. Well, why don't we start with the river run possibilities and we will see you on Thursday.

687
01:16:30,890 --> 01:16:34,850
Don't forget to bring your identity inventory, which can be all right.

688
01:16:34,850 --> 01:16:44,450
We'll talk right now, see what it's about on the Wednesday after and most likely on me.
