1
00:00:12,070 --> 00:00:19,870
Okay. Good morning, everyone. So next Monday, we're having your midterm exam.

2
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:33,450
And so as we speak I am posting materials for it and I will do my best to be done with everything by the end of today.

3
00:00:37,150 --> 00:00:41,410
So let's take a look at what's already in there.

4
00:00:44,560 --> 00:00:49,030
So on the exams, on the canvas.

5
00:00:50,870 --> 00:00:53,100
Sphere projecting from one.

6
00:01:42,054 --> 00:01:51,234
Okay. So the files on the canvas midterm and then.

7
00:01:52,314 --> 00:01:56,554
Okay. So right there you have exam info.

8
00:01:56,574 --> 00:02:02,334
So that's kind of a short description of the format of the exams.

9
00:02:02,334 --> 00:02:07,194
And I'll give you a better idea because later today, when I'm done through,

10
00:02:07,734 --> 00:02:14,064
when I'm gone through the materials, I'll just give you a mock exam, which is one of the past exams.

11
00:02:14,694 --> 00:02:22,194
And I want you to try so mainly to see if you have enough time and if you have any questions.

12
00:02:22,524 --> 00:02:31,224
There's also set of problems after that. So I don't expect you to kind of do everything like you do in the exam.

13
00:02:31,224 --> 00:02:37,014
Just get an idea whether you know how to do it, whether you have any questions, and we'll go over them right away.

14
00:02:38,284 --> 00:02:45,474
Um, also, you get a pretty good idea of the, the points distribution, the format of the exam and so on.

15
00:02:47,144 --> 00:02:55,944
Uh, okay. So let's see. So we have, uh, so that's on Monday, October 24th.

16
00:02:56,064 --> 00:03:05,454
Uh, during the class time. So it, it'll start at, uh, ten sharp and uh, will finish at 1120.

17
00:03:07,134 --> 00:03:12,344
Uh, now, like I said, there are problems and solutions posted on canvas.

18
00:03:12,354 --> 00:03:17,604
I'll go over them, over these materials in just a minute.

19
00:03:19,034 --> 00:03:24,863
Uh, so in general, it will be similar to practice materials,

20
00:03:24,864 --> 00:03:32,034
so there will be a bunch of theoretical problems where I just ask you the question to state some fact from

21
00:03:32,034 --> 00:03:40,614
the lectures or to interpret something based on the lecture material or to provide a proof of something.

22
00:03:42,144 --> 00:03:47,784
And then the last thing on the exam will be a problem, uh, you know,

23
00:03:47,874 --> 00:03:54,534
which is kind of broadly similar to the ones we encountered in the homework in practice.

24
00:03:55,254 --> 00:04:05,904
And so the set of problems that I'm posting is, is pretty representative of what's going to be there at the exam.

25
00:04:06,594 --> 00:04:12,624
Um, so I haven't designed it yet, but, and basically looking at the practice problems to do that.

26
00:04:25,754 --> 00:04:30,854
Okay then. So it's a closed book and closed everything.

27
00:04:30,854 --> 00:04:35,624
So you're allowed one cheat sheet. Double sided.

28
00:04:35,984 --> 00:04:47,354
You can put anything you want on it. Uh, my suggestion would be to just put the main idea of a proof or a fact to get you started at the right time.

29
00:04:47,354 --> 00:04:59,174
Uh, so it would be, uh, concise and, uh, I'm sure you can fill in the details once, uh, you get started.

30
00:05:00,114 --> 00:05:06,524
Yeah, you have the idea, so don't waste the cheat sheet on unnecessary details.

31
00:05:08,054 --> 00:05:11,104
Uh, okay.

32
00:05:11,114 --> 00:05:16,364
And then the advice I, uh, I've already given to you at the beginning of this course.

33
00:05:16,934 --> 00:05:23,974
So when you're just looking at the notes, uh, books or whatever solutions and you have,

34
00:05:23,984 --> 00:05:27,974
uh, you typically have an initial impression that you understand everything.

35
00:05:28,574 --> 00:05:35,504
So that's impression is not enough, uh, to, to get through a closed book exam.

36
00:05:36,464 --> 00:05:44,624
Uh, so what it takes is actually, uh, well, leaving the materials at the point you seem to understand it,

37
00:05:45,254 --> 00:05:51,434
uh, give it a washout period and then take a clean sheet of paper and try to reproduce it.

38
00:05:52,274 --> 00:05:56,353
Yeah. And so the first time around, you will get stuck a couple of times,

39
00:05:56,354 --> 00:06:01,814
but then returning to it and repeating the exercise will actually bring you in the right shape.

40
00:06:06,384 --> 00:06:14,424
Okay. So that's the one thing. Then what's there already for the practice?

41
00:06:15,294 --> 00:06:21,534
So I have the past midterm. Uh, I have it here.

42
00:06:21,624 --> 00:06:24,844
Uh. Print ads.

43
00:06:25,084 --> 00:06:29,254
So I'm going to give it to you in just a few minutes.

44
00:06:30,074 --> 00:06:39,484
Right. So this is the actual exam that your previous colleagues had the year before then.

45
00:06:40,384 --> 00:06:44,074
So they're midterm practice problems.

46
00:06:44,374 --> 00:06:55,324
So that comes after the exam. And so none of these is with solutions yet, but they will certainly post the solutions once you get a chance to try.

47
00:06:57,334 --> 00:07:00,574
To trade them.

48
00:07:01,834 --> 00:07:07,654
So there are four problems there. It could overlap with the exam a little bit with the last problem of the exam.

49
00:07:08,554 --> 00:07:18,134
Well, that's not big of a problem. But it should give you a good idea of what type of problems will be there for the worse thing.

50
00:07:20,274 --> 00:07:25,794
Then. So there's a practice right here.

51
00:07:27,114 --> 00:07:31,884
And there's also. In the solutions.

52
00:07:31,884 --> 00:07:38,514
There is a solution to the near term 2020, which we are not looking at yet.

53
00:07:45,784 --> 00:07:51,244
So this is part of the practice and is the practice solution solutions as well?

54
00:07:53,404 --> 00:07:56,854
So when I'm looking at them, it's either. Right.

55
00:07:56,854 --> 00:08:01,524
So try to do it without. Looking at them.

56
00:08:03,144 --> 00:08:09,204
Okay. So what is still to come is.

57
00:08:09,564 --> 00:08:16,674
So there will be a document summarizing how you did with the whole works, uh, with typical problems there.

58
00:08:17,124 --> 00:08:26,413
So that's coming today. And also, I'm finishing up a document with page numbers and various facts from the lectures.

59
00:08:26,414 --> 00:08:33,504
So it's kind of an intermediate between an index file and a table of contents.

60
00:08:34,434 --> 00:08:38,154
And this is also coming today. Okay.

61
00:08:38,244 --> 00:08:46,204
So with that. So let me just give you. Bunch of stuff you can try.

62
00:08:49,274 --> 00:08:53,414
So it did not collate things, so I probably have to just walk.

63
00:08:55,614 --> 00:09:01,444
And we gave it to you. So try to.

64
00:09:04,684 --> 00:09:11,344
To approach this as if we are at the exam and see if you have any trouble.

65
00:09:31,274 --> 00:09:35,824
Please pass behind. I'm the one.

66
00:10:39,314 --> 00:10:42,824
Now during the real exam, you can ask me questions.

67
00:10:43,184 --> 00:10:49,814
Occasionally there are glitches in the problem in the text of the exam and problems as well.

68
00:10:49,824 --> 00:10:58,034
So I'm going to resolve those and I'm going to write B the how I do it and it will be feasible for everybody.

69
00:10:58,664 --> 00:11:09,074
So today, because it's not a real exam. So you are encouraged to ask me questions as you go along and we will interrupt for those questions.

70
00:11:09,464 --> 00:12:08,404
Okay. And as you look at the format of the exam, you will notice that it has 60 points total and 50 is enough for.

71
00:12:11,114 --> 00:12:16,154
Kind of a perfect score. So that leaves some room for extra credit if you want to.

72
00:12:17,944 --> 00:12:21,394
Address it or drop a problem that you don't like.

73
00:12:22,594 --> 00:12:25,744
So I haven't decided what to do yet, but it's definitely.

74
00:12:27,144 --> 00:12:34,193
Uh, so little more points in the exam than is actually required for.

75
00:12:34,194 --> 00:12:39,234
And they. So you have some flexibility.

76
00:12:43,434 --> 00:12:47,814
So if I find the problem hard enough, I will put it as an extra credit one.

77
00:12:49,494 --> 00:12:57,444
If I don't find a suitable problem, then it's just going to be a choice for you to drop some ten points.

78
00:12:59,044 --> 00:48:35,754
On a problem you don't like. This link is.

79
00:48:37,224 --> 00:48:44,104
Means that eventually every single interview will be happening, right?

80
00:48:44,184 --> 00:48:51,444
Starting from something. That includes him as part of it.

81
00:48:51,504 --> 00:48:55,914
Right. It follows from that that infinitely many things will be happening.

82
00:48:57,354 --> 00:49:01,464
Right now is thinking too many things happening.

83
00:49:04,514 --> 00:49:10,454
Right. So if he belongs to one and then follows that it belongs to another one.

84
00:49:11,884 --> 00:49:21,004
Then the first event is a subset of the. That's how subsets are defined.

85
00:49:21,024 --> 00:49:24,864
Right? So if you have two events.

86
00:49:25,524 --> 00:49:32,794
Let's see if my. What does it mean?

87
00:49:32,794 --> 00:49:42,664
There is a subsidy that means for Kenny Omega in the b e follows that it is also in the.

88
00:49:44,164 --> 00:49:47,664
Right. So for any comic in this one.

89
00:49:50,034 --> 00:49:57,264
It follows that it's also in this one because for anyone reading this one,

90
00:49:58,164 --> 00:50:04,044
then all of the cases are happening starting from some end, and in particular infinitely many of them are happening.

91
00:50:05,094 --> 00:50:09,024
Then this is okay. This on it is also part of this one.

92
00:50:12,164 --> 00:50:17,854
Do you think are? Decrease. This one.

93
00:50:19,104 --> 00:50:23,734
This. This one is decreasing.

94
00:50:27,084 --> 00:50:36,044
Like this. The intersection of all of things is just the car that you see in the middle.

95
00:50:41,624 --> 00:50:45,044
Mm. Right.

96
00:50:45,064 --> 00:50:49,654
That's that's whatever it approaches is it's expanding.

97
00:50:52,234 --> 00:50:58,304
Perhaps. This one?

98
00:50:58,794 --> 00:57:18,234
No, no, this is correct. Yep. Okay. It's.

99
00:57:30,444 --> 00:58:03,914
What do you say? Them. Right.

100
00:58:04,124 --> 00:58:09,844
So you could say it's mid-teens. And then it's the teens who come.

101
00:58:33,154 --> 00:58:36,234
Well, I guess it's the interpretation of this language.

102
00:58:40,994 --> 00:58:44,554
If you interpret this, he says he's the one.

103
00:58:45,604 --> 00:58:53,324
He's always negative. Oh, yeah. All right.

104
00:58:53,554 --> 00:59:03,334
Yeah. I mean, this there's always things like that in with problems where you can be like a police state, how you feel.

105
00:59:03,574 --> 00:59:06,804
There is ambiguity there. If.

106
00:59:09,484 --> 00:59:13,714
All of them. Right? Without exception.

107
00:59:13,864 --> 01:02:05,604
Yeah. On the other way. Okay.

108
01:02:05,614 --> 01:02:08,704
I'm not getting as many questions as as expected.

109
01:02:09,364 --> 01:02:14,864
Is everything trivial? Don't hesitate.

110
01:02:15,734 --> 01:02:25,504
And the more you ask me, the better. What's what's the hardest thing?

111
01:02:34,424 --> 01:02:42,904
Definitions. Okay. Definitions.

112
01:02:48,454 --> 01:02:54,304
So what about the time? So the exam without the extra list of problems.

113
01:02:54,334 --> 01:02:57,964
Is it reasonable for an hour and 20 minutes?

114
01:02:58,564 --> 01:03:08,004
What do you think? I take silence as a yes.

115
01:03:11,624 --> 01:03:16,274
So you need to raise your voice. You disagree?

116
01:03:19,534 --> 01:03:26,594
Then the thing that's happening with questions is approximately what will be happening of the exam, right?

117
01:03:26,854 --> 01:03:31,354
So whenever somebody asks me, I write something about it.

118
01:03:31,894 --> 01:03:42,134
Unless it's. I will first thing if I can do that, because I want to stop short of solving the problem for you.

119
01:03:42,824 --> 01:03:50,474
Of course. Right. But if it's just a clarification, I will write them down and let everybody see that.

120
01:03:58,034 --> 01:04:07,004
So on Friday at 4 p.m., we will have office hours and I will stay as long as it takes.

121
01:04:07,124 --> 01:04:16,934
So bring all your questions because this will give you some time to digest what happened today and perhaps the closer.

122
01:04:17,504 --> 01:04:22,694
I don't know how you work on the exam, so I'm always a last minute person with everything.

123
01:04:22,994 --> 01:04:30,404
So if you are like me, it makes sense to have a discussion as close as possible to the exam.

124
01:04:33,704 --> 01:04:39,884
Also, if you feel you need to meet for office hours during the weekend, I'm fine with that.

125
01:04:40,094 --> 01:05:04,054
Just shoot me an email. If you think you are dumb, you can leave.

126
01:05:06,704 --> 01:05:11,024
If you think there are any simmering questions, I ask them.

127
01:05:41,494 --> 01:05:44,764
So you want to contribute to the list of things you find hard.

128
01:07:55,664 --> 01:08:09,224
Now, one of the notes that I tried to put here up on the screen is that sometimes problems have wiggle room for you to specify certain things.

129
01:08:10,064 --> 01:08:20,474
Right. So there's either ambiguity or you need to actually define a specific probability space before you can solve it.

130
01:08:21,344 --> 01:08:29,834
Yeah, there is some options how to do it and it can it can be done in a non unique way.

131
01:08:30,044 --> 01:08:35,894
Right. So don't be puzzled about things like that.

132
01:08:36,284 --> 01:08:40,064
Just go ahead and define it the way you want within the.

133
01:08:41,624 --> 01:08:44,924
What the text of the problem allows you to do, right?

134
01:08:45,554 --> 01:08:50,564
So that's totally acceptable. If you want to run it by me, you can always ask a question.

135
01:08:53,354 --> 01:08:58,734
Yeah. Right.

136
01:08:59,304 --> 01:09:10,014
Three material is not from the exam. So a good idea of what's on the exam is.

137
01:09:10,584 --> 01:09:14,964
So I told you, I'm making collated lectures and list of topics with pages.

138
01:09:15,294 --> 01:09:21,504
So that's that's what, what we'll go into the exams and that's lectures one through 13.

139
01:10:19,634 --> 01:10:24,494
Okay. So I guess your quiet.

140
01:10:26,214 --> 01:10:32,514
So we can end here. I'll let you digest it and bring your stuff on Friday.
