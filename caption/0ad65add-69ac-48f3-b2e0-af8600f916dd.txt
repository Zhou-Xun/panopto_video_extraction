1
00:00:01,410 --> 00:00:19,000
Okay. Brilliant. Get started. I want to know.

2
00:00:19,090 --> 00:00:23,560
So you see this sitting so I can see what I'm talking about in my head all the time.

3
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:27,370
Just make settings duplicate. Okay.

4
00:00:27,850 --> 00:00:34,360
So basically, as I said last time, I view the first lecture as kind of a meet and greet.

5
00:00:35,170 --> 00:00:43,360
Many of you actually introduce yourselves as a group. And we want to emphasize again that I view this at the roundtable.

6
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:48,760
The nice roundtable would be all interacting with each other. I value everyone turning up.

7
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:54,010
I don't mind if you're a little bit later to come in, but I know we all come across on campus in different places.

8
00:00:55,030 --> 00:00:58,630
I try to get here a few minutes beforehand, get set up.

9
00:00:59,740 --> 00:01:02,700
Definitely a start as soon as we can. Um.

10
00:01:04,760 --> 00:01:11,920
With that in mind, I also want to say that you'll come from different places and some of you might have some sort of anti-microbial background.

11
00:01:11,930 --> 00:01:14,839
Feel free to put some thoughts into post as we start sketching things.

12
00:01:14,840 --> 00:01:22,940
Because what I say today or tomorrow or next, next week or the following week is, is the literature is evolving as we go.

13
00:01:25,010 --> 00:01:28,190
I just had a meeting and you were talking about different kinds of anti-microbial,

14
00:01:28,490 --> 00:01:33,350
how the definition has changed over time that essentially can be cognizant of.

15
00:01:33,350 --> 00:01:37,579
And actually, when you start thinking about later, when we start talking about new technologies,

16
00:01:37,580 --> 00:01:41,510
think about what are we actually really talking about? Definitions.

17
00:01:41,810 --> 00:01:47,320
My grandfather used to say glossary and I want to talk about that today before I even get there.

18
00:01:47,540 --> 00:01:52,550
Look, you are coming in and you can come on to anyone, not introduce themselves.

19
00:01:53,630 --> 00:01:56,630
He wasn't here last in Trenton. You weren't here last time. Are you out of time?

20
00:01:56,810 --> 00:02:02,390
So I'd like to say whoever wasn't here, as you introduce the group the first week,

21
00:02:02,600 --> 00:02:06,110
I know it's you all like I was juggling glasses, trying to figure stuff out.

22
00:02:06,410 --> 00:02:12,020
So, you know, whether you stay in the class, I hope you do. If you don't, then that's fine.

23
00:02:12,020 --> 00:02:16,070
But as you're coming in, it'd be nice that everyone gets to know who you are.

24
00:02:16,340 --> 00:02:20,270
So continue to question. Want me to read? To say something about yourself?

25
00:02:20,270 --> 00:02:26,840
Everyone knows. Yeah, I'm trying to be canon. I'm a second year master of public health and hospital molecular epidemiology.

26
00:02:27,390 --> 00:02:32,320
My background's in biochemist human biology. Um, anything else?

27
00:02:32,330 --> 00:02:37,520
Fun fact about myself. I know I'm a massive Argentina fan, so I was very happy to do that again.

28
00:02:37,940 --> 00:02:50,240
I was miserable. We got beaten by France and then tragedy before the football season either didn't beat us.

29
00:02:50,250 --> 00:03:00,229
I'll tell you again that a strategy that works and who likes to introduce themselves.

30
00:03:00,230 --> 00:03:03,680
Thank you, gentlemen. Hello. My name is Rick Venus.

31
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:11,659
I'm a first year student pharmacy and the pharmacy D.M. grad back in Puerto Rico, where I.

32
00:03:11,660 --> 00:03:14,810
Well, I used to live here last year.

33
00:03:17,240 --> 00:03:21,620
Well, welcome. Any fun facts? I think you've actually living facts.

34
00:03:24,920 --> 00:03:28,300
I was a dear friend. Sadly, they lost.

35
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:33,959
I lost everything you have to say to me.

36
00:03:33,960 --> 00:03:36,680
And by the way, you dropped the ball and as you put it, soccer.

37
00:03:36,680 --> 00:03:43,070
Over here in England, we say every time American says soccer in English football it dies anyway anyway.

38
00:03:44,450 --> 00:03:51,080
If anyone asks, you go. So I myself, the Palestinian, the undergraduate public health sciences major.

39
00:03:54,330 --> 00:03:57,030
I'm from New York and I got a phone.

40
00:03:57,630 --> 00:04:03,120
I was late on Thursday, like in New York because like three different airports within like 20 miles of each other.

41
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:06,930
And I went to the wrong one so that I was like like in business class.

42
00:04:07,900 --> 00:04:11,610
Oh, no. We're actually in New York, I think. Brooklyn. Brooklyn.

43
00:04:11,610 --> 00:04:14,750
Okay, fantastic. Welcome to the beginning.

44
00:04:16,020 --> 00:04:27,210
Uh, my name's Andrew. I mean, it's like an MBA student in the General Assembly track, and I'm from 45, and I know how to finance, finance.

45
00:04:27,420 --> 00:04:32,460
And for one day before, in my undergrad and my undergrad, I did more.

46
00:04:33,660 --> 00:04:38,240
Wow. I actually do know finances. I mean, honestly, I mean I mean,

47
00:04:38,280 --> 00:04:45,839
that's when you think of the the theme from this where one of the lucky ones could

48
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:51,090
good players on the end for this and I said wow that's kind of a dangerous to me.

49
00:04:52,430 --> 00:04:55,680
Yeah, well, you're welcome.

50
00:04:55,980 --> 00:05:00,510
So that's kind of what I'm hoping that we'll be back the same numbers now.

51
00:05:01,380 --> 00:05:03,540
And if every new comes in, we're going to introduce themselves.

52
00:05:03,540 --> 00:05:11,550
But obviously the big thing I was pushing before and again is I really am I really am excited that I'm having from different backgrounds,

53
00:05:11,820 --> 00:05:16,170
culturally, academically, all these sort of different perspectives.

54
00:05:17,940 --> 00:05:22,050
And that's a great value to me and to this class. So that's fantastic.

55
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:26,639
Okay. Um, so I believe we stopped there.

56
00:05:26,640 --> 00:05:36,240
We didn't get any further away. Um, I have fun with the next few slides and this has been something which I've been adapting over the years,

57
00:05:37,650 --> 00:05:45,930
and I'd like to have a historical perspective on the beginning of this class, but tiebacks to definitions of meaning at the same time.

58
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:49,170
So the undertone here is going to be about the history,

59
00:05:49,590 --> 00:05:57,930
but I'm going to go back to the one beginning at the end of history to then definitions and then going back out to history again.

60
00:05:58,350 --> 00:06:04,050
And if there's something that you don't understand at any time, just please just recently had it in the sand.

61
00:06:04,390 --> 00:06:08,219
We never get that kind of thing. I know I'm British.

62
00:06:08,220 --> 00:06:11,310
I know I speak fast. I know I use odd words.

63
00:06:11,610 --> 00:06:15,000
Aluminum, aluminum, methanol, methyl or so on and so forth.

64
00:06:15,990 --> 00:06:19,559
I'm not at all upset or offended in any kind of way.

65
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:24,810
If you do understand what I'm saying or talking to you fast or use a word is kind of weird to you.

66
00:06:24,990 --> 00:06:34,350
Okay. Okay. So definitions and a brief history of microbial control and note I use the word control.

67
00:06:34,350 --> 00:06:37,379
Like I say, inactivation, anti microbes killing.

68
00:06:37,380 --> 00:06:45,150
I'm talking about control because whatever we want to do in this class, the key words, everything is control.

69
00:06:47,340 --> 00:06:52,440
So then if you know the band, the Temptations, well, what is it good for?

70
00:06:52,440 --> 00:07:08,759
Absolutely nothing. Well, actually, war is a terrible thing, but sometimes you some things that actually help in the future and a war in nation,

71
00:07:08,760 --> 00:07:13,200
a war and community often pushes technology to its limits.

72
00:07:14,970 --> 00:07:17,970
And that's why I think the a terrible thing that happens I could be wrong in all of this.

73
00:07:17,970 --> 00:07:19,830
But when you look at history,

74
00:07:19,830 --> 00:07:33,510
a lot of things that have been associated with that time period have resulted in new strategies or interventions for anti-microbial biocides,

75
00:07:33,510 --> 00:07:39,020
antibiotics, control mechanisms. And I want to go through some of the history of time.

76
00:07:39,300 --> 00:07:42,540
Okay. But I would say in agreement here, what is it good for?

77
00:07:42,540 --> 00:07:53,700
Absolutely nothing, apart from maybe something to do with this. So it's a history of stuff in control of microorganisms actually goes way back

78
00:07:54,090 --> 00:08:05,700
to about 46 B.C to about 119 eight A.D. where and this is by Lucius Plutarch.

79
00:08:06,300 --> 00:08:17,760
He was a Greek philosopher, noticed this the quote When weeds spews and filth stick upon the sides, the stroke of the ship is more obtuse and weak.

80
00:08:17,940 --> 00:08:28,350
And the water coming upon this clammy matter that's gotten biofilm cough got not so easily parts of it.

81
00:08:28,470 --> 00:08:41,400
And this is the reason why they usually call their ships by and it wasn't that long ago it is a biofilm that is microbes and stuck to a surface.

82
00:08:41,820 --> 00:08:48,660
And actually it turns out that this material is rich in bacteria, fungi, algae.

83
00:08:49,020 --> 00:08:52,469
And of course, what they're getting at here is it slows the ship down.

84
00:08:52,470 --> 00:08:56,460
Why was that can? Strange about that because they use their ships for war.

85
00:08:56,850 --> 00:09:01,530
I think the faster the ship, the quicker you get to places and avoid other ships.

86
00:09:02,250 --> 00:09:09,090
So that's where Asians and Phoenicians in the Mediterranean and Arena actually came up with a

87
00:09:09,090 --> 00:09:15,659
really catchy way to try and deal with this pitch and copper plated pitch to be like bitumen,

88
00:09:15,660 --> 00:09:21,000
tar coated aside the ships and the bacteria content here and now.

89
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,129
We couldn't hear the sea we could attach to that.

90
00:09:23,130 --> 00:09:32,940
The border was contextually that sea didn't have hardly any of this growth because pitch is anti-microbial, as is copper, but also pictures of native.

91
00:09:32,940 --> 00:09:37,260
It is just slowly over time shelves and so the microcosms can detach.

92
00:09:37,560 --> 00:09:44,760
So they came up with a really catchy way to actually have fat ships and kick the proverbial backside around the Mediterranean.

93
00:09:45,180 --> 00:09:49,649
Okay. Or based upon the control of microorganisms, they didn't know what microbes were then.

94
00:09:49,650 --> 00:09:59,790
They just knew that it made the ships go faster. Kind of cool what I saw the first known examples of microbial control, water purity.

95
00:09:59,810 --> 00:10:09,770
This is crazy. They used to say the Romans used to put silver coins into their water urns, and that kept that.

96
00:10:10,190 --> 00:10:13,700
And the reason they thought they were doing it was a blessing of Caesar.

97
00:10:13,700 --> 00:10:20,450
For example, Julius Caesar's headgear that lead a chopper in the water to bless the water and the water mains for a

98
00:10:20,450 --> 00:10:24,920
long time that you're traipsing across Europe and do all that battles and not worry about pure water.

99
00:10:25,700 --> 00:10:30,410
We now know that, of course, silver is an anti-microbial as well,

100
00:10:30,830 --> 00:10:38,390
and silver kept the microorganisms that would cause the water to lose quality over taste.

101
00:10:38,810 --> 00:10:42,800
Purity would go to increasing pathogens back down.

102
00:10:43,910 --> 00:10:51,469
Okay. So that was kind of a cool thing that again, they were doing it because they had to transport their water.

103
00:10:51,470 --> 00:10:57,020
Quite different regions washed much that truth parasite control.

104
00:10:57,380 --> 00:11:00,890
So what we don't do much on parasites in this case either.

105
00:11:01,880 --> 00:11:10,080
We don't do parasites per say. They were thinking more about sort of helmets and stuff like that.

106
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:20,750
It basically worms, things of that, but they certainly were using plant material in particular to try and prevent infections.

107
00:11:21,170 --> 00:11:30,020
Okay. Actually, I don't have it here, but a really good example actually during this time was where they use other things like honey as well.

108
00:11:30,620 --> 00:11:33,529
So don't you know much about the honey from New Zealand?

109
00:11:33,530 --> 00:11:43,750
If you read about this as an example of the regions and this honey actually is very anti-microbial but not messy for the reasons you will realize.

110
00:11:44,040 --> 00:11:52,490
And it's later when we do have chronic wounds, but we actually used to put honey on wounds and patch it all in and then actually prevent infections.

111
00:11:53,840 --> 00:11:57,140
M.A. Why does it is very rich in sugars.

112
00:11:57,950 --> 00:12:04,580
So sugars actually slow because high concentrations slow the growth of microorganisms.

113
00:12:05,300 --> 00:12:08,390
And also it has some natural antimicrobials.

114
00:12:08,430 --> 00:12:18,079
This actually can kill like organs as well. Somebody told me that then in a lab in 1900 and this is kind of cool.

115
00:12:18,080 --> 00:12:25,640
Like I actually divulged to the class last time that I collect old textbooks and academic books.

116
00:12:26,030 --> 00:12:31,970
I actually have some of the first individual textbooks that talk about the introduction of quaternary ammonium compounds.

117
00:12:32,570 --> 00:12:45,920
And I would argue that excluding penicillin containing ammonium compounds are the biggest discovery slash method of control for microorganisms,

118
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:53,180
and we are going to spend some time on that. In fact, the first quiz is going to be very likely on this tell emerging compounds.

119
00:12:53,540 --> 00:12:57,810
Where do you find it? And hit.

120
00:12:59,090 --> 00:13:00,409
In surgical scrubs.

121
00:13:00,410 --> 00:13:07,190
Surgeons, you could tell many compounds to scrub up beforehand to clean their hands, or at least not putting gloves on that kind of stuff.

122
00:13:07,520 --> 00:13:10,910
Actually, in Egypt, when they had to close down as well, you find it in toothpaste.

123
00:13:10,970 --> 00:13:13,970
Actually used to buy toothpaste. Now also mouthwashes.

124
00:13:14,840 --> 00:13:19,580
You find it in like so you find all the whole class of compounds with different forms.

125
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:27,590
And these were discovered through chemical synthesis in the early 1900s, and now they are in many products worldwide.

126
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:38,579
And what's really cool about them, emphasizes Matt Peacock chosen, is that even those have been used since 1956.

127
00:13:38,580 --> 00:13:44,990
This is not going to be some use. There's no documented example of resistance.

128
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:56,490
After piece of x. I'm smiling because I first arrived here back in 2002, and during my life in the first couple of years of the school actually said,

129
00:13:56,760 --> 00:13:59,820
oh, no, there's a resistance of mind in compounds now.

130
00:14:00,690 --> 00:14:10,110
Yes, but no. Yes. Bacteria can come slightly resistant to them, but not to the level of this use in products therapeutic levels.

131
00:14:10,680 --> 00:14:14,400
Okay. So they're really, really useful compounds.

132
00:14:15,090 --> 00:14:25,590
And I guess you further along the 1900s and the 1940s ending the theme of World War What is it good for penicillin came about antibiotics.

133
00:14:26,010 --> 00:14:36,089
Now, I don't really want to go so long into antibiotics in this class, but I do a little antibiotic into the feed now unless you all decide otherwise.

134
00:14:36,090 --> 00:14:39,780
Like I said, this this whole week is with a syllabus, kind of like all comes together in gels.

135
00:14:40,350 --> 00:14:43,830
If you would like to see more antibiotics, I can do that.

136
00:14:44,550 --> 00:14:49,080
I will tell you now. The other class I teach will have a whole section on antibiotics in it.

137
00:14:50,010 --> 00:14:53,400
I can dress as part of that over to this class if you are interested.

138
00:14:53,790 --> 00:15:04,650
However, I don't see a need for in this class overall this focus on non antibiotic anti-microbial and explain a bit further in a minute.

139
00:15:05,130 --> 00:15:09,960
Okay. Before I explain the terminology I'm using, let's talk about penicillin first.

140
00:15:10,350 --> 00:15:18,220
Okay. So penicillin was first discovered by Alexander Fleming and this is back in 1928.

141
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:26,309
We observe penicillin. Okay. Actually killing staph aureus was actually looking better than now is pretty cool because

142
00:15:26,310 --> 00:15:32,570
staph aureus has potential hasn't since expanded become MRSA water resistant staph aureus.

143
00:15:33,150 --> 00:15:42,300
We noticed that this fungal organism can actually kill Sartorius observations can be a pretty good academic umbrella.

144
00:15:43,320 --> 00:15:50,010
But then war broke out and people were looking on how to treat soldiers that were being shot in the field.

145
00:15:50,220 --> 00:15:57,629
And anyone who knows much about sort of treatment of individuals injuries or know

146
00:15:57,630 --> 00:16:02,130
that being shot is pretty horrendous thing and is prone to quite severe infections.

147
00:16:02,130 --> 00:16:09,420
In fact, more recently enough in the Iraq war, there's a new bacterium on the block called Acinetobacter Baumannii,

148
00:16:09,900 --> 00:16:18,240
which was actually originally called Iraqi vaccine because it was a problem because it's resistant to tens of antibiotics.

149
00:16:19,490 --> 00:16:26,010
Okay. So right back then, though, pre this, soldiers are getting injured.

150
00:16:26,040 --> 00:16:34,500
People were dying needlessly. And so people try to get a way to prevent infections, gunshot wound killings, the infection that work.

151
00:16:34,940 --> 00:16:40,339
And this is when Rockefeller Foundation then jumped upon the initial findings of Alexander Fleming and said,

152
00:16:40,340 --> 00:16:47,900
hang about, let's see if we can actually use this to treat prevent as soldiers died due to infections.

153
00:16:48,740 --> 00:16:55,070
So March 14, 1942, this is a staggering information.

154
00:16:55,310 --> 00:17:08,750
First patient 43 my first patient treatment streptococcal septicemia in us now only at that time enough ten patients by the end of the spring.

155
00:17:08,750 --> 00:17:15,350
So in one year, the spring of 1943, there was 231,000 doses.

156
00:17:16,680 --> 00:17:26,910
War is good for Syrian mobilization, the generation of a new antibiotic which saved countless lives during the war and countless lives afterwards.

157
00:17:27,990 --> 00:17:33,080
Okay. Um. Nice picture of tension there.

158
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:39,560
Any questions before you? So there's like a social construct there.

159
00:17:39,680 --> 00:17:45,110
This is representing the kind of style of the class. But how about that mechanistic construct as well?

160
00:17:45,830 --> 00:17:49,160
Well, so then from mechanistic standpoint, I'll take you through this.

161
00:17:49,330 --> 00:17:54,590
As anyone. 786 to experience some understanding of how penicillin works.

162
00:17:55,340 --> 00:18:00,550
Taking a class heard about and read about it now and go back and do it now.

163
00:18:00,560 --> 00:18:05,600
Yes, maybe. Let's take you further, Alex, to identify what we've seen.

164
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:15,739
And, you know, if we haven't had an extended growth so penicillin binding proteins, PB PBDEs are also a subject of transfer activity.

165
00:18:15,740 --> 00:18:22,879
So you actually called penicillin binding protein in UK contains activated facilitate cross-linking of peptidoglycan.

166
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:26,150
What's peptidoglycan what's what is doctor are talking about?

167
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:31,450
Well, in the case of gram negatives, for example, gram negative bacteria,

168
00:18:31,450 --> 00:18:40,910
you have announced a membrane in the membrane and there's these molecules that link together across these membranes for the PED has expense.

169
00:18:41,450 --> 00:18:52,580
And what you need to know is that is a protein that the bacteria produces change right here that causes these things to link together.

170
00:18:54,040 --> 00:19:01,540
Right. These molecules, peptidoglycan molecules, this protein, this penicillin, binding protein shapes.

171
00:19:02,020 --> 00:19:05,170
Actually, it makes it to bacteria and it helps crosslink.

172
00:19:05,770 --> 00:19:17,410
Think of it like hair gel. Essentially this molecule and enzymes protein creates like a gelling of the molecules making more rigid.

173
00:19:18,040 --> 00:19:25,300
Okay. And that allows the bacteria to be rigid out of the outer area.

174
00:19:25,900 --> 00:19:30,190
Gram positive side effect in peptidoglycan the outer cell wall.

175
00:19:30,220 --> 00:19:35,350
Gram negatives and more internalized here. And that gives rigidity.

176
00:19:35,920 --> 00:19:36,340
Okay.

177
00:19:37,330 --> 00:19:47,540
And the problem with that mechanism is that if you don't confirm what you do to the cell becomes susceptible and the membranes become very fluid,

178
00:19:47,810 --> 00:19:53,590
like a sea of membranes and peptidoglycan. And as a consequence of the cells can die.

179
00:19:53,680 --> 00:20:02,020
Now, how does penicillin work? Well, penicillin works by binding to this protein and prevent it from doing its job.

180
00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:05,330
So penicillin showed this, like, p like structure here,

181
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:15,580
catching and getting into the active sites and prevents the B molecule from actually doing its job.

182
00:20:16,150 --> 00:20:19,300
Okay. So it can prevent that from actually forming.

183
00:20:19,720 --> 00:20:26,720
Okay. It's distinctively a penicillin, binds to the PBDEs and prevent that crosslinking activity.

184
00:20:27,590 --> 00:20:34,819
You prevent that from happening. Then the cell walls and cell walls become less stable and the cells themselves

185
00:20:34,820 --> 00:20:39,200
become less stable and actually don't survive through one of the harsh conditions

186
00:20:39,680 --> 00:20:47,270
and grow very slowly and function don't like gram positive bacteria tend to

187
00:20:47,270 --> 00:20:51,350
have to patch up or not and always do have the peptidoglycan outside the cell.

188
00:20:51,820 --> 00:20:56,629
Okay, I'm going to draw this western minded one.

189
00:20:56,630 --> 00:21:04,130
I never really would you have done this, actually sent me this information and use a bacterium.

190
00:21:04,580 --> 00:21:10,920
Okay. Gram positive. In fact, I'd like them all out.

191
00:21:10,930 --> 00:21:14,229
You. So I think there's one maybe one gram.

192
00:21:14,230 --> 00:21:18,160
Negative. I actually have two membranes.

193
00:21:18,850 --> 00:21:26,620
The peptidoglycan inside between the two, but it's much thinner than that.

194
00:21:27,430 --> 00:21:35,649
Now, basically the gram positive bacteria have fixed cell walls and they and that's in

195
00:21:35,650 --> 00:21:40,600
here and they are very susceptible to spectacular glycans floating around like hair.

196
00:21:41,020 --> 00:21:47,170
Okay. The gram negatives generally are less susceptible because they're shielded by this extra membrane.

197
00:21:48,110 --> 00:21:57,690
Okay. As a consequence. Okay. Gram positives are more susceptible to dependance it is.

198
00:21:58,040 --> 00:22:03,770
The penicillin can easily get access and basically prevent this from becoming breached.

199
00:22:04,670 --> 00:22:12,290
Okay. And what's less well known, I think is a little nuance to the classic further is that actually, um,

200
00:22:13,370 --> 00:22:22,490
what's become the typical argument is that we can prevent this from happening in gram negative because it's shielded by an active membrane.

201
00:22:22,940 --> 00:22:30,560
They also have something called Lipopolysaccharide for gram negative force and that acts as an extra shield against penicillin.

202
00:22:31,280 --> 00:22:41,030
Okay. As a consequence, penicillin is the most effective against gram positive because the peptidoglycan is in the outside and in the gram negative,

203
00:22:41,270 --> 00:22:45,850
the peptidoglycan is shielded within. This is basically where you have your scaffold.

204
00:22:47,370 --> 00:22:56,220
I think that it scaffold right that you have scaffold in one kind of ground hoisted to have scaffolding on the outside in scaffolding on the inside.

205
00:22:56,580 --> 00:23:00,520
And that's really some protection. So it makes sense.

206
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:05,090
And that's how that antibiotic works. Now.

207
00:23:06,550 --> 00:23:15,590
And having an information, you know, match. Yeah. So. This is why I want to differentiate between antibiotics and biocides.

208
00:23:16,010 --> 00:23:20,360
We could spend weeks going through every single antibiotic.

209
00:23:20,780 --> 00:23:26,270
Me confusing the pants off. You basically saying well. This is the mechanism.

210
00:23:26,290 --> 00:23:29,460
This is the mechanism of vancomycin, Mr. Vacuum Mechanism, potential site.

211
00:23:29,610 --> 00:23:33,150
This is all these different kinds of things. Right? Why?

212
00:23:34,250 --> 00:23:40,040
Why do that? The key message here for antibiotics is they affect one target.

213
00:23:41,210 --> 00:23:46,350
One. It's like one shot out 90.

214
00:23:46,370 --> 00:23:49,729
Mike There was a distinction that a while have multiple shots.

215
00:23:49,730 --> 00:23:56,780
The effects, multiple things affect the DNA proteins, and I think membranes might affect constituents in the cytoplasm.

216
00:23:57,290 --> 00:24:04,730
And that's the bit I want you to get less talking about individual mechanisms, to talk about the breadth of activity and to provide some meaning.

217
00:24:06,830 --> 00:24:13,309
But that being said, that in more information, the greatest tranches of antibiotics and if you interested,

218
00:24:13,310 --> 00:24:16,580
is a Wikipedia link here and the common ones are listed here.

219
00:24:17,270 --> 00:24:24,350
Okay. If I would ask you to memorize all these, I would just ask you to.

220
00:24:25,260 --> 00:24:28,860
Okay. Who's pick your to pick? Actually, if I type, I'd say penicillins.

221
00:24:28,860 --> 00:24:32,640
The first one is the mechanism one. So packet penicillin is one of them.

222
00:24:33,390 --> 00:24:37,760
And I'll take you through that. But basically just know that there are different kinds of ones out there.

223
00:24:37,780 --> 00:24:42,090
Just know that penicillin and tetracycline, the two types of ones out there that are being used.

224
00:24:42,600 --> 00:24:50,730
Okay. So and so that necessarily available go as far as antibiotics apart from one extra point and that is was kind

225
00:24:50,820 --> 00:24:57,510
of cute about antibiotics though is you can mix those with other things to have an anti-microbial effect.

226
00:24:58,530 --> 00:25:09,749
So there's sulfonamides, for example. So so self-advocacy can actually be and we skip ahead a bit here gets me mixed with something else in this case

227
00:25:09,750 --> 00:25:18,750
silver to have an antimicrobial effects that are products that take a broad acting anti-microbial silver.

228
00:25:20,940 --> 00:25:30,059
Will antibiotics have a way to effect? And in the case of wounds, this is still this overdosing on some sort of mind antibiotic.

229
00:25:30,060 --> 00:25:31,470
And it's silver mixed together.

230
00:25:31,620 --> 00:25:43,530
And it has a really good effect on anti bacteria because you're attacking multiple targets on the bacteria, these two compounds.

231
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:53,520
Okay. So the self endorsing the full length block is that we that is basically this the sofa daisy

232
00:25:53,550 --> 00:26:00,870
affects metabolism and the silver has a whole host of growth effects damage it can bind to DNA,

233
00:26:00,870 --> 00:26:04,350
can bind approaches can change the confirmation of the lipids,

234
00:26:04,530 --> 00:26:12,150
the whole lot of okay you mix it together and we who then I will mention this later on

235
00:26:12,780 --> 00:26:18,239
silver belongs to a bit more but there's been a lot of cool work on with last few years.

236
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:19,920
It's a very expensive metal,

237
00:26:20,970 --> 00:26:29,700
but it actually has some really good anti-microbial effects and this instance is used for treating burn wounds and and so on and so forth.

238
00:26:30,300 --> 00:26:35,879
But resistance is can occur to silver, but it's weak resistance.

239
00:26:35,880 --> 00:26:44,070
So we'll get it further later on. And the main point really here is there's loads of antibiotics and they all have one typically one target.

240
00:26:44,430 --> 00:26:50,140
Okay. So it's pretty captured in the tablet.

241
00:26:51,090 --> 00:26:56,639
So from my results, okay. Um, I don't expect you to know this.

242
00:26:56,640 --> 00:27:00,750
Like I said before, just pick one and pick another 1 to 2 and hope to just go.

243
00:27:00,750 --> 00:27:06,540
Okay, that is penicillin symbol's penicillins.

244
00:27:06,750 --> 00:27:10,260
So we'll discuss that whenever you can actually use set.

245
00:27:10,260 --> 00:27:17,610
One of my example to say metabolism. That's all I can. I really are not going to be going too much detail in this class of magical objects.

246
00:27:19,420 --> 00:27:26,050
History I think is kind of relevant in that. And this is why we don't get stuck into the major things that.

247
00:27:27,120 --> 00:27:31,890
When you go to the literature, many of you are going into medicine, many of you into pharmacy.

248
00:27:32,940 --> 00:27:37,530
Some of you are going to be epidemiologists working in the hospital.

249
00:27:37,740 --> 00:27:40,860
What do we mean when we say anti-microbial?

250
00:27:42,150 --> 00:27:46,320
What do you mean we say antibiotic. What do we mean? We say biocides.

251
00:27:46,470 --> 00:27:50,940
What do you mean? We say static bacterial. Static, bactericidal.

252
00:27:51,690 --> 00:27:59,310
Okay. So I tried to list out here those definitions and try and give you some clarity because believe it or not,

253
00:28:00,150 --> 00:28:05,340
it is a nightmare that the literature and in fact, I just said that's the reason why this other meeting had to run down.

254
00:28:06,990 --> 00:28:11,309
It was a big discussion about what is acting like good and what is not anti-microbial.

255
00:28:11,310 --> 00:28:14,810
And if it's not anti-microbial, why is it not anti-microbial and what are the definitions?

256
00:28:15,090 --> 00:28:18,180
And even the federal government doesn't really know.

257
00:28:19,630 --> 00:28:25,900
You know, the federal government says when anti-microbial is. A compound that has three log count.

258
00:28:25,960 --> 00:28:30,340
In other words, you go down to 0.1% of the original population surviving.

259
00:28:31,240 --> 00:28:43,010
And that is why. I get 99.9% myself, 99.9% of it is because they have to do that to claim the evidence you might grab in the first place,

260
00:28:43,010 --> 00:28:48,980
because the government said the FDA says so. Right. So let's talk about some definitions here.

261
00:28:49,190 --> 00:28:59,870
Arguably, an anti-microbial is any substance, natural semi-synthetic or synthetic that inactivates kills.

262
00:29:01,040 --> 00:29:11,300
Basically what it means microsite or or inhibits micro static the growth of microbes because little or no host material damage.

263
00:29:12,010 --> 00:29:18,910
Okay. That's a broad is kind of definition that I found I kind of agree with.

264
00:29:19,580 --> 00:29:25,870
Okay. An antibiotic. By contrast, a substance that are produced by microorganisms.

265
00:29:27,420 --> 00:29:31,680
Okay. That can inactivate or prevent the growth of another microorganism.

266
00:29:33,170 --> 00:29:39,300
Okay. So really is one of it. I am alluding to something for another part of this class.

267
00:29:40,470 --> 00:29:48,330
It's really my crew. We're using microbial warfare, preexisting anti preexisting compounds that bacteria use to fight against each other.

268
00:29:49,230 --> 00:29:58,680
Kind of cool. The term antibiotic is commonly used to refer to almost any drug that attempts to edge your body of a bacterial infection.

269
00:29:59,250 --> 00:30:10,719
And that's where that day hazy starts creeping in. Because if you have a chronic wound and you put on an anti-microbial, you can stop arguing.

270
00:30:10,720 --> 00:30:16,740
Hang on. It's an antibiotic. Well, actually, no, because in this case, maybe the anti microbe is chemically synthesized.

271
00:30:17,590 --> 00:30:25,750
Okay. And it's not produced by naturally biofilms. And it has a broad number of targets when you get to the second.

272
00:30:26,860 --> 00:30:33,280
So I would argue that all antibiotics are antimicrobials and the broad classification in this class,

273
00:30:33,550 --> 00:30:42,400
when I talk predominantly from this lecture onwards, when I say antimicrobials and excluding antibiotics are my thought processes that make sense.

274
00:30:43,120 --> 00:30:46,720
You see, I'm trying to do introduce you to antibiotics and then say forget about antibiotics.

275
00:30:47,170 --> 00:30:54,930
This is focused on other things. Okay. Anti-Microbial has included antibodies works in three form compounds.

276
00:30:55,230 --> 00:30:58,410
The when is anti-microbial not an antibiotic.

277
00:30:58,950 --> 00:31:03,180
Okay, so this is what I it's a bit like Rubik's Cube to figure out what's going on here.

278
00:31:04,470 --> 00:31:09,230
And anti-microbial agents. That is not an antibiotic.

279
00:31:09,240 --> 00:31:12,070
There are some exceptions out there and we will come in the class.

280
00:31:12,080 --> 00:31:16,940
But in general they are fairly distinct and we can be we should think of them that way.

281
00:31:17,840 --> 00:31:23,240
And actually, my creativity can be derived from either synthetic, all natural sources and include all of the following,

282
00:31:23,600 --> 00:31:29,750
okay, antibiotics, antibacterial, antiviral, antifungals, anti-parasitic.

283
00:31:30,020 --> 00:31:33,390
The whole lot can still be referred to as anti-microbial.

284
00:31:34,070 --> 00:31:37,220
And actually, if you take it one step further, I didn't like in this one to confuse things.

285
00:31:37,460 --> 00:31:40,670
The EPA refers to the internal oftentimes as being pesticides.

286
00:31:41,420 --> 00:31:47,540
So it gets really confusing. But the point is actually, Mike, the main point I would make is these two bullet points up here.

287
00:31:48,410 --> 00:31:56,090
Okay. Now as talk about anti-microbial.

288
00:31:56,270 --> 00:32:01,169
Okay. These tend to be bacteria, static and activity stocks.

289
00:32:01,170 --> 00:32:04,200
The ocean from mine, but does not necessarily kill it.

290
00:32:05,040 --> 00:32:10,260
Okay. All antimicrobials are bacteria static at some oftentimes low concentrations.

291
00:32:11,250 --> 00:32:16,680
Okay. Some like there was a patches, they had all therapeutic concentrations or whatever used.

292
00:32:17,310 --> 00:32:23,610
So oftentimes many of the antibiotics, they will slow the growth but never kill.

293
00:32:24,760 --> 00:32:34,240
Okay. And some antimicrobials incapable of bactericidal activity, killing even in low concentrations.

294
00:32:35,350 --> 00:32:42,900
An example of that bleach. Bleach is one of the best things you can possibly throw in a surface to kill microorganisms.

295
00:32:43,400 --> 00:32:49,970
It's the proverbial nuclear bomb going from microorganisms below the surface to pieces, literally and figuratively here.

296
00:32:52,600 --> 00:32:56,770
Bactericidal activity in contrast kills bacteria multiply.

297
00:32:58,240 --> 00:33:03,880
So these tend to be a kind of concentration to side with antibiotics in making sure they are high enough.

298
00:33:04,180 --> 00:33:12,070
And that in itself is a problem because most bacteria that reside in your body that are causing infection or residing on a surface,

299
00:33:12,220 --> 00:33:18,230
keeping that activity grow. Some may be all that to be growing?

300
00:33:18,920 --> 00:33:23,540
No. So have you ever. I'm assuming all of you have taken antibiotics in this room, right?

301
00:33:24,230 --> 00:33:27,320
If you take an antibiotic, do you take it once you're done?

302
00:33:28,040 --> 00:33:39,769
You take it over weeks, right. So the reason behind that is you have in any given population of bacteria in your body, on a surface,

303
00:33:39,770 --> 00:33:47,420
some that actually growing, other ones that are slow growing, other ones actually are akin to being in a coma.

304
00:33:47,810 --> 00:33:50,870
They are fast asleep. In fact, they just persisted.

305
00:33:50,900 --> 00:34:00,520
Again, another thing we need to as well. And if you add an antibiotic, most antibiotics only effects actually burn.

306
00:34:00,860 --> 00:34:04,190
So, for example, penicillin.

307
00:34:05,670 --> 00:34:12,530
Right. It gives rigidity to the cells so that they can then have they can have confirmation, then be able to do.

308
00:34:12,550 --> 00:34:20,380
I would divide. You don't have that rigidity the whole thing moving around the center stressed and eventually die will eventually die.

309
00:34:21,460 --> 00:34:27,940
Okay. And that's where this whole point comes into play,

310
00:34:29,710 --> 00:34:36,520
and that is that you need to then have that exposure for a long period, and that's when the numbers start coming down.

311
00:34:37,660 --> 00:34:41,860
So I was dying, and that's where if your immune system is not particularly good,

312
00:34:41,860 --> 00:34:45,939
you keep on taking for like two weeks, three weeks, and you wouldn't have that infection.

313
00:34:45,940 --> 00:34:49,990
If your immune system is good, the numbers start coming down. The immune system can come in and take over.

314
00:34:50,860 --> 00:34:59,120
Okay. This almost always relates to multiply.

315
00:34:59,170 --> 00:35:04,020
If the bacteria are slow growing or inactive,

316
00:35:04,560 --> 00:35:09,330
then the oftentimes the it will not work because it's not affecting them because they're not metabolizing,

317
00:35:09,330 --> 00:35:17,190
they're not dividing, it's not making much of a stress. My analogy for this actually is a bit sort of morbid, but it's kind of true.

318
00:35:18,840 --> 00:35:22,100
You see in the movies, these action movies, Arnold Schwarzenegger movies,

319
00:35:22,380 --> 00:35:25,410
I think that I don't like action movies very anything, you know, some of The Lion King Man.

320
00:35:26,460 --> 00:35:30,600
But you see something get shot and they fall over. That's Hollywood, right?

321
00:35:31,050 --> 00:35:36,150
It's not like that real life. When you get shot, oftentimes you die under stress, right?

322
00:35:36,690 --> 00:35:39,930
Because you're like body goes in distress. You're psychologically in stress.

323
00:35:40,500 --> 00:35:43,590
Everything happens is the same, goes back to most living things.

324
00:35:43,800 --> 00:35:47,850
It's the stress that actually kills you if you are in a coma.

325
00:35:49,740 --> 00:35:53,220
You wouldn't know you got shot. Right. Same for bacteria.

326
00:35:53,250 --> 00:35:57,270
They didn't know that they got shot. They don't elicit all the same stress responses.

327
00:35:57,270 --> 00:36:00,390
And so they don't die. So I'm going with this.

328
00:36:01,050 --> 00:36:04,170
So that's where antibiotics are a big problem.

329
00:36:04,410 --> 00:36:08,820
They're targeting a particular aspect of growth or metabolism.

330
00:36:09,850 --> 00:36:13,580
Because the cell is shut down, it doesn't really matter because they're shut down.

331
00:36:13,600 --> 00:36:19,570
And so therefore, even if you're stopping cell division, for example, it doesn't matter if they're in a comatose say they are dividing.

332
00:36:20,680 --> 00:36:24,980
And then later on, they might wake up. You're like.

333
00:36:26,910 --> 00:36:30,360
And then start dividing all over again. That stays down to what it's going. Yeah.

334
00:36:30,660 --> 00:36:34,730
So I like spore form in bacteria. It's just really hard to do.

335
00:36:34,870 --> 00:36:39,090
You know, like, the spores are pretty much inactive, right?

336
00:36:39,510 --> 00:36:43,830
It's the same concept. Yeah. Actually, you know, to actually have these guys going out to tie in as well.

337
00:36:43,950 --> 00:36:50,939
Yeah, because we get hammered about, let's see, an agent assumes impossible to you know,

338
00:36:50,940 --> 00:36:56,850
we can't use we can't use like hand sanitizer and stuff, you know, in a patient with diarrhea and all that, you know.

339
00:36:58,020 --> 00:37:01,860
So, you know, that's the extreme form, actually.

340
00:37:02,760 --> 00:37:09,450
And we once they join this extreme form, that bacterium can do it from this form where nothing that we have is,

341
00:37:09,960 --> 00:37:15,900
even if it bounces off it, you know, pretty good either. And so how do you handle that?

342
00:37:16,440 --> 00:37:21,750
And actually you've connection segregated to looking towards the future in the class you handle it by accepting the

343
00:37:21,810 --> 00:37:28,950
that you can't handle it and put other things around it to them when it eventually wakes up to the computer message.

344
00:37:28,980 --> 00:37:34,560
And that's where we get with probiotics. You told me about probiotics and if that's the way it will eventually.

345
00:37:35,180 --> 00:37:40,230
Yeah. So that that's where we're going with this. I know these words right now.

346
00:37:40,650 --> 00:37:49,620
Maybe some this definition, I believe it's mind boggling. But as we go, as the class evolves, you get to understand we're talking about, um, okay.

347
00:37:50,460 --> 00:37:57,060
And of course, when you think about these bacteria that you're actually treating,

348
00:37:58,050 --> 00:38:02,790
forget for one second that could be different populations active, you know,

349
00:38:04,680 --> 00:38:16,710
active metabolism, easily stressed out, can easily die inactive spores, you know, that are not susceptible because they're just in a coma like state.

350
00:38:17,030 --> 00:38:21,450
Okay. But also just flip on its side for a second.

351
00:38:21,450 --> 00:38:25,200
You've got the bacteria, the biological, but it's probably the anti-microbial bit next.

352
00:38:25,620 --> 00:38:29,970
And that is how much anti-microbial do you at?

353
00:38:31,730 --> 00:38:37,880
So you can also make the argument that many antibiotics are good against microbes in the lab.

354
00:38:39,890 --> 00:38:44,750
Same goes for actually anti-microbial broadening the is the bleach and so on and so forth.

355
00:38:45,020 --> 00:38:53,050
The would you use that? And the therapeutic conditions, therapeutic meaning in the host on the host on the surface.

356
00:38:53,890 --> 00:38:57,070
And that's where you have some thinking about things.

357
00:38:57,580 --> 00:39:03,639
So the concentration of a given anti might be was really important.

358
00:39:03,640 --> 00:39:10,030
I put the mean there like as I said, I'm going to lose this is for example pretending to do that.

359
00:39:10,030 --> 00:39:14,860
All you need is the bow here. Okay. Concentration dependent is really important.

360
00:39:15,340 --> 00:39:19,450
Concentration and time dependent referred to as the contact time.

361
00:39:20,200 --> 00:39:28,140
That support. Okay.

362
00:39:28,830 --> 00:39:34,530
And of course, time dependent. So you bring me back in dosing every so often.

363
00:39:35,280 --> 00:39:39,390
She added It dissipates, added the disability addictiveness of AIDS and so on.

364
00:39:39,460 --> 00:39:44,550
And so as we did, antibiotics use dosing have every day to continue to be last and then what

365
00:39:44,550 --> 00:39:48,450
about the most points out of this this is a once in a coma avoid discuss that.

366
00:39:49,150 --> 00:39:58,420
Okay. So basically those factors that's it slowing themselves down from this cycle and the issues of back.

367
00:40:05,030 --> 00:40:10,430
So you know, Nancy, what's it like? Antimicrobials. So this is what we're focusing on, the class unlike.

368
00:40:13,390 --> 00:40:16,540
The antibiotics that have one target. Okay.

369
00:40:16,930 --> 00:40:19,630
The non antibiotic antimicrobials.

370
00:40:19,870 --> 00:40:27,180
Non antibiotic antimicrobials are first and foremost not produced by other microorganisms that chemically synthesized.

371
00:40:27,710 --> 00:40:36,720
They are they tend to target multiple sites, not just one, not just the member remembering the proteins.

372
00:40:37,120 --> 00:40:44,350
It could be cell wall, it can be metabolic certain enzymes, metabolic pathways, a whole host of things.

373
00:40:44,890 --> 00:40:48,880
Think of it essentially like a shotgun approach. Okay.

374
00:40:51,250 --> 00:40:55,329
As a were I mean, hesitant to use it uninvited, but my slaves are still thinking about it.

375
00:40:55,330 --> 00:41:06,470
And I'm going to say it will be really talking about in many instances of biocides that actually you're you.

376
00:41:06,610 --> 00:41:11,740
That's how you stop trying to break this down. You say, okay, we're not talking about antibiotics, we're talking about biocides.

377
00:41:11,930 --> 00:41:15,550
In the US. It gets a bit sketchy because this being something different over here,

378
00:41:15,910 --> 00:41:20,110
but really that's why I'm getting a non antibiotic anti-microbial sort of class is going

379
00:41:20,110 --> 00:41:24,550
to focus on and it's going to cool because they basically attack multiple targets.

380
00:41:25,300 --> 00:41:32,530
Okay, now that's for in chemicals, but this class goes beyond that except about probiotics.

381
00:41:32,530 --> 00:41:36,519
You start talking about viruses, we stop other things. Are those biocides?

382
00:41:36,520 --> 00:41:39,910
Not really. So you see, I'm going to this is why I'm hesitant to put it in here.

383
00:41:40,270 --> 00:41:46,209
So this is what I propose to you as a group. Okay, I'm going to use the word anti-microbial.

384
00:41:46,210 --> 00:41:53,830
You can use the word anti-microbial with the understanding that when we're discussing that in this group, we are excluding antibiotics.

385
00:41:54,760 --> 00:42:01,360
If we want to call out antibiotics as well in our discussion, we should say anti-microbial with antibiotics.

386
00:42:02,450 --> 00:42:06,690
So it makes sense. The reason why I did this in previous years,

387
00:42:06,720 --> 00:42:11,150
being so much confused by coming into the semester because people were trying to figure out what was going on.

388
00:42:11,150 --> 00:42:15,210
And I then I said, you know what? We can exclude antibiotics the best we can from now on.

389
00:42:15,230 --> 00:42:18,380
That's why I started promising to here. Does it make sense what I'm trying to do here?

390
00:42:19,760 --> 00:42:24,710
Okay, so shotgun approach often distinguished by being called biocides.

391
00:42:25,130 --> 00:42:27,950
And these are good because it's a shotgun approach.

392
00:42:27,980 --> 00:42:35,030
I know for a fact, if I was going to be heard, I would like to be in one place, certainly not in multiple places as a living organism.

393
00:42:35,600 --> 00:42:43,159
Okay. And what is going on right now in the in the field of people trying to create and

394
00:42:43,160 --> 00:42:49,520
create antibiotics is that there's resistance for no reason to become resistant.

395
00:42:50,740 --> 00:42:56,060
It's one shot, one target that's a lot easier to achieve if there's multiple targets.

396
00:42:56,100 --> 00:43:04,499
Do you agree with that? You know, if if this being affected antibiotic affected the so wall, that particular enzyme,

397
00:43:04,500 --> 00:43:08,340
all you need is one mutation potentially to make the enzyme different.

398
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:09,390
Okay.

399
00:43:09,990 --> 00:43:22,380
Um, now, if, uh, if it affects the whole, the DNA, extra number of the things you need more than one mutation to circumvent that and likely to happen.

400
00:43:23,040 --> 00:43:27,480
So makes sense. Okay. And bleach is arguably the best acid before it.

401
00:43:27,810 --> 00:43:37,490
Denatured everything, denatured proteins effects membranes can actually could also to within which issues of cytoplasm coagulation in the cells.

402
00:43:37,500 --> 00:43:41,219
It does not very good things. But here's the twist.

403
00:43:41,220 --> 00:43:44,220
So then just one last but two antibiotics are not.

404
00:43:44,790 --> 00:43:47,910
Would you choose to do something? I'm not going to say.

405
00:43:48,810 --> 00:43:53,210
Would you inject yourself with bleach? No.

406
00:43:53,420 --> 00:43:56,840
Right. I wouldn't. Would you want to drink bleach?

407
00:43:56,870 --> 00:44:00,290
No, I wouldn't. But would you take an antibiotic? Yes.

408
00:44:00,290 --> 00:44:04,000
Internally? Yes. And that's an advantage of antibiotics.

409
00:44:04,010 --> 00:44:07,730
But we're not going to go that way for much of this. This course is all about the around you.

410
00:44:08,300 --> 00:44:08,750
Okay.

411
00:44:09,260 --> 00:44:17,150
And bleach is the go to in many instances in the hospitals because it's so good and in the hood and in the left, my laptop, these buttons everywhere.

412
00:44:18,410 --> 00:44:25,340
Okay. But you could use it on the outside of your body for examination reach, for example.

413
00:44:25,340 --> 00:44:29,920
Closest thing at least is the chlorination of swimming pools. Right.

414
00:44:30,610 --> 00:44:37,680
So anyway. Most non antibiotic antimicrobials have this issue.

415
00:44:37,770 --> 00:44:40,960
You can't put that into the body. Okay.

416
00:44:41,670 --> 00:44:45,450
But it doesn't mean that they are less suitable, actually more Cipro in many situations.

417
00:44:45,960 --> 00:44:55,170
And that's because, as I said in the first class, I view non antibiotic antimicrobials as the first line of defense.

418
00:44:55,410 --> 00:45:00,930
You in the hospital, you want to be on a clean surface when you're having your appendix removed or you're

419
00:45:01,170 --> 00:45:06,660
having your arm reset off the rack or your knee implant that makes you do that.

420
00:45:07,260 --> 00:45:12,300
You're going to be in the middle of a field somewhere, right? So that's the first line.

421
00:45:12,330 --> 00:45:15,610
Second line. Oh, somebody's got food. You've got an infection.

422
00:45:15,630 --> 00:45:18,900
Then you take the antibiotics. Okay.

423
00:45:19,590 --> 00:45:24,990
And that's where I'm going. This angle, I'm trying to basically say the antibiotics in my place and personal.

424
00:45:25,230 --> 00:45:32,790
Let's focus more on that. Antibiotics are a small fix and a non antibiotic anti-microbial and the technologies associated with that.

425
00:45:34,340 --> 00:45:37,920
Sanjay? Okay.

426
00:45:38,190 --> 00:45:45,150
So with all of that in mind, let's start breaking down these kind of non antibiotic anti-microbial strategies and definitions.

427
00:45:45,660 --> 00:45:51,990
Okay. So the first really is a sterilizer also and a spoiler side.

428
00:45:52,350 --> 00:46:02,880
And these things, whether physical or chemical, are used to destroy or eliminate all everything, all forms of life.

429
00:46:03,330 --> 00:46:12,300
Okay. So these can be fungi, viruses, all forms of bacteria, and even see death in this spore like form.

430
00:46:13,200 --> 00:46:16,530
The most obvious physical agent you can use.

431
00:46:18,340 --> 00:46:22,080
It's not like. Okay. An autograph.

432
00:46:22,230 --> 00:46:31,680
If you haven't had a notice, essentially heats up a sample and kills that sample through high heat generated through steam.

433
00:46:33,270 --> 00:46:39,300
Okay. And sterilization is critical to infection control.

434
00:46:40,230 --> 00:46:46,350
This thing, if you go to a hospital now, if you even go into a dentist and they have an autopay,

435
00:46:46,350 --> 00:46:51,120
the things they are putting in your mouth or into your body. I would be concerned that.

436
00:46:51,120 --> 00:46:54,750
No, I'd walk out if I could. Okay.

437
00:46:55,140 --> 00:46:58,530
So this is like first line is the ultimate first line.

438
00:46:58,680 --> 00:47:02,970
Okay. Okay. It's widely used in hospitals and medical.

439
00:47:02,980 --> 00:47:10,370
Surgical instruments and equipment such as those lasers include steam under pressure, autoclave.

440
00:47:11,170 --> 00:47:16,930
So the pressure to at a higher temperatures. Okay, dry heat ovens.

441
00:47:17,680 --> 00:47:21,190
So dry heat ovens are not as hot, but it's dry.

442
00:47:21,400 --> 00:47:28,660
In Desert Case, not much can survive in this low temperature gas ethylene oxide.

443
00:47:29,200 --> 00:47:33,230
Ethylene oxide, I would tell you right now, is kind of like the WMD.

444
00:47:33,580 --> 00:47:38,680
It's actually a terrible compound. I think the med school has one machine.

445
00:47:38,680 --> 00:47:44,469
I think the dental school used to and got rid of it because of regulatory concerns,

446
00:47:44,470 --> 00:47:49,590
because these these gases are hot, experienced, which as we've done for weeks and weeks.

447
00:47:49,620 --> 00:47:53,020
So nasty. Really nasty chemical. Okay.

448
00:47:53,230 --> 00:47:55,870
And liquid chemical stabbings. Okay.

449
00:47:56,110 --> 00:48:05,110
These are solutions that are not quite as bad as ethylene oxide gas, but are incredibly aggressive at breaking down organic matter.

450
00:48:09,180 --> 00:48:15,350
Any questions? Okay.

451
00:48:17,150 --> 00:48:21,320
Disinfectants. So Sterilizers wipes everything out.

452
00:48:21,320 --> 00:48:25,820
Pretty nasty. Overall, you wouldn't want to be covering yourself in the sterilizer.

453
00:48:26,360 --> 00:48:31,670
Disinfectants, on the other hand, are typically used on hard inanimate surfaces,

454
00:48:31,820 --> 00:48:41,400
like to destroy or irreversibly inactivate infectious fungi and bacteria, but not necessarily the spores you see on game minutes.

455
00:48:42,350 --> 00:48:51,919
The most aggressive is the sterilizer. The next aggressive is the disinfectants, and the disinfectants generally destroy and use when irreversibly.

456
00:48:51,920 --> 00:49:03,730
Inactivate is a software saying how effectively? Fungi, other bacteria, but not spores was spores can be fungal spores and bacterial spores.

457
00:49:04,930 --> 00:49:09,490
Disinfection products are divided into two types hospital type disinfectants.

458
00:49:09,670 --> 00:49:15,430
These are critical to infection control and are assessed on used on same medical and dental instruments,

459
00:49:15,430 --> 00:49:19,450
floors, walls, bed linens, toilet seats and other surfaces.

460
00:49:20,590 --> 00:49:27,100
But then in Moscow General Hospital, such as domestic disinfectants and these can be used in households,

461
00:49:27,100 --> 00:49:31,480
swimming pools and water purifiers, says two grades, if you will.

462
00:49:35,790 --> 00:49:39,300
So this infections hospital generally is.

463
00:49:42,100 --> 00:49:52,540
I should mention sometimes they are species specific specificity with disinfectants, and this one relates to applications and claims.

464
00:49:53,050 --> 00:49:57,940
And are we talking more about this later on? We start thinking about patents and technology.

465
00:49:58,660 --> 00:50:02,110
Does it target one particular organism or homeowners?

466
00:50:02,110 --> 00:50:05,450
You. I think he's speaking sentimental.

467
00:50:05,960 --> 00:50:10,770
You said. Okay.

468
00:50:14,340 --> 00:50:17,450
Now what's below disinfectants sanitizers.

469
00:50:18,030 --> 00:50:25,090
Okay, so sanitizers are reduced, but not necessarily eliminate microorganisms from the inanimate environment.

470
00:50:25,110 --> 00:50:30,720
Two levels that are considered safe as determined by public health codes or regulations.

471
00:50:31,290 --> 00:50:37,290
So once we accept the argument that they will reduce the numbers down to below a certain level.

472
00:50:38,540 --> 00:50:44,540
Okay. Little household cleaners stands between disinfectants and sanitizer claims.

473
00:50:45,740 --> 00:50:51,710
Lysol. What does this say? Disinfecting wipes.

474
00:50:52,040 --> 00:50:56,270
There you go. Okay. So they actually caught the organisms.

475
00:50:56,300 --> 00:51:00,050
Yes, they do. Feel free to pass it around. So it's kind of cool.

476
00:51:01,120 --> 00:51:11,740
This one and illegal. We just said bacteria, viruses, animal viruses and then fungi and then albicans was an interesting open choice.

477
00:51:12,300 --> 00:51:17,800
Right. All right. So below that are these other things.

478
00:51:18,130 --> 00:51:22,330
Okay. And again, you can have seen the whole myself shown here.

479
00:51:23,380 --> 00:51:25,480
You can, depending on what would you use,

480
00:51:25,790 --> 00:51:32,650
depends upon the compounds being used in the anti-microbial concentration season that but is sanitizing once these are obviously disinfecting wipes.

481
00:51:33,940 --> 00:51:44,500
I had a problem. I didn't even know I had it. Okay. So there's kind of two categories of sanitizers, and these include food contact products.

482
00:51:44,680 --> 00:51:49,750
These products are important because they are used on sites where consumer food products are placed in stores,

483
00:51:50,200 --> 00:51:53,259
sanitizing rinses for services such as dishes,

484
00:51:53,260 --> 00:52:02,469
cooking utensils, equipment, things actually on farms, dairies, food processing, plant eating and drinking establishments they must have banned.

485
00:52:02,470 --> 00:52:11,350
That'll be in their code, either be state or federal. But hey, after you close every evening, you sanitize all the surfaces, you disinfect these ones,

486
00:52:11,350 --> 00:52:17,950
and you have different reagents, different products for those different things, do tests and nonfood contact products.

487
00:52:19,090 --> 00:52:22,120
So these can include things like carpets, sanitizers.

488
00:52:22,630 --> 00:52:25,930
I don't know how many of you in a house yet right now if you have doing that stuff,

489
00:52:25,930 --> 00:52:31,240
but you can buy these machines with these special solutions and you can actually clean the floors and sanitizing them,

490
00:52:31,450 --> 00:52:37,210
especially you got pets and things like that and it reduces the number of pathogenic bacteria in your carpet.

491
00:52:37,840 --> 00:52:45,280
Okay. And sanitizers sprays is actually becoming a thing these days.

492
00:52:45,280 --> 00:52:49,780
I have to admit my own personal thoughts on that. Not such a big deal.

493
00:52:51,820 --> 00:52:56,620
There have been more concerns of recent because of COVID and coughing and so on, said to be airborne.

494
00:52:57,640 --> 00:53:01,120
So it has the more attention laundry additives.

495
00:53:01,660 --> 00:53:04,700
That's an interesting one because we'll get that later. No.

496
00:53:04,700 --> 00:53:05,150
Besides,

497
00:53:05,160 --> 00:53:11,830
to mention this company before we we're going to come to that and talk about some of this kind of stuff later and intact toilet bowl sanitizers.

498
00:53:12,340 --> 00:53:18,850
So then if you've seen those ones that you can have a solid block, you can drop into your toilet tank behind.

499
00:53:19,000 --> 00:53:23,530
We have a device that plays underneath the bowl and flushes it, cleans the toilet that way.

500
00:53:23,860 --> 00:53:32,910
Sanitizes. Then you got antiseptics and germicidal and these are used to prevent infection and decay.

501
00:53:33,270 --> 00:53:41,730
Interesting words here. Infection and decay by inhibiting the growth of is not necessarily killing them, but generally don't kill them.

502
00:53:42,270 --> 00:53:46,110
And because these products are used in or on living humans or animals,

503
00:53:46,110 --> 00:53:53,190
they are considered drugs and thus approved and regulated by the Food and Drug Administration.

504
00:53:53,640 --> 00:53:58,860
So now you're getting the added close to antibiotics where things are put into the body.

505
00:54:00,270 --> 00:54:08,910
And it gets quite great. So can you think of an antiseptic or a genocide that you probably put into your body every day?

506
00:54:10,650 --> 00:54:17,400
Into your research report were subjective, like prescriptions or certain foods.

507
00:54:17,450 --> 00:54:23,580
Yeah. Yeah, that's a possibility. I was thinking a bit more obvious, even more obvious in that.

508
00:54:27,160 --> 00:54:33,060
You've all got white teeth today to face mouthwash, right?

509
00:54:34,170 --> 00:54:41,370
Those are antiseptics. And for even the ones that don't have the claim of being antiseptics, this gets even more interesting.

510
00:54:41,760 --> 00:54:46,830
They are often referred to as preservatives, which we honestly use to be the food you spot on.

511
00:54:47,160 --> 00:54:53,020
That's when you start getting into even more of a gray zone. So yeah.

512
00:54:53,700 --> 00:54:57,219
Um, so, yeah. And there are issues with this.

513
00:54:57,220 --> 00:55:01,150
I got some links down here. I had some problems opening capitalism recently, but I.

514
00:55:01,150 --> 00:55:04,810
Dettol is an antiseptic and a genocide, and I see this works.

515
00:55:05,940 --> 00:55:10,830
It works. There are concerns restocking this gray area.

516
00:55:11,820 --> 00:55:15,180
How well does it work and how do you compare?

517
00:55:15,810 --> 00:55:24,660
And so, for example, Dettol. If there's one thing in the US, definitely in the UK and again in many other countries in the world,

518
00:55:24,750 --> 00:55:28,620
you not in the US, it's a type of soap effectively.

519
00:55:29,580 --> 00:55:37,319
And essentially there's been a story came out a while ago that the concentration

520
00:55:37,320 --> 00:55:42,450
of the anti microbes in Dettol was varied and information to exchange.

521
00:55:42,450 --> 00:55:48,990
And so it no longer had the same anti-microbial effect and it always based on lab studies.

522
00:55:49,350 --> 00:55:55,920
So when you start getting into an area like that, it has this kind of effect which generally goes in depending on the concentration,

523
00:55:56,850 --> 00:56:03,750
it can get a little bit dicey, especially if you have changes in your formulation that you don't declare to the relevant agencies.

524
00:56:04,330 --> 00:56:09,210
Fact Companies perspective. Yeah. Okay. All right.

525
00:56:10,350 --> 00:56:14,069
And let's have a look at this one as well.

526
00:56:14,070 --> 00:56:19,230
This one works out. I knew this. So pages appearing, disappearing all the time.

527
00:56:19,890 --> 00:56:20,970
I shouldn't find that one again.

528
00:56:22,890 --> 00:56:30,060
They say there have been an issue with this, that when we change the formulation to change this trend, we have to go back to the process.

529
00:56:30,450 --> 00:56:34,200
And this is actually telling the FDA as well, how do you test those claims?

530
00:56:34,620 --> 00:56:41,529
So, for example, back in 2015 16, I attended a meeting of the FDA.

531
00:56:41,530 --> 00:56:45,870
You in attendance? This is in Washington, DC, just outside Washington, DC, Alexandra.

532
00:56:47,250 --> 00:56:57,480
And the FDA with the EPA, with their colored companies, academia and so many testings.

533
00:56:57,690 --> 00:57:05,220
So, for example, biofilms, how do we establish that to go back to in a bar film can be inactivated.

534
00:57:05,430 --> 00:57:09,410
There is no standard approach. Okay.

535
00:57:09,800 --> 00:57:14,660
So there's no standard approach. How can you test between labs?

536
00:57:14,960 --> 00:57:21,230
How can you test between, you know, between passed between between institutions?

537
00:57:22,350 --> 00:57:30,200
Um, and that becomes a huge problem. So once you start getting into these more, you know, it has an anti-microbial effect.

538
00:57:30,200 --> 00:57:34,580
But how, how effective is it? It starts getting a little bit funky.

539
00:57:38,850 --> 00:57:42,930
So we're considering chemical physical treatment strategies. These are not new.

540
00:57:43,180 --> 00:57:47,430
Most are old and neglected techniques. Now, going back into my history now.

541
00:57:47,490 --> 00:57:51,990
I wanted to do a little interlude of some definitions. Can you thinking about things?

542
00:57:51,990 --> 00:57:57,450
What is an antibiotic wasn't anti-microbial with that. How do we distinguish then terminology?

543
00:57:59,400 --> 00:58:09,570
And we start realizing that many of our technologies that we rely upon today actually still been around for a long time.

544
00:58:10,050 --> 00:58:17,490
So bleach chlorine, right. Has been around for a long time and it doesn't make it bad.

545
00:58:18,220 --> 00:58:21,240
Like Hugo, he was old, but it doesn't make him bad. Okay.

546
00:58:22,530 --> 00:58:27,050
These chlorine solutions, they've been around since the 1800s.

547
00:58:27,090 --> 00:58:36,780
In fact, Semmelweis used chlorine sprays in the surgical villages in the room spray around in the 1900s.

548
00:58:36,990 --> 00:58:42,420
And because of that, they actually prevented lots of infections of women that actually giving birth.

549
00:58:42,840 --> 00:58:46,440
So he was hailed the savior of mothers in Vienna General Hospital.

550
00:58:47,700 --> 00:58:50,980
And. Well, that's fantastic.

551
00:58:51,280 --> 00:58:55,989
So these older technologies have either then being considered old and replaced by others,

552
00:58:55,990 --> 00:59:01,360
or have gone through some kind of generational shift to be modified from clothing solution to bleach.

553
00:59:01,360 --> 00:59:04,540
Solution is different sodium hypochlorite.

554
00:59:05,120 --> 00:59:08,500
Okay. But it's changed over time.

555
00:59:08,800 --> 00:59:13,330
And as a consequence of that, some things have been forgotten.

556
00:59:13,330 --> 00:59:17,320
And then we remembered other things have still been forgotten and not gone back to again.

557
00:59:18,070 --> 00:59:24,730
So for example, with the bleach bit here that I stayed in, my memories was being defined as a technique.

558
00:59:25,360 --> 00:59:35,559
Okay. Other technologies have like disappeared, replaced by something and then gone loose and gone back to the old technology.

559
00:59:35,560 --> 00:59:44,760
Again, evolution is basically regressed. So, for example, ethanol, uh, system, that's a non-issue.

560
00:59:45,160 --> 00:59:51,520
I wasn't on last night. So hand sanitizer, ethanol, like 70% between 60 and 70% ethanol.

561
00:59:52,040 --> 00:59:57,460
Um, you go back about ten years ago, I can say because I'm not.

562
00:59:57,560 --> 01:00:05,770
The company was funded by the university in a previous institution to test out solutions of ethanol versus truckers and for hand sanitizers.

563
01:00:06,130 --> 01:00:09,250
Triclosan was coming in to replace ethanol. Okay.

564
01:00:09,280 --> 01:00:12,610
Ethanol has a really interesting effect themselves, Kels, and that makes them.

565
01:00:14,080 --> 01:00:20,140
But triclosan also has an effect. Now, I'm going to try, as I mentioned before, I say more who's had a triclosan in here?

566
01:00:20,790 --> 01:00:27,810
Anyway, one thing, if you're a company person, I remember hearing one time and a friend of mine,

567
01:00:27,820 --> 01:00:31,300
colleague of mine saying, if your company person is many years ago,

568
01:00:33,400 --> 01:00:38,400
the trick with triclosan is you basically encourage any you raise the price even

569
01:00:38,620 --> 01:00:41,710
worse because if you you effective and considered more effective than ethanol.

570
01:00:42,010 --> 01:00:49,330
The downside of triclosan was actually it's also associated potentially with endocrine disorders and cancer.

571
01:00:50,450 --> 01:00:58,820
Oops. So much set in 2019, a Ford health company removed from their toothpaste even in that story.

572
01:01:00,210 --> 01:01:03,400
Okay. So not only was it in Hand-sanitizer, but in toothpaste.

573
01:01:03,410 --> 01:01:09,020
And as a consequence, they can get their products. And now most hand sanitizers actually have ethanol.

574
01:01:09,860 --> 01:01:15,890
Maybe some have quit turning made in compounds, but the vast majority of ethanol designs no longer in there.

575
01:01:16,790 --> 01:01:19,280
And try and besan has been removed from many of the products.

576
01:01:21,100 --> 01:01:26,640
These are all contained or at some stage, I think many of these contained triggers that exist.

577
01:01:27,580 --> 01:01:31,870
Okay. And we're talking today to them, a class is such a huge problem.

578
01:01:31,870 --> 01:01:35,350
They actually even detected in the milk from mothers.

579
01:01:36,340 --> 01:01:42,850
It was staying in the bodies of individuals that long. So there was a lot of concern, some of those warnings in some wasn't.

580
01:01:43,540 --> 01:01:51,610
But either way, that resulted in a shift from back to the original compound that was used to do some of this.

581
01:01:51,760 --> 01:01:56,940
So what I said at the beginning, the class, I said things change over time, perspectives change.

582
01:01:56,950 --> 01:02:03,760
We'll be covering that. But to really understand this, we need to think about what's the history is and what our terminology is.

583
01:02:07,070 --> 01:02:12,350
Back to you again, judging by my age. Okay. Colter, can Colter go?

584
01:02:12,350 --> 01:02:20,120
I think Colter really? Well, Colter, which is stuff that was left to do in Kobani over the top, was actually a big problem in the U.K.

585
01:02:20,130 --> 01:02:23,540
I think it still is in many countries. China actually, Virginia, coalmining.

586
01:02:24,050 --> 01:02:30,350
But you can take this gun, give us line, and it's very, very anti-microbial and put it into products.

587
01:02:31,170 --> 01:02:35,390
Okay. Again, there are some concerns. Carcinogen.

588
01:02:35,570 --> 01:02:39,110
Yes, certain concentrations and depending how long you use it for.

589
01:02:39,920 --> 01:02:47,900
But going back to the early, early 1800s, Smith describes a Christian church used culture for use in wound dressings.

590
01:02:49,070 --> 01:02:52,640
Honey, I have seen before prevent infections and enhance healing.

591
01:02:53,300 --> 01:02:59,910
And it's still used today. PJ, you must have seen something like that in the shops.

592
01:03:00,210 --> 01:03:05,400
Anyone? Well, first challenge for you. They said you going to shop like the TGA is the pharmacy section.

593
01:03:05,660 --> 01:03:13,110
It's it basically is used to treat wounds and infections of a scalp because psoriasis, that kind of stuff.

594
01:03:14,040 --> 01:03:17,670
We had a call it was to have to take the pregnancy for it.

595
01:03:17,710 --> 01:03:22,560
Yeah. Yeah. So I think it's more outside the US, but I've seen it here in the US in fact.

596
01:03:23,980 --> 01:03:27,480
Um, actually, yeah, I've seen it and the shops.

597
01:03:27,480 --> 01:03:31,469
And so they're using those prevention as infections and enhance healing.

598
01:03:31,470 --> 01:03:35,500
You're not meant to use it all the time as a shampoos and medicated shampoo, I guess.

599
01:03:35,550 --> 01:03:39,050
I think it's sort of a medication improvement. Okay, I let us be here.

600
01:03:39,050 --> 01:03:43,740
Hair says vaginal formula. So it clearly hasn't changed much.

601
01:03:45,030 --> 01:03:53,280
So there you go. But also we start thinking about other products listing, use phenol in the form of hotel.

602
01:03:53,700 --> 01:03:58,080
So you've got phenyl out of it. Okay. And phenol, of course, is a carcinogen as well.

603
01:03:58,860 --> 01:04:06,030
But then it starts barely started using it in the 1860s for antiseptic surgery, but actually we're still using it today.

604
01:04:06,030 --> 01:04:14,580
No longer in surgery. Pretty much anything else. Good. Actually, we now have things that crawl septic sulfate medicines and that contains phenol.

605
01:04:14,610 --> 01:04:19,230
It's like a very solution that kids can guard. Really got like a boat infection.

606
01:04:19,590 --> 01:04:26,490
You don't swallow it and they spit it out and it's like a sore for solution you can actually get to to adults as well.

607
01:04:27,810 --> 01:04:32,700
And if you look amazing how I see it here at this female up here and we active ingredient

608
01:04:34,140 --> 01:04:39,060
service old compound that people have generally disregarded is still being used today.

609
01:04:42,330 --> 01:04:47,910
Hydrogen peroxide is used in wound dressing to treat soldiers by trigo.

610
01:04:48,300 --> 01:04:52,980
Okay. Back in 1893. But now we don't use it so much.

611
01:04:52,980 --> 01:04:57,990
A wound dressings. We still use it for surface to surface applications, cleaning surfaces,

612
01:04:58,230 --> 01:05:06,700
but also in mouthwash from OXO made by Colgate that actually has hydrogen peroxide and actually has claims on the

613
01:05:06,700 --> 01:05:13,350
fact that it enables cleansing of the surface by killing energy between bacteria and enhancing the environment.

614
01:05:13,380 --> 01:05:19,200
What is hydrogen peroxide do in doubles from contact? With what kind of material it makes things just dissipate out.

615
01:05:20,730 --> 01:05:27,500
Okay. And then we have concern emerging from Hans Jacobs in 1964 for fairness.

616
01:05:27,510 --> 01:05:30,740
I have been studying this through my textbooks and everything else.

617
01:05:30,750 --> 01:05:32,070
I wish I had this original paper.

618
01:05:33,270 --> 01:05:40,410
Some people say that this this paper is insinuating anti-microbial activity, and we say, no, just a chemical formulation paper.

619
01:05:41,130 --> 01:05:45,180
But either way, contamination compounds were discovered in 1916.

620
01:05:45,570 --> 01:05:50,580
And through the evolution and understanding of their use, we now have them today and things like Lysol.

621
01:05:50,970 --> 01:05:58,670
And what's really cool about returning ammonium compounds is because they're chemically synthesized, we can adapt them to kill certain microorganisms.

622
01:05:59,250 --> 01:06:07,130
It's really kind of cool to enter. And so Lysol actually has three different kinds of ammonium compounds.

623
01:06:08,070 --> 01:06:14,130
You see it here, Benzalkonium Cool. Actually referred to as the C 12, C 14, C 16.

624
01:06:14,160 --> 01:06:17,850
Don't worry about that right now. We'll cover that later on the really cool paper.

625
01:06:21,660 --> 01:06:30,930
Okay. What I sterilization would answer my sterilization more than the actual really aggressive, really aggressive treatments.

626
01:06:31,260 --> 01:06:37,500
Well, William Henry, he was in Manchester University, my stomping ground and my Ph.D. there,

627
01:06:37,920 --> 01:06:44,550
but not back in 1832 and 1932, used a type of pressure cooker to sterilize instruments and garments.

628
01:06:45,030 --> 01:06:49,889
So a pressure cooker, if, you know, realizing in autoclave it's the same thing.

629
01:06:49,890 --> 01:06:55,200
In fact, one of the first labs that I worked in, we didn't have enough to pay for what broke.

630
01:06:55,740 --> 01:06:59,430
And so what does my boss go out and do? He bought a pressure cooker and it worked fine.

631
01:07:00,120 --> 01:07:08,040
Just kind of we externalizing things in a thing we use in the kitchen ward found in 1887 that the blue light

632
01:07:08,040 --> 01:07:16,020
was more toxic to bacteria than and is a type of red light similar to how credit leaks out at any size.

633
01:07:16,710 --> 01:07:20,700
Red light. Blue light is more toxic than red lights.

634
01:07:22,390 --> 01:07:25,990
Why is that? So if you think about the visible spectrum.

635
01:07:26,620 --> 01:07:30,480
Okay. What's cool? You got blue going to bed, you have blue light.

636
01:07:30,490 --> 01:07:40,630
You can see that it goes to war. Green excuse to yellow just goes to bed and then followed by was the before blue.

637
01:07:43,750 --> 01:07:53,280
The Ultraviolet movie. Right. So that his version of Blue Light could be incorporated some of the movie in that to make sense.

638
01:07:53,580 --> 01:08:01,290
And that actually ties on to what's going on in more in the way he generated light which is using continuous arc coverage.

639
01:08:02,040 --> 01:08:07,859
So using electricity, you're seeing welders at the factories or in construction plants.

640
01:08:07,860 --> 01:08:13,470
They have a big visor on protect the eyes from what the UV light is being given off in a place like welding.

641
01:08:13,780 --> 01:08:21,989
Okay. We metrics see the same thing here. In fact, 1895 boats and x rays when we went beyond that using kind of technology.

642
01:08:21,990 --> 01:08:31,890
And then three years later, Ray, the x rays are damaging to bacteria and these are very low nanometer ranges.

643
01:08:35,930 --> 01:08:40,190
William fell into Snow White and then really up to now.

644
01:08:40,700 --> 01:08:46,790
What is happening now? Well, now we are starting to bring up new technologies.

645
01:08:46,910 --> 01:08:54,620
And I think, you know what you and I were discussing last time and you wrote in here, and I'm more I'm open to actually adding things to the syllabus.

646
01:08:55,190 --> 01:09:01,520
But certainly we have things like combinations of antimicrobials mixing, mixing technologies together,

647
01:09:01,790 --> 01:09:06,470
old technologies to try and come up with new ones, more effective ones.

648
01:09:07,080 --> 01:09:15,020
Also, there's things that nucleic acid hybrids, these are things that actually bind to DNA of specific organisms and target them, kill them.

649
01:09:15,650 --> 01:09:22,580
Cold plasma. Have coke and asthma. Or in funny cult as awesome as non thermal plasma.

650
01:09:23,600 --> 01:09:26,930
You see the movies like it maybe came out very recently.

651
01:09:27,080 --> 01:09:31,130
Maverick Top Gun. See, I like that movie, but what?

652
01:09:31,390 --> 01:09:39,620
What the jet engines gave out the fact that hot energy, like, is burning up oxygen can be the fuel to make them up to to give the plane propulsion.

653
01:09:40,070 --> 01:09:44,209
Right. So jet engine works well with cold plasma.

654
01:09:44,210 --> 01:09:48,470
You don't feed in oxygen, you feed in an inert gas.

655
01:09:48,850 --> 01:09:54,020
And as a consequence, the material you get out the back end is not hot and fast.

656
01:09:54,020 --> 01:09:59,910
You can actually pass it over your skin and it produces things that actually are anti-microbial free radicals

657
01:09:59,960 --> 01:10:07,370
that will get you on the road to add that essential oils back to the idea of old technology coming back again.

658
01:10:07,670 --> 01:10:11,030
Dark Ages, remember about medieval times using plant material?

659
01:10:11,360 --> 01:10:20,690
Well, actually, that's being refined. And we can now use essential oils that oils that are produced from plant material that's produced.

660
01:10:20,960 --> 01:10:26,360
And that actually has been shown to be really anti-microbial in many instances,

661
01:10:26,450 --> 01:10:30,830
many having very interesting effects and is certainly in many cases getting them.

662
01:10:31,160 --> 01:10:33,980
Sometimes they kill them, but actually confusing them.

663
01:10:34,640 --> 01:10:43,430
So certain molecules produced by plants actually can make bacteria so very confused they don't know how to behave in certain conditions.

664
01:10:44,270 --> 01:10:47,929
Okay. And other microbial divide compounds.

665
01:10:47,930 --> 01:10:51,709
So fungi can produce several compounds, actually.

666
01:10:51,710 --> 01:10:56,510
They can produce things that can target how microorganisms interact with each other.

667
01:10:57,560 --> 01:11:01,400
So some enzymes preventing quorum sensing.

668
01:11:01,400 --> 01:11:07,100
I'm starting to this one now. Um, and of course there's things that we've seen such as retardants kind of functions

669
01:11:07,100 --> 01:11:12,500
retardants but actually with slow the growth down to a certain level for other tasks.

670
01:11:13,820 --> 01:11:18,020
Okay. So there's a whole host of things here that are really came back to play.

671
01:11:18,410 --> 01:11:23,660
And as technological revolution is underway, it's resulting to new kinds of future technologies.

672
01:11:24,800 --> 01:11:31,160
So here's a question for you. And I have a lot not talking. Is that anything that really piques your interest?

673
01:11:31,160 --> 01:11:34,190
Again, this is always the first two lectures.

674
01:11:34,190 --> 01:11:41,360
Three lectures are being time for you, shouts out, Is there anything that you be really heard about you would like to me to talk about in this class?

675
01:11:46,250 --> 01:11:49,820
Against the hybrid sun just so we can sell. It took me about that.

676
01:11:50,240 --> 01:11:56,030
It's new technology is still keep them excited have been playing around with it but I can certainly develop into that.

677
01:11:56,500 --> 01:12:01,740
That sounds good. Anything else? Coach Passman, does that sound uninteresting to you?

678
01:12:02,940 --> 01:12:07,410
Yeah. Um, I was thinking I should be asking about David Garth.

679
01:12:07,730 --> 01:12:12,810
And things are passing electricity to things. Has anyone ever seen how you can actually.

680
01:12:13,740 --> 01:12:18,660
Interesting ways to sterilize meats using electricity. So we'll come on.

681
01:12:18,660 --> 01:12:23,780
That is what I mean. I think some of these newer technology food production can be kind of fun to to be boost up as well.

682
01:12:23,820 --> 01:12:28,440
So I like the idea of being suggested. Okay. I definitely want to have enzymes big time.

683
01:12:28,440 --> 01:12:36,509
I think they are some really exciting. Now I'm going to I want to put this out as a discussion.

684
01:12:36,510 --> 01:12:42,870
I will finalize this tonight. But I was thinking from next Tuesday or next Thursday,

685
01:12:42,900 --> 01:12:50,250
I didn't mind which I would like you all to go out and find something at home that's anti-microbial.

686
01:12:50,490 --> 01:12:55,470
So I'm gonna find an item that contains one or more antimicrobials within it.

687
01:12:55,770 --> 01:13:00,270
Right. Between 507 hundred, 100% conformal spacing.

688
01:13:00,390 --> 01:13:04,910
I found this product, I did research on Google, and it contains these things.

689
01:13:04,980 --> 01:13:08,580
It says antimicrobials, blah, blah, blah, has these compounds.

690
01:13:08,790 --> 01:13:10,550
This is what I found. Okay?

691
01:13:12,180 --> 01:13:19,830
And you actually read it and you basically have a little like I go back and saying, Google search, blah, blah, nothing to form a little bit of fun.

692
01:13:20,820 --> 01:13:23,220
Okay. To get you thinking that what you're actually.

693
01:13:24,840 --> 01:13:31,890
My old boss used to say we go home when you in the built environment, you are bathing yourself in anti-microbial.

694
01:13:33,060 --> 01:13:34,410
So I thought we have a bit of fun here.

695
01:13:34,550 --> 01:13:40,740
Okay, so we're going to find out what has got and then has little Google and say, okay, where is it normally found?

696
01:13:40,830 --> 01:13:46,500
You need this one product in other places, you don't need any mechanistic information.

697
01:13:46,890 --> 01:13:53,010
Okay. And try and be have fun with it. I'll tell you, a couple of years ago, I said it was some underpants.

698
01:13:54,090 --> 01:13:57,930
Everyone's laughing because actually you have anti-microbial underpants.

699
01:13:58,890 --> 01:14:02,970
You have anti-microbial socks. I'm not kidding you here that confuse a copper.

700
01:14:03,630 --> 01:14:09,900
Okay. You can have makeup. Maybe even quite surprisingly, anti-microbial was in your makeup.

701
01:14:10,200 --> 01:14:16,620
Thankfully, by way of anti-microbial, the terms I've told you about it can be a preservative.

702
01:14:17,010 --> 01:14:22,140
It can be, you know, listed as that are still the same thing as an anti might have stopped growth.

703
01:14:22,650 --> 01:14:33,430
Okay. I'm hoping that if you get stuck in a packet of mouthwash, toothpaste, whatever you want again.

704
01:14:34,140 --> 01:14:39,360
But if you want to be more interesting, if you're unsure, send me an email. This is meant for two reasons.

705
01:14:39,360 --> 01:14:43,530
One, if feel free to email me, ask me questions, get you to talk to me more.

706
01:14:44,040 --> 01:14:51,719
Come on, nice guy. I've said it before. I say it again. But also, when it comes to the class, we can discuss it next Tuesday to early.

707
01:14:51,720 --> 01:14:54,780
Would you prefer the first that we do first?

708
01:14:55,200 --> 01:14:58,920
I say, Hey guys, I'm to be moving. I'm quite happy to do some things.

709
01:14:59,070 --> 01:15:03,350
I would change your slides and make it to two Thursday and we will go from there.

710
01:15:03,360 --> 01:15:09,440
Okay. Any questions? This is 90 different.

711
01:15:09,450 --> 01:15:10,980
I'm excited to see what you guys find.

712
01:15:12,450 --> 01:15:19,920
I feel let me say something to crash whenever you feel free to bring the product in if you want to, or it's just this talk about it.

713
01:15:20,080 --> 01:15:27,790
Yeah. You know, like a canvas assignment for the part that I don't want to do that person is to bring the hard.

714
01:15:27,850 --> 01:15:31,830
So thank you. I thank you. I like to do hard copy, you know?

715
01:15:32,420 --> 01:15:38,590
Yeah. You know, I don't have a copy kind of person, so doing a copy in the hand of it.

716
01:15:39,180 --> 01:15:47,430
The reason I don't know the exact reason, I guess, is princetown bring it in on the beach.

717
01:15:49,620 --> 01:15:53,460
And of course, we can't bring the thing in or done. We've been the thing is perfectly fine by me.
