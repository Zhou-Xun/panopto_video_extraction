7
00:01:16,620 --> 00:01:23,850
Laura Power: um this class is a little bit different, I think, and probably some of the classes you've taken already through the summer session.

8
00:01:23,850 --> 00:01:26,820
Laura Power: This is the summer session in epidemiology and, of course, most of the.

9
00:01:26,820 --> 00:01:35,400
Laura Power: classes that are offered are very methods focused and analysis focused this class is a little bit different it's definitely more.

10
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:43,020
Laura Power: From those strategic thinking skills and leadership skills and it can be very general for more general public health.

11
00:01:43,020 --> 00:01:51,810
Laura Power: it's been built into this summer session and epidemiology just be recognizing the importance of you know, these sort of more leadership and.

12
00:01:51,810 --> 00:02:01,740
Laura Power: Sometimes, called the softer skills that come along and compliment these specific skills of epidemiology so so i'm that's how the class kind of ended up here.

13
00:02:01,740 --> 00:02:07,950
Laura Power: But i'm glad to be teaching this in the summer session and excited to kind of get to know all of you.

16
00:02:33,270 --> 00:02:44,880
Laura Power: kind of chat with each other and do introductions but we'll take just a little time to get to know each other, we do have a big class so we'll kind of go through and take some time to do introductions and course overview.

17
00:02:44,880 --> 00:02:50,160
Laura Power: And then you'll see i've got some lectures built in, and some kind of activities built in.

00:02:50,160 --> 00:03:03,270
Laura Power: For break time built in the well if things go according to plan, we will the last hour of class will really be allowing you to work on the assignment that will be for today so i've tried to build the class, so that you can.

19
00:03:03,270 --> 00:03:12,390
Laura Power: Get most of your work done during the time of the class, and you know you may have other assignments to work on, for your other classes and you can do that if you need to will try to kind of.

20
00:03:12,390 --> 00:03:24,630
Laura Power: build in the work during this class so we'll end up doing the self assessments that you can stay on zoom and do, or you can do on your own time, however, you want to so i'll give you more information about that.

21
00:03:24,630 --> 00:03:37,320
Laura Power: But what we'll start off with is doing introductions and i'm gonna i'll copy this and put it in the chat to you because i'm going to take these slides down in a SEC, to do all the introduction, but what we'll do is just go around i'll you know i'll start, will you can.

22
00:03:37,320 --> 00:03:48,870
Laura Power: Introduce your preferred name and kind of just your background where you're at where you're zooming from just a little bit about kind of how you got here and any leaders experience you might want to share or if if you're doing.

23
00:03:48,870 --> 00:04:02,040
Laura Power: And then, if you have a leadership role model why and why, like who's your leadership role model and why and it's Okay, sometimes people can't think of one that's Okay, maybe you'll think of some as you learn about leadership through this class.

24
00:04:02,040 --> 00:04:12,120
Laura Power: But that's what i'm going to ask all of you, and like I was saying, if you haven't already please, do you know get your video is on for for part of this.

25
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:23,430
Laura Power: I know it's really tough to have the videos on like a really long zoom session, but at least for like sometimes the interactive parts it's nice to have the videos on if you're doing some.

26
00:04:23,430 --> 00:04:37,860
Laura Power: You know breakouts will do that event, you know not today, but we will have some activity later so it's nice to put those on i'm just helps me get to know you better too so but I get it if you need to like eat or do whatever you gotta do so, I encourage that.

27
00:04:37,860 --> 00:04:47,550
Laura Power: Let me i'm going to just copy this and paste that chat so Do you remember what i'm going to ask.

28
00:04:47,550 --> 00:04:52,140
Laura Power: of you for the introductions and then.

29
00:04:52,140 --> 00:05:03,300
Laura Power: I will start though so welcome my name is Laura power and i'm a clinical assistant professor in our epidemiology department here at university of Michigan.

30
00:05:03,300 --> 00:05:21,300
Laura Power: My background before I came to public health i'm an infectious disease position and found my way to preventive medicine so i'm a preventive preventive medicine physician as well to have my trainees are here in class, and you know when so i'm glad to have them here.

31
00:05:21,300 --> 00:05:38,220
Laura Power: So I kind of found my way to public health, just through my work and infectious diseases guy real interested in public health ended up doing the preventive medicine residency program which we have here at our school of public health, and I did that from 2014 to 2016.

32
00:05:38,220 --> 00:05:54,060
Laura Power: In my role prior to coming to the school, public health and prior premiered I worked as a general infections do Dr Henry Ford health system, and I also was the medical director of infection prevention for our whole health system and.

33
00:05:54,060 --> 00:06:05,190
Laura Power: Definitely had some leadership experience is there something like i've been prepared for something that I was just thrown in and had to figure out on my own, which is often how a lot of times people come to leadership as maybe they're not.

34
00:06:05,190 --> 00:06:11,640
Laura Power: prepared for it, but they find themselves themselves in that position, and I think that's That was my early training after my.

35
00:06:11,640 --> 00:06:19,320
Laura Power: You know residency and fellowship kind of just jumped right in so it's been nice to kind of reflect on leadership, a little bit later in my career.

36
00:06:19,320 --> 00:06:26,250
Laura Power: So I came to prep my head and now i've been on as faculty since 2016.

37
00:06:26,250 --> 00:06:31,080
Laura Power: Originally, I was in a joint position between a hospital, so I think for For those of you MED students I.

38
00:06:31,080 --> 00:06:38,970
Laura Power: I had been part of Michigan medicine, I still have faculty there but i'm not seeing patients anymore, in the last certainly just over a year.

39
00:06:38,970 --> 00:06:49,350
Laura Power: I wasn't a split position now i'm fully dedicated to school, public health and some of our training programs and kind of connecting our students to practice.

40
00:06:49,350 --> 00:07:10,740
Laura Power: So i've taught this class a few times, so this is, I think this is the second time doing it online, so I feel like now we're also used to zoom and all of that so i'm excited to do this again with you and just to add my own leadership role model I can think of several different ones.

41
00:07:10,740 --> 00:07:23,820
Laura Power: I will say more recently, one of my colleagues named Angela back who's a professor school and I think you'll in and Annie some of you might know who Professor back is josh I think knows her too.

42
00:07:23,820 --> 00:07:28,740
Laura Power: She has yeah she was the Professor she's she's actually taking on a new job.

43
00:07:28,740 --> 00:07:41,640
Laura Power: But i've been watching her, and you know what has struck me about her, the reason I see her as a role model is that her strategic planning the way she can look ahead and use systems thinking to understand.

44
00:07:41,640 --> 00:07:53,460
Laura Power: what's going on around her, she was actually one of the main persons who helped our university to stand up their contact tracing so in the pandemic, as it was unfolding.

45
00:07:53,460 --> 00:08:05,100
Laura Power: And our university had to figure out its contact tracing plan she kind of took the lead on that and just you and us principles of systems thinking really which we'll talk about in this class.

46
00:08:05,100 --> 00:08:11,850
Laura Power: To help her figure that out so there's many reasons why she's one of my role models, but that's just one of them, so.

47
00:08:11,850 --> 00:08:19,710
Laura Power: that's my introduction and kind of a long one, but I figured you guys gonna be hearing me talk a lot, so I very give you like some background, as to why i'm here.

48
00:08:19,710 --> 00:08:35,160
Laura Power: I think what i'll do is i'll i'll kind of go around and my computer here and ask you to introduce yourself i'm going to start with josh he's our media assistant and josh once you go ahead and introduce yourself.

49
00:08:35,160 --> 00:08:40,140
Joshua Bosman: Thanks hi i'm josh Bosman preferred name josh.

50
00:08:40,140 --> 00:08:54,240
Joshua Bosman: I just graduated with my masters in public health from the University of Michigan and the general epidemiology department, so I have a decent amount of experience with a lot of the stuff we're going to be touching on I like to think.

51
00:08:54,240 --> 00:09:17,730
Joshua Bosman: I was the media assistant for episode 742 a couple weeks ago, so I don't think there's any overlap here and i'm recognize and he faces but i'm happy to be here again and yeah i'm here if you guys need anything media related or otherwise just let me know or let Dr power now.

52
00:09:17,730 --> 00:09:31,380
Joshua Bosman: I live in Ann arbor and i've been here I went to U of m for undergrad as well and I love the city so i've just been sticking around as much as I can, and traveling when there's not a pandemic going on.

53
00:09:31,380 --> 00:09:33,870
Joshua Bosman: and

54
00:09:33,870 --> 00:09:46,140
Joshua Bosman: Leadership experience is frankly limited at this juncture, having just gotten out of school I don't have a ton of real world experience, I will say I have been.

55
00:09:46,140 --> 00:09:52,530
Joshua Bosman: Working the entertainment sector of some of the local bars i've been in charge of hosting trivia.

56
00:09:52,530 --> 00:10:13,470
Joshua Bosman: And i've had to hire some people out for that and try to you know, make it function in conjunction with a lot of the other things going on simultaneously and coordinate with various REPS to to get a funding and whatnot for that so it's been fun.

57
00:10:13,470 --> 00:10:20,310
Joshua Bosman: and good good experience my leadership role model would be Dr Anthony foushee.

58
00:10:20,310 --> 00:10:27,780
Joshua Bosman: i've been very impressed with his rhetoric and demeanor and the way he carries himself throughout the pandemic.

59
00:10:27,780 --> 00:10:42,420
Joshua Bosman: recently found out he's 80 years old, which was surprising he he's very spry and he's always getting up there in the face of a lot of contentiousness and a lot of.

60
00:10:42,420 --> 00:10:55,530
Joshua Bosman: Like vitriol from the American public and he gets up there, regardless, and he tells it like it is without without using like fear mongering tactics.

61
00:10:55,530 --> 00:11:09,360
Joshua Bosman: So I just really respect the way that he tries to play ball with with everyone that again and his goal truly seems to be educating the public, and I would like to emulate that throughout my career.

62
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:11,820
Laura Power: I think stash that's a great example to.

63
00:11:11,820 --> 00:11:19,050
Laura Power: I think, as we go through a day will be talking about leadership traits and things and that one just really struck me what always stands out about Dr.

64
00:11:19,050 --> 00:11:25,320
Laura Power: g's you know so much energy that's gotta be something that a leader has is just like an ending energy.

65
00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:34,110
Laura Power: And I really think I didn't say I didn't answer all of my own questions i'm asking you to answer so you all can call me Laura so i'll just say that preferred name, please call me Laura.

66
00:11:34,110 --> 00:11:41,550
Laura Power: I gave you my long background I am coming i'm doing from near Brighton i'm just a little bit north of Ann arbor.

67
00:11:41,550 --> 00:11:50,940
Laura Power: I was going to do for my office my work computer with haven't been using a while, is a little bit shaky so I feel confident to me from here than there.

68
00:11:50,940 --> 00:12:04,350
Laura Power: And I told you, the rest of it, so I wanted to make sure you can call me Laura alright, so you only in your next on my computer screen.

69
00:12:04,350 --> 00:12:20,670
Yolaine A Civil: hi my name is Anna Ulan Seville, I am from Detroit but I did my training and worked at Michigan medicine for a long time so i've been in the in our area actually live in ypsilanti.

70
00:12:20,670 --> 00:12:34,320
Yolaine A Civil: password things i've had a lot of past work experience, but in terms of leadership roles only had a few of those, the main one, I would see was when I was with doctors without borders.

71
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:53,880
Yolaine A Civil: For the two year period, I was the medical team leader and I did not find out, I was going to be medical team leader until I got overseas, I was in Germany and the person that begged me to do it ended up having a stroke, so I had no backup and I was the team leader once I got to.

72
00:12:53,880 --> 00:13:07,890
Yolaine A Civil: The country the West Africa, and I have to say it was hard and uh but I learned a lot and so after that they kept putting me in leadership roles after that mission.

73
00:13:07,890 --> 00:13:17,460
Yolaine A Civil: So my leadership role models and I had a friend on that Michigan who is actually.

74
00:13:17,460 --> 00:13:38,910
Yolaine A Civil: They cut the name, for it is a French name sponsor but basically she was the equivalent of the person who was in charge of all the medical activities in the country so she was a physician Ethiopian physician she's incredible she taught me a lot of things i'm a pediatrician but she.

75
00:13:38,910 --> 00:13:47,880
Yolaine A Civil: taught me like I had to be in charge of Ob gyn and internal medicine also so she helped me sort of learn how to navigate that in Africa.

76
00:13:47,880 --> 00:13:59,970
Yolaine A Civil: So she's one, and then I have a few mentors who are pediatricians also from Michigan medicine, who also have mentoring me Oh, and I forgot to say i'm a second year preventive medicine.

77
00:13:59,970 --> 00:14:05,700
Laura Power: So that's why I know Colin so well, and one of the.

78
00:14:05,700 --> 00:14:09,390
Laura Power: Great Thank you i'm glad you're here.

79
00:14:09,390 --> 00:14:11,430
Laura Power: Alright next we'll go to Laura.

80
00:14:11,430 --> 00:14:14,340

81
00:14:14,340 --> 00:14:21,180
Laura Grage: tie yeah it's my preferred name is Laura last name is groggy.

82
00:14:21,180 --> 00:14:34,680
Laura Grage: I live and i'm zooming from fairbanks Alaska so it's much earlier in the day for me, but fortunately not as early as the morning sessions are so i'll be a little more woke up for this session.

83
00:14:34,680 --> 00:14:39,930
Laura Grage: Excuse me i'm just getting over the really strange summer cold.

84
00:14:39,930 --> 00:14:47,970
Laura Grage: My past work experience i'm a registered nurse, and I have been slowly migrating from the bedside to public health.

85
00:14:47,970 --> 00:15:04,560
Laura Grage: And once I was in public health realized, I really liked epidemiology and I liked biostatistics hence i've been participating in this program and trying to add a few more methods to my electives for my mph.

86
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:15,900
Laura Grage: But I also just realized this week that I think we've all been seeing just how important leadership is and that that softer skill that Laura was mentioning in her introduction.

87
00:15:15,900 --> 00:15:26,400
Laura Grage: is just really important my leadership experience is limited and pretty informal just kind of when it happens on the spot, so no official leadership roles.

88
00:15:26,400 --> 00:15:39,660
Laura Grage: And my leadership mentor would be Professor here at university of Alaska named Tom Hennessy and I really like his style of leadership, because he the way that he relates to people.

89
00:15:39,660 --> 00:15:59,190
Laura Grage: is really calm and clear and transparent and fair, and he is really able to articulate himself well and thus be pretty influential and has been for the last year and a half now with the COPA pandemic in Alaska and I think I hit all the highlights Thank you yeah.

90
00:15:59,190 --> 00:16:00,390
Laura Power: Thank you welcome we're glad.

91
00:16:00,390 --> 00:16:02,130
Laura Grage: To be here.

92
00:16:02,130 --> 00:16:06,780
Laura Power: Next up is Anthony Mackie.

93
00:16:06,780 --> 00:16:15,630
Anthony Mack: Everybody my name is Anthony my preferred name is Anthony and I am living in zooming from Ann arbor.

94
00:16:15,630 --> 00:16:21,390
Anthony Mack: i've been here oh for size for years now.

95
00:16:21,390 --> 00:16:36,900
Anthony Mack: Doing my farm D, as well as a master of science and clinical research is currently my last week in the master's program before going back in finishing my fourth year of my farm D.

96
00:16:36,900 --> 00:16:45,870
Anthony Mack: My past and current work experiences have been for my primarily in a combination of wet and dry labs.

97
00:16:45,870 --> 00:16:51,330
Anthony Mack: Working a little bit in neuro chemistry to start off with but labs.

98
00:16:51,330 --> 00:17:00,900
Anthony Mack: And then transitioning into cardiovascular research, I was also an intern and Michigan medicine in their pharmacy department for two years.

99
00:17:00,900 --> 00:17:05,130
Anthony Mack: Before taking this year off to do my masters.

100
00:17:05,130 --> 00:17:18,060
Anthony Mack: Leadership experience i've been on a few boards serving as a liaison between our student body and our faculty for the pharmacy school.

101
00:17:18,060 --> 00:17:25,980
Anthony Mack: I was also elected system board with some organizations treasury Vice President.

102
00:17:25,980 --> 00:17:31,740
Anthony Mack: So getting to get involved that way was a great learning experience.

103
00:17:31,740 --> 00:17:46,860
Anthony Mack: And then my leadership role model actually kind of a hybrid between my two parents, they have very different strategies in terms of being leaders, and I think a hybrid model of both of them actually would work better than one way or the other.

104
00:17:46,860 --> 00:17:49,860
Anthony Mack: I father is a little bit more.

105
00:17:49,860 --> 00:17:56,130
Anthony Mack: I wouldn't say commands respect, but he definitely is a respectable person.

106
00:17:56,130 --> 00:18:08,670
Anthony Mack: Both giving and receiving and my mom takes more empathetic approach, so I think being able to combine those two would definitely be my my leadership model.

107
00:18:08,670 --> 00:18:11,160

Kate Schedel (she/her/hers): hey everyone i'm Kate shade all.

113
00:18:21,630 --> 00:18:28,410
Kate Schedel (she/her/hers): I am in indianapolis indiana i'm joining from the indiana Department of Health or state health department.

114
00:18:28,410 --> 00:18:43,950
Kate Schedel (she/her/hers): I am the maternal and child health programs director, which means anything from birth through parenthood plus caregivers and sort of our population adolescence included in there, which are often forgotten.

115
00:18:43,950 --> 00:18:52,740
Kate Schedel (she/her/hers): We don't know, I guess, I would say i've been in a ton of different roles, I came to the State after maybe 12 years of experience working in global health.

116
00:18:52,740 --> 00:19:00,060
Kate Schedel (she/her/hers): And so it's a different experience for me i've had a ton of different jobs and a lot of different places and.

117
00:19:00,060 --> 00:19:18,210
Kate Schedel (she/her/hers): Really lacked leadership and public health, the guidance and good supervisors and good support systems, and so I feel like it's on me to sort of take take my own education into my own hands and try and do better and be a better leader.

118
00:19:18,210 --> 00:19:24,180
Kate Schedel (she/her/hers): Sarah you can tell me later if i'm doing a good job of that she's on my team and.

120
00:19:32,130 --> 00:19:43,350
Kate Schedel (she/her/hers): I would say my leadership role model is Kim was Scott, who wrote radical candor and I just really like the concept of being really truthful and honest with your team.

121
00:19:43,350 --> 00:19:47,880
Kate Schedel (she/her/hers): and your responsibilities and everything you're working on so.

124
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:08,400
Laura Power: Alright Next, I think.

125
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:11,280
Laura Power: i'm on my screen your next.

126
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:24,990
Anam: hi everyone, my name is on him and I am a PhD candidate in the epidemiology department so i'm really excited to take this course to supplement a lot of the methods training that i've kind of received.

127
00:20:24,990 --> 00:20:37,710
Anam: Over the course of my degree and in terms of where i'm from so obviously i'm usually in October, but i'm actually home in Toronto, right now, so that's friends zooming in from.

128
00:20:37,710 --> 00:20:45,390
Anam: Before I started my PhD at the Michigan School of Public Health I worked as an epidemiologist in.

129
00:20:45,390 --> 00:20:55,530
Anam: A applied research Center they did a lot of health policy work using claims data here in Toronto, Canada and i've also done some work.

130
00:20:55,530 --> 00:21:02,850
Anam: At cancer research institutions been involved in some cardiovascular research projects as well, and some occupational health work.

131
00:21:02,850 --> 00:21:09,600
Anam: And I think, from a leadership experience perspective i've had the opportunity to serve on a lot of executive.

132
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:19,590
Anam: boards and in some positions both like within the department in student organizations and in some of the extracurricular activities that i've been involved in.

133
00:21:19,590 --> 00:21:30,510
Anam: And there's a few people I would look up to in terms of leadership role models, but I think one of the things that they all have in common is their ability to really.

134
00:21:30,510 --> 00:21:36,570
Anam: understand and leverage the expertise that people on their team bring to the table, and then to also.

135
00:21:36,570 --> 00:21:47,760
Anam: bring out the best in their team so to recognize where people want to go and really leverage that and I have benefited from being on teams with those individuals and it's really helped me grow.

136
00:21:47,760 --> 00:22:00,660
Anam: As a person as an academic as well, so that's one of the things that I try and bring to any team experience, whether i'm just a member, or if i'm in a leadership role.

137
00:22:00,660 --> 00:22:02,970
Laura Power: Thanks for those comments and.

138
00:22:02,970 --> 00:22:12,960
Laura Power: All the things you're all saying I feel like these ideas come out or I hope that they come out so even as you were saying like whether you're in an actual years of role or a member on a team, all of these things.

139
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:21,510
Laura Power: really do apply formal leadership versus just leadership skills that we may all have who are you working with I for your PhD.

140
00:22:21,510 --> 00:22:23,640

154
00:23:47,910 --> 00:23:56,970
Ahya Sajawal Ali: Getting all the information together and sort of simulating that to make health policy decisions and recommendations.

00:24:53,670 --> 00:24:59,190
Ahya Sajawal Ali: Natural she is about her own life, I feel like I really, really admire that.

162
00:24:59,190 --> 00:25:10,980
Ahya Sajawal Ali: And if more people are able to be compassionate and be themselves in leadership roles, I feel like that would really bring about a really good change in the world how.

163
00:25:10,980 --> 00:25:26,640

182
00:27:38,040 --> 00:27:56,790
Aliyah Abdul-Wakil: A few months ago, so I was really excited to see this course, and to really build up on my leadership skills and take some things away that I can bring back to my team and just kind of also help them grow and advocate for them.

183
00:27:56,790 --> 00:27:59,460

188
00:28:34,800 --> 00:28:46,020
Aliyah Abdul-Wakil: And she was just an amazing person that was able to coordinate of capacity, like across agencies, because we were in this.

Aliyah Abdul-Wakil: We were in this like multi agency space.

190
00:28:50,490 --> 00:29:01,230
Aliyah Abdul-Wakil: Working with different agencies that had different needs and different things that they were interested in, but I was just really impressed with how she was able to bring us all together.

191
00:29:01,230 --> 00:29:16,200
Aliyah Abdul-Wakil: In a way, that was cohesive and really was able to create the sense of a team across agencies, which I think is really difficult, especially when you have competing priorities and competing interests, but I think she did an amazing job.

192
00:29:16,200 --> 00:29:22,710
Aliyah Abdul-Wakil: With that and she's just somebody that i'll just always look up to and I try to.

201
00:30:10,710 --> 00:30:17,340
Sarah E Briley: So I have been at the state health department for five years, my first job with the health department was.

Sarah E Briley: With very similar team structures that was really great experience I learned load up myself through that and more about my own leadership style, I would say my leadership role model was actually my mom.

207
00:31:15,060 --> 00:31:27,810
Sarah E Briley: She did not have a lot of time between giving birth to me then going back to work, so I basically grew up in her facility, she was a nursing home administrator so I grew up with her population and.

208
00:31:27,810 --> 00:31:34,260
Sarah E Briley: I got to really see her day to day basically until I went to elementary school and then so on the weekends, when she would go in.

209
00:31:34,260 --> 00:31:46,200
Sarah E Briley: To fellowship so I got to see her dedication to those patients and making sure that facility felt like a true home to them, so I would say my mom we're going to have you here, Sarah.

00:33:47,220 --> 00:33:52,620
Erin Thompson: I don't really have a leadership role model, but one.

225
00:33:52,620 --> 00:34:05,340
Erin Thompson: good example the Leader just in my time at DHS was my previous supervisor audrey young she's over children special health care needs and she.

226
00:34:05,340 --> 00:34:09,360
Erin Thompson: I think it's just a really good example of a leader and a manager.

227
00:34:09,360 --> 00:34:22,020
Erin Thompson: In the leadership program they went through or I went through it DHS they really emphasize like a leader isn't necessarily a manager and vice versa, but I think she is like really good example both she.

228
00:34:22,020 --> 00:34:27,990
Erin Thompson: encouraged me to apply the leadership program and.

229
00:34:27,990 --> 00:34:38,280
Erin Thompson: Like she's not my supervisor now, but when I was with that team, like, I felt like it was really a team, and we had like team meetings and.

230
00:34:38,280 --> 00:34:43,470
Erin Thompson: I feel like she's like really supportive and I could talk to her about like personal things too.

231
00:34:43,470 --> 00:34:46,080
Erin Thompson: So that's one example.

232
00:34:46,080 --> 00:35:00,120
Laura Power: that's great so you could see those quality so welcome yeah so maternal child health is very strong middle class so we'll see i'm going to water lots of examples to think of it as we you know reflect on things in the class so welcome Aaron.

233
00:35:00,120 --> 00:35:00,930
Laura Power: Next up.

235
00:35:07,050 --> 00:35:20,580
Anne Victoria Lee: Oh Emily and i'm Jamie from Ann arbor where I lived for now one year i'm originally from the West Coast from California and Oregon and.

236
00:35:20,580 --> 00:35:24,360
Anne Victoria Lee: In terms of leadership experience.

237
00:35:24,360 --> 00:35:28,230
Anne Victoria Lee: I never really thought of myself as having.

238
00:35:28,230 --> 00:35:38,190
Anne Victoria Lee: A title of a leadership role that I realized well in my work in San Francisco I was the medical, legal director of.

239
00:35:38,190 --> 00:35:49,080
Anne Victoria Lee: The law firm that I worked for for over six years and I oversaw and managed a lot of catastrophic injury cases.

240
00:35:49,080 --> 00:35:53,340
Anne Victoria Lee: Some diet drug litigation cases and.

241
00:35:53,340 --> 00:35:56,430
Anne Victoria Lee: I interacted directly with.

242
00:35:56,430 --> 00:36:08,610
Anne Victoria Lee: The claims adjusters as well as treating positions, as well as the attorneys managing cases and also the client to I treated like patients.

243
00:36:08,610 --> 00:36:18,060
Anne Victoria Lee: So that was one role I also volunteered as with the junior league of San Francisco in one year I was on a committee that.

244
00:36:18,060 --> 00:36:25,860
Anne Victoria Lee: did a lot of fundraising and i'm is the Co Chair of our small movies, and even though there were only five of us.

245
00:36:25,860 --> 00:36:44,460
Anne Victoria Lee: All five of us within that one year we raised over $90,000 and that was actually one third of the total budget of the income that we earn the total events and so that was actually really exciting and there's a lot of work.

246
00:36:44,460 --> 00:36:49,950
Anne Victoria Lee: And then i've also had some a role.

247
00:36:49,950 --> 00:37:01,440
Anne Victoria Lee: With a sandwiches addiction medicine society of America and in 2008 2020 I was an officer and.

248
00:37:01,440 --> 00:37:17,310
Anne Victoria Lee: We advocated for various policy changes on the federal, as well as the State level and I went to Washington DC and participated in some leadership conferences and we practice getting pitches to.

249
00:37:17,310 --> 00:37:32,820
Anne Victoria Lee: A lot of different cabinet members and then I also just stated, and I went met the Governor of Oregon Kate Brown and she was so warm and she was so friendly and, at the end of our meeting.

250
00:37:32,820 --> 00:37:40,050
Anne Victoria Lee: she gave me a big hug because I got really passionate about advocating for expanded.

251
00:37:40,050 --> 00:37:53,040
Anne Victoria Lee: addiction treatment services in the rural areas, which is where I lived at the time in Oregon so it was really nice and I had a lot of different role models for.

252
00:37:53,040 --> 00:38:15,630
Anne Victoria Lee: Leadership I can share favor the women because I feel like women have a harder world it started with my grandmother, and then it goes to whoever i'm working with at the time or someone who inspires me and like right and for my work i'm director Laura.

253
00:38:15,630 --> 00:38:25,350
Anne Victoria Lee: As I think she's awesome and whenever i'm working in a clinic if I work very well with a particular position.

254
00:38:25,350 --> 00:38:33,990
Anne Victoria Lee: I tend to be inspired and motivated by them and, like right now i'm really interested in DR Jenny Calvin i'll do.

255
00:38:33,990 --> 00:38:40,560
Anne Victoria Lee: Now, with me, each of us, I think she's really amazing and she has a very warm personal style.

256
00:38:40,560 --> 00:38:51,780
Anne Victoria Lee: And she's very relatable, and so I think that's a great quality, because if you're a leader, you also have to appeal to everyday people so that's a.

257
00:38:51,780 --> 00:38:56,790
Laura Power: Great example yeah.

258
00:38:56,790 --> 00:39:03,390
Laura Power: welcome any and nice to have you said she's one of our preventive medicine residents as well, so.

259
00:39:03,390 --> 00:39:11,460
Laura Power: I know me pretty well, but I didn't know all those stories i'm always every time I talk to you and I always learned something new and interesting about her, she has a lot of very interesting path.

260
00:39:11,460 --> 00:39:26,730
Laura Power: Dr Johnny khaldoon is the chief medical executive for our state health department, I think one of the articles I posted on your canvas page was a reflection about just the code experience so that might be interesting to check out there, too, so thank you.

261
00:39:26,730 --> 00:39:36,180
Laura Power: All right, I know we're getting there but it's I think it's important to do these introductions and I think it's nice to really know who's who because a lot of this is discussion based and it's helpful to.

262
00:39:36,180 --> 00:39:46,830
Laura Power: Just know everyone's background so don't worry i'll get us through that first lecture in time for a break and everything, this is the more exciting part to me so next is quintin.

263
00:39:46,830 --> 00:39:53,940
Quintin Solano: Everyone, my name is Clinton Solano, I go by Q, if you want either ways fine with me.

264
00:39:53,940 --> 00:40:03,570
Quintin Solano: i'm a fourth year medical student at the University of Michigan here i'm doing my masters in clinical research I just started this month, so these are actually my first few courses that i've been going through.

265
00:40:03,570 --> 00:40:07,050
Quintin Solano: currently living in Ann arbor i'm from Detroit Michigan.

266
00:40:07,050 --> 00:40:13,290
Quintin Solano: And once you've m dearborn for undergrad leadership experience, so I coached youth sports for five years.

267
00:40:13,290 --> 00:40:19,230
Quintin Solano: Both as a head coach and like coordinator and stuff like that also coached weightlifting and things.

268
00:40:19,230 --> 00:40:36,180
Quintin Solano: of that nature and then served on different boards and stuff like that in the Medical School and undergrad as well spent a lot of time thinking about leadership reading about it as well, multiple authors that I can point to that i've learned great lessons from my leadership role model.

269
00:40:36,180 --> 00:40:51,270
Quintin Solano: You know I would I would definitely say my parents, a lot of people have said that I completely agree, I would say, somebody more proximal to maybe, many of us, Dr justin dimmick who's the Chair of the Department of surgery here at the University of Michigan.

270
00:40:51,270 --> 00:41:00,570
Quintin Solano: You know throughout the pandemic and things like that we had a lot of time to kind of hang out on social media read a lot more of our emails and stuff and I thought he did a really good job of not only.

271
00:41:00,570 --> 00:41:09,360
Quintin Solano: Excuse me saying a lot of things, you know that you know inspired the workforce and was there for his people, but he was out there on the floor, he was showing up to the coven units.

272
00:41:09,360 --> 00:41:13,980
Quintin Solano: Bringing food working with them picking up extra shifts giving out vaccines when they came out.

273
00:41:13,980 --> 00:41:23,160
Quintin Solano: And I think that demonstrates, you know, one of the core principles of leadership which is you know being there for your people developing those relationships and kind of getting on the ground floor and not.

274
00:41:23,160 --> 00:41:26,670
Quintin Solano: You know I thought his leadership as a kid which is barking orders.

275
00:41:26,670 --> 00:41:31,470
Quintin Solano: So I would, I would say he's a really good example of a good leader great example and I don't.

276
00:41:31,470 --> 00:41:35,400
Laura Power: Know Dr dinner very well so it's interesting to to hear that.

277
00:41:35,400 --> 00:41:44,220
Laura Power: description so welcome Q and I would imagine your experience in youth sports too I would imagine there's a lot of leadership skills that are required to do that so.

278
00:41:44,220 --> 00:41:53,220
Laura Power: sounds like you're also very well read too so i'm excited to kind of have you and Kate any and everybody else you know just kind of add to the comments as we go through things.

279
00:41:53,220 --> 00:41:55,110
Quintin Solano: Thank you welcome.

280
00:41:55,110 --> 00:41:58,650
Laura Power: And next up i've got brandon.

281
00:41:58,650 --> 00:42:03,630
Brandon Lee Ellsworth: Hello everyone and brandon ellsworth ago but brandon.

282
00:42:03,630 --> 00:42:21,600
Brandon Lee Ellsworth: slide background i'm from Colorado Michigan to just like 40 minutes away from here, I went to hope college for undergrad and now i'm also a medical student at the University of Michigan my fourth year currently taking a year out, to do the same master's program is quentin.

283
00:42:21,600 --> 00:42:31,020
Brandon Lee Ellsworth: Previous leadership experience as one of the leaders on my I played college football says wanted leaders they're bad variety of roles in the Medical School.

284
00:42:31,020 --> 00:42:42,090
Brandon Lee Ellsworth: and also during my master's here, so far as far as a role model I can think of a specific role model, but I think the qualities that I.

285
00:42:42,090 --> 00:42:53,400
Brandon Lee Ellsworth: Like the most in the leaders that I read about the most and try and learn more about emulate are the ones that can public speak well and the ones that can really motivate a group of people think there's a lot of.

286
00:42:53,400 --> 00:43:01,470
Brandon Lee Ellsworth: qualities to leadership and not everyone has to have all of them, no one really has all of them, I think the ones that are really good at doing that are.

287
00:43:01,470 --> 00:43:08,820
Laura Power: Once I try and surround myself with that makes sense, I feel like that connects back to josh talking about Dr g.

288
00:43:08,820 --> 00:43:16,740
Laura Power: You know, being a good public speaker and he's been out there i've kind of lines up with what you were saying so welcome brandon nice to have you.

289
00:43:16,740 --> 00:43:20,040
Laura Power: Next Sammy Sammy lions.

290
00:43:20,040 --> 00:43:29,130
Sammie Lyons (she/her): Yes, hi i'm Sammy my full name is samantha you might hear my dogs are barking quite a bit to toxins.

291
00:43:29,130 --> 00:43:32,580
Sammie Lyons (she/her): And i'm just going to pull up the information that you want it.

292
00:43:32,580 --> 00:43:40,680
Sammie Lyons (she/her): I am I guess halfway between my third and fourth year of Medical School I started a master of science and clinical research, a couple months ago.

293
00:43:40,680 --> 00:43:51,060
Sammie Lyons (she/her): And then i'll likely be taking additional time off to pursue a PhD in bioethics i'm currently in lavonia I was previously in Ann arbor.

294
00:43:51,060 --> 00:44:04,170
Sammie Lyons (she/her): In terms of work, study experience various different part time jobs before Medical School but I did a lot of yoga teaching and I also wrote for the university so similar to.

295
00:44:04,170 --> 00:44:17,160
Sammie Lyons (she/her): Brighton I had big athletic leadership experience and then within undergrad and the Medical School I also hold various leadership roles in terms of my leadership role model.

296
00:44:17,160 --> 00:44:20,760
Sammie Lyons (she/her): That is a very hard.

297
00:44:20,760 --> 00:44:34,860
Sammie Lyons (she/her): question to answer, so I would say my most recent leadership influence would have to be Dr renee brown she has a podcast called dare to lead and I think i've listened to almost every single one of her podcast.

298
00:44:34,860 --> 00:44:43,230
Sammie Lyons (she/her): I like the way she speaks the she I think it was Anthony who was talking about earlier between empathic but still commanding.

299
00:44:43,230 --> 00:44:53,220
Sammie Lyons (she/her): respect and attention, and that is how I feel about her, I felt like she is the combination of that entirely, and one of the things that she addresses that I wanted to.

300
00:44:53,220 --> 00:45:03,750
Sammie Lyons (she/her): bring up is like she does not like the term soft skills and neither do I, because I think it undermines the importance of these skills we always emphasize hard skills, but.

301
00:45:03,750 --> 00:45:19,650
Sammie Lyons (she/her): To me there's not really a difference, but both of them are important they're just unique skill sets and positing one heart and one saw really I think undermines the skills that are actually really critical to leading groups.

302
00:45:19,650 --> 00:45:21,060
Laura Power: what's another word.

303
00:45:21,060 --> 00:45:24,060
Sammie Lyons (she/her): To use instead of soft.

304
00:45:24,060 --> 00:45:24,390
Laura Power: Which.

305
00:45:24,390 --> 00:45:27,480
Sammie Lyons (she/her): I agree, I don't know, sometimes I.

306
00:45:27,480 --> 00:45:30,090
Just like skills.

307
00:45:30,090 --> 00:45:34,170
Laura Power: Actually i'll show you a slide but often something that's also used as.

308
00:45:34,170 --> 00:45:45,450
Laura Power: Like in public health you'll see you i'll show you the little there's like a tea that talks about the strategic skills, and especially the specific skills and it's kind of one of those strategic skills skills your leadership skills.

309
00:45:45,450 --> 00:45:50,970
Laura Power: But it's funny because I actually in our i've been class with josh took the class with me.

310
00:45:50,970 --> 00:46:00,120
Laura Power: Is our professional development class, and you know, sometimes we talk about it, like it's soft skills, but really it's like super important but epidemiology and.

311
00:46:00,120 --> 00:46:09,270
Laura Power: The quantitative side of it is often considered like the hard skill that I totally appreciate what you're saying family i'm glad you brought that up.

312
00:46:09,270 --> 00:46:17,250
Laura Power: And if you have any these great resources like you're welcome to stick, the link for Dr renee Brown and in the chat if you want for others.

313
00:46:17,250 --> 00:46:29,880
Laura Power: I can't I think i've come across her as well, I don't think I put her on the canvas page, but if you guys have any great resources, you want shared I can try to you know capture those for leader to so welcome Sam i'm glad you're here thanks.

314
00:46:29,880 --> 00:46:43,950
Sammie Lyons (she/her): I said, for those who don't know Dr Bernie brown she's a qualitative researcher and does a lot of work on shame and vulnerability and how you can use the power of your vulnerability to lead groups and be courageous in your day to day life.

315
00:46:43,950 --> 00:46:45,120
Sammie Lyons (she/her): Thank you.

316
00:46:45,120 --> 00:46:49,470
Laura Power: All right next we have Douglas.

317
00:46:49,470 --> 00:46:55,290
Douglas Frederic Werkman: hey good afternoon i'm Douglas workmen Douglas or dog is fine.

318
00:46:55,290 --> 00:47:00,330
Douglas Frederic Werkman: I went to Michigan for undergrad i'm from the southwest part of the State small town.

319
00:47:00,330 --> 00:47:10,860
Douglas Frederic Werkman: And then i'm currently dental student of your dental student i'm also doing me master of science clinical research i'm on the tail end of it, along with a few of my colleagues and class with us here.

320
00:47:10,860 --> 00:47:20,430
Douglas Frederic Werkman: um I think for past leadership experience, probably the most significant thing that I did was I kind of during a gap period before I went to Grad school and that would be.

321
00:47:20,430 --> 00:47:28,320
Douglas Frederic Werkman: my hometown is a really low graduation rate high school, and so I went back and created an organization, along with a friend of mine.

322
00:47:28,320 --> 00:47:36,300
Douglas Frederic Werkman: That served to our primary goal is to allow Yemeni American youth in the area which we have a high population of to achieve higher education.

323
00:47:36,300 --> 00:47:46,590
Douglas Frederic Werkman: And those are really cool experience for me and taught me a lot about leadership in general, because it's pretty far out of bounds of what my you know educational training is but was very.

324
00:47:46,590 --> 00:47:53,370
Douglas Frederic Werkman: kind of inspired what the rest of my career has been which is kind of increasing access to care to underserved populations is very important to me.

325
00:47:53,370 --> 00:48:02,070
Douglas Frederic Werkman: And that's kind of reflected in my leadership during dental schools been serving on various boards, you know for free clinics and things like that.

326
00:48:02,070 --> 00:48:19,050
Douglas Frederic Werkman: i'd say for my somebody who inspires me from a leadership perspective would be my research Dr RON RON a bitch and that would be because compared to other mentors i've had in the past he's very you know he wants everyone to feel equal and he goes way out of his way.

327
00:48:19,050 --> 00:48:28,860
Douglas Frederic Werkman: Sorry, that was an incoming call it luck my screen anyways he goes out of his way to make everyone feel equal he you know oral surgery, in general, our department has a very big diversity problem.

328
00:48:28,860 --> 00:48:36,000
Douglas Frederic Werkman: And he's taken initiatives to make a few national organizations like we have a women in oral surgery symposium every year now.

329
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:49,590
Douglas Frederic Werkman: Trying to track more talent that way, which is really awesome and yeah I mean he treats all of us like future colleagues, instead of you know what subordinates or something and yeah I strive to emulate pretty much everything that he does great, though.

330
00:48:49,590 --> 00:48:54,120
Laura Power: I think we met before through that talking about mf er I think right.

331
00:48:54,120 --> 00:48:59,010
Laura Power: yeah yeah i'm gonna say it's been a little while.

332
00:48:59,010 --> 00:49:05,580
Douglas Frederic Werkman: Here, because I need them a car students along the way, but really enjoyed this class where I tend to get to know them a car.

333
00:49:05,580 --> 00:49:17,190
Laura Power: A little bit better so cool nice to have you here all right we're getting there to more people to meet so next I got Michael Brian.

334
00:49:17,190 --> 00:49:22,680
Laura Power: So, Michael if you're there go ahead and unmute yourself.

335
00:49:22,680 --> 00:49:28,050

345
00:50:40,140 --> 00:50:51,090
Michael-Ryan Lowe: called Columbus Mississippi so you know i'm like, on the other side from you guys I know most you're either located in Michigan I think I won't hurt, I think I heard someone say something about Texas as well, so.

346
00:50:51,090 --> 00:51:09,240
Michael-Ryan Lowe: i'm currently in Mississippi it's a it's a lot different than where you guys are currently located um as far as like work and study experience um prior to well I went to undergrad at Mississippi State University in starkville so we're we're bulldogs we just recently won.

347
00:51:09,240 --> 00:51:19,140
Michael-Ryan Lowe: The College championship at baseball so that was pretty exciting when an undergrad I did a lot of leadership on things.

348
00:51:19,140 --> 00:51:27,600
Michael-Ryan Lowe: I lead organizations, I was a student association and also as a firefighter too, so I would say that's pretty you know.

349
00:51:27,600 --> 00:51:36,960
Michael-Ryan Lowe: Notable leadership experience I really have fun with that um when my leadership roles and different things like I was saying, you know I lead different organizations, I was in.

350
00:51:36,960 --> 00:51:51,570
Michael-Ryan Lowe: um on I kind of had my hands at different things, my friends, pretty pretty much refer to me as a jack of all trades, so if you name it I probably done in some way, shape or form and, as far as like a leadership role model um.

351
00:51:51,570 --> 00:51:59,340
Michael-Ryan Lowe: I don't want to necessarily say I have any one particularly at the moment um.

352
00:51:59,340 --> 00:52:05,010
Michael-Ryan Lowe: I don't really know um I don't know I don't really.

353
00:52:05,010 --> 00:52:08,940
Laura Power: mind and you've had lots of lots of examples here and so as we go through the.

354
00:52:08,940 --> 00:52:10,860
Laura Power: Class maybe there'll be some people that.

355
00:52:10,860 --> 00:52:18,000
Laura Power: strike you or maybe things that we talk about well make you think of that person that you know who's been a good leader so.

356
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:22,080
Michael-Ryan Lowe: Oh yeah absolutely yeah I can't take any one off the top my head, maybe later.

357
00:52:22,080 --> 00:52:33,630
Laura Power: nope that's that's usually how it goes i've done this before and usually people can't quite think of one but it's often, like many of you have noticed, or just specific qualities and things like that the standout do you go my Michael Ryan.

358
00:52:33,630 --> 00:52:45,030
Michael-Ryan Lowe: Honestly, I tell people you know you can call me Michael you call me Ryan, you call me Mike Ryan, you know i'll everywhere, I go someone calls me something different so it's whatever works best for you.

00:52:52,830 --> 00:53:07,980
Michael-Ryan Lowe: i'm at i'm at Jackson State University and I also be graduate training um which is like a consolidation between Jackson state and I didn't receive medical Center so yeah I have my hand a little bit of everything.

Michael-Ryan Lowe: Thank you.

365
00:53:10,650 --> 00:53:20,790
Laura Power: And last but not least, I see I think it's gave and I know you've been kind of popping in and out so i'm wondering if you're having troubles but they're welcome.

366
00:53:20,790 --> 00:53:21,840
Gabe?s iPhone: How are you.

367
00:53:21,840 --> 00:53:25,440
Laura Power: hey good, how are you welcome go ahead and introduce yourself.

368
00:53:25,440 --> 00:53:32,820
Gabe?s iPhone: Oh great greetings everybody, my name is Gabriel Gardner i'm currently a third semester master student at Jackson State University.

369
00:53:32,820 --> 00:53:44,490
Gabe?s iPhone: wow be getting my masters in public health with a concentration of epidemiology currently i'm a part of the Jackson heart study program which is located in Jackson Mississippi where our farm.

370
00:53:44,490 --> 00:53:54,180
Gabe?s iPhone: There i've been studying and doing working on a research proposal to develop around cardiovascular disease, as it pertains to stress and other mental illnesses.

371
00:53:54,180 --> 00:54:12,150
Gabe?s iPhone: um as far as it goes leadership background i'm very limited in the field of public health, considering that my background comes from a biochemistry undergraduate I attend alcorn State University I graduated in May 2020 with the biochemistry degree.

372
00:54:12,150 --> 00:54:25,500
Gabe?s iPhone: I had other leadership roles and other organizations such as band and i'm fraternities and things like that, but my main experience has came from doing a lot of research, I do research.

373
00:54:25,500 --> 00:54:39,810
Gabe?s iPhone: work, I want to say summer 2019 West allis nuclear proteins that it pertained to parkinson's disease, so there was a very interesting research that got me pretty much into the idea of doing research work.

374
00:54:39,810 --> 00:54:44,400
Gabe?s iPhone: Leadership as far as like leader role models.

375
00:54:44,400 --> 00:54:54,180
Gabe?s iPhone: is very limited, I have been i've had a couple of teachers that kind of got me into the field of public health far as what they saw in my interest developed over there.

376
00:54:54,180 --> 00:54:58,590
Gabe?s iPhone: And I plan on I wanted to take this class because I wanted to.

377
00:54:58,590 --> 00:55:09,900
Gabe?s iPhone: Just pretty much get the idea of what it takes to be a leader when it comes to the political sphere, because there's something that we really just don't talk about a lot of there and I feel like it can be helpful in the future.

378
00:55:09,900 --> 00:55:13,650
Laura Power: If I got it right you're a Jackson Jackson State University.

379
00:55:13,650 --> 00:55:14,490
Gabe?s iPhone: Yes, now.

380
00:55:14,490 --> 00:55:18,300
Laura Power: Michael Ryan, is that, where you said you are too.

381
00:55:18,300 --> 00:55:20,820
Michael-Ryan Lowe: Oh yes, ma'am we're actually in the same Program.

382
00:55:20,820 --> 00:55:23,760
Laura Power: Okay we're trying to do each other here so.

383
00:55:23,760 --> 00:55:28,890
yeah.

384
00:55:28,890 --> 00:55:37,950
Laura Power: All right, well what a group, so I you know I thank you for taking the time I know we did like a like an hour of introductions but i'm actually really glad that we did that.

385
00:55:37,950 --> 00:55:44,580
Laura Power: was really nice to get to know all you, I can see that I have a very strong class, and I think you're going to keep me on my toes here.

386
00:55:44,580 --> 00:55:50,580
Laura Power: And I welcome that so i'm excited about that i'm going to pull up some slides to kind of go through.

387
00:55:50,580 --> 00:56:09,060
Laura Power: One an overview of the class and then some overview of public health topics, and I am keep being mindful of the time, but I got ideas about what I want to get to the overview stuff if I can get through pretty I think will will still be able to get to a break around.

388
00:56:09,060 --> 00:56:19,080
Laura Power: But what round three so i'll be a little activity in there, too, but that will kind of be to do on your own so i'll keep it going here what i'm going to do.

389
00:56:19,080 --> 00:56:27,120
Laura Power: Is pull up my slides just to kind of guide us through and some of this to my slides if you're if you're looking at the canvas page.

390
00:56:27,120 --> 00:56:39,360
Laura Power: Please, you know go ahead and take a peek in there because i'm going to go through, just like the structure of the class and then some topic stuff yeah first of all, can you all see my.

391
00:56:39,360 --> 00:56:41,820
Laura Power: Guy right slides up for you, I think right you're seeing the.

392
00:56:41,820 --> 00:56:48,210
Laura Power: slides hold for it sounds okay excellent all right, thank you so.

393
00:56:48,210 --> 00:56:52,590
Laura Power: Okay, so just to kind of move things along here, you know this like I said is.

394
00:56:52,590 --> 00:57:05,520
Laura Power: As we will think of a better word than soft skills, but thinking about leadership skills and things like systems thinking and how this all fits into the concept of public health 3.0 and what i've tried to do is.

395
00:57:05,520 --> 00:57:13,200
Laura Power: You know map things out where we talk about general leadership, then we talk about leadership specifically more about in public health.

396
00:57:13,200 --> 00:57:23,400
Laura Power: Then we start to think about systems thinking, which is a skill that I think is important for, especially for public health leaders and how that plays out in things like.

397
00:57:23,400 --> 00:57:30,030
Laura Power: Policy and working across sectors and then kind of bringing it home with thinking about.

398
00:57:30,030 --> 00:57:36,600
Laura Power: Building a vision and what you know, having your vision and mission statement and understanding your values and I try to link that all together.

399
00:57:36,600 --> 00:57:46,020
Laura Power: And we have a combination of lectures and some discussion and activities and, as I say here, and I would the point I really want to make from this slide is that.

400
00:57:46,020 --> 00:57:55,020
Laura Power: Students are encouraged to bring real world experience to class, and you know I can tell from all these introductions that you've all had great experiences and.

401
00:57:55,020 --> 00:58:12,090
Laura Power: you've done a lot of reading and thinking about leadership you're working some of you are working in public health settings so I want you to interrupt me I want you to ask questions or you know add two things as they come so I just want to say that.

402
00:58:12,090 --> 00:58:18,120
Laura Power: For those of you interested as class does cover some of these competencies and background is classes originally built.

403
00:58:18,120 --> 00:58:26,580
Laura Power: It was built specifically to cover some of these competencies that was part of the motivation of this class that was needed at a certain time in our curriculum.

404
00:58:26,580 --> 00:58:41,070
Laura Power: So some of it is it's really built through the one about leadership and then I tie in systems thinking and a little bit about public health, health equity related to policy and kind of health and all policies concepts.

405
00:58:41,070 --> 00:58:49,080
Laura Power: These are the list of learning objectives and you'll see they kind of line up with how i've got the days mapped out.

406
00:58:49,080 --> 00:59:01,140
Laura Power: And this is just I pulled this from the syllabus you can download the full syllabus from the canvas page but it's just sort of the like the basically the daily agenda that will go through, and there are some assignments, which all.

407
00:59:01,140 --> 00:59:07,980
Laura Power: instruct you, you know, as you know what to do, but basically there's points for.

408
00:59:07,980 --> 00:59:18,780
Laura Power: Participation and attendance points so basically participating if if you're someone taking this class or credit and for whatever reason you're not able to make it just check in with me and we'll we'll figure something out.

409
00:59:18,780 --> 00:59:24,900
Laura Power: But then other other than that there's also these activities and assignments and there's a team presentation you'll do at the end.

410
00:59:24,900 --> 00:59:34,800
Laura Power: i'll I like I said I try to build it so that you are doing this during class, so I try and hoping that you'll get most of the work done for the class during class time.

411
00:59:34,800 --> 00:59:40,860
Laura Power: So, like I said the class, I want you to just you know ask questions you know.

412
00:59:40,860 --> 00:59:50,040
Laura Power: You know, feel free to interrupt me, you can use the chat, if you like, i'm I try to pay attention the chat I know josh is watching the chat for me, too, because I get distracted with my slides.

413
00:59:50,040 --> 00:59:58,050
Laura Power: But you feel free to unmute yourself just go ahead and just kind of add in I think it keeps everybody awake and more engaged or having.

414
00:59:58,050 --> 01:00:04,260
Laura Power: Some questions so and, of course, you know take breaks as needed I like having your videos on but.

415
01:00:04,260 --> 01:00:15,390
Laura Power: You know I get it if you need to turn them off you're eating whatnot I would say during the lecture part, you know that you're going to turn off this probably the oh, you know okay time turn off during the lectures, but.

416
01:00:15,390 --> 01:00:22,350
Laura Power: we're going we're talking and interacting with each other, I think it's nice to have the videos on if you're if you're able to.

417
01:00:22,350 --> 01:00:31,050
Laura Power: Questions about the class do you want to look at the canvas speech together, do you guys feel like you, you feel pretty good about the canvas page.

418
01:00:31,050 --> 01:00:34,950
Laura Power: Let me know as soon as your thumbs up all right.

419
01:00:34,950 --> 01:00:35,280
Kate Schedel (she/her/hers): Okay.

420
01:00:35,280 --> 01:00:41,100
Laura Power: Okay yeah cuz I can't see most of your faces i'm going to go by the thumbs up because your video there.

421
01:00:41,100 --> 01:00:49,290
Laura Power: Alright, so just let me know because I usually look at your faces to know how i'm doing so, if things are not going good you can turn back on, and let me know okay.

422
01:00:49,290 --> 01:00:58,860
Laura Power: Alright, so let me keep track of time here it is 230 good Okay, so now we'll move into our lecture.

423
01:00:58,860 --> 01:01:17,760
Laura Power: period here and the focus of this lecture is thinking about the concept of public health 3.0 and maybe with it, I show them the thumbs up or maybe thumbs down, have you heard of public health 3.0 if so maybe give me a thumbs up.

424
01:01:17,760 --> 01:01:35,460
Laura Power: Okay, so I see, I see a mix okay that's good so i'm glad that some of you heard of it, and some of you have not, so I will introduce this to you for those of you who don't know it, and then we'll think about you know why are we talking about this in their public health leadership class.

425
01:01:35,460 --> 01:01:44,820
Laura Power: Now first i'm stepping back so basically going to give us a what is public house 3.0 so i'm stepping back to talk about the definition of public health, what is public health.

426
01:01:44,820 --> 01:01:53,880
Laura Power: And you probably all have different ways that you describe a public health is i'm not going to I want to ask you now to define it but.

427
01:01:53,880 --> 01:02:01,740
Laura Power: I you maybe you've got your elevator speech of what is public health and maybe you've had to explain it to your family members of your studying public health.

428
01:02:01,740 --> 01:02:05,250
Laura Power: So, think about what your definition of public health is.

429
01:02:05,250 --> 01:02:16,020
Laura Power: The reason i'm asking you to think about that as i'm just going to kind of go through very briefly some overview what what How does public health How has it evolved and how we got into public health 3.0.

430
01:02:16,020 --> 01:02:24,180
Laura Power: But the idea of public health has really been around for a long time since you know, since I if, through our society is to.

431
01:02:24,180 --> 01:02:29,970
Laura Power: You know, try to protect the health of people really and that's one way people look at public health are thinking about.

432
01:02:29,970 --> 01:02:47,040
Laura Power: keeping us healthy where we live, work and play that's been around for a long time so there's been strategies like quarantine and water, safety and how to do sewer systems that's been around since even the pre modern era.

433
01:02:47,040 --> 01:02:55,050
Laura Power: And then around like early 19th century there was some focus on thinking about you know, hygiene and.

434
01:02:55,050 --> 01:03:07,620
Laura Power: This this time period was called the great cemetery awakening and many different things in history that came along with this, but there was a big focus on social reform on hygiene on keeping track of.

435
01:03:07,620 --> 01:03:21,000
Laura Power: Data the sanitary survey of the state, I will mule shattuck is one example of something that came out during that time, where it was really taking a look at the statistics and understanding the disease and how things were.

436
01:03:21,000 --> 01:03:24,180
Laura Power: How diseases were distributed and what could be done.

437
01:03:24,180 --> 01:03:34,080
Laura Power: In a status to look after the health of people, and so this was kind of considered the great sanitary awakening, this is the time of Jon snow and the broad street pump, of course.

438
01:03:34,080 --> 01:03:47,340
Laura Power: So under the you know the cholera outbreak and understanding how that came about and how the connections there during that time to as things progress in a science and things about science really evolved.

439
01:03:47,340 --> 01:04:04,470
Laura Power: You know, during this time, there was a focus on, you know bacteriology and scientific knowledge and understanding disease, so we had Cox postulates and pasteurization and really understanding Microbiology and the emergence of disease, so there was a big focus on science, during this time.

440
01:04:04,470 --> 01:04:18,060
Laura Power: And as time goes on in the 20th century, you know we start to know more science is more developed, we have now we've got antibiotics that come around immunizations we have treatments and things that people can do to help.

441
01:04:18,060 --> 01:04:27,180
Laura Power: Take care of people public health practitioners around that time so we've been very focused on it as much on science to kind of move beyond and.

442
01:04:27,180 --> 01:04:36,660
Laura Power: There was there is actually a larger role of public health practitioners during that time being involved in treatment of individuals such as giving immunizations and anti toxins.

443
01:04:36,660 --> 01:04:46,200
Laura Power: Some of that was actually ministered through health departments and public health practitioners at the time now that's tends to be more on the physician or health care provider role.

444
01:04:46,200 --> 01:04:53,730
Laura Power: You know nurse practitioners and things like that, but, at the time it was there was a role of the public health practitioners played in now.

445
01:04:53,730 --> 01:04:59,940
Laura Power: Also, during this time in the 20th century, the Federal government's role got mom much more established.

446
01:04:59,940 --> 01:05:10,020
Laura Power: And we've had the United States postal service had been around and it got even more formalized during this time, so i'd say things are getting a bit more, because many more governmental programs were.

447
01:05:10,020 --> 01:05:20,040
Laura Power: Coming around so health departments getting involved in providing care and overseeing the US public health service that was in the 20th century.

448
01:05:20,040 --> 01:05:28,050
Laura Power: I wonder if you're if any of you are familiar with this report, the Institute of medicine, the future of public health, it was published in 1980.

449
01:05:28,050 --> 01:05:37,770
Laura Power: And now, so good, I see I see one face on there, I see Laura acknowledging that one so good and Aaron, so I think especially our public health.

450
01:05:37,770 --> 01:05:53,250
Laura Power: Practitioners may be familiar with this, but this is an older document now, it was published in 1988, but it was a big foundation of understanding public health at this time and what this is a long document you can I.

451
01:05:53,250 --> 01:06:03,390
Laura Power: it's free to access and they kind of went through to assess the state of public health, so you can see there's all this development, all these different programs.

452
01:06:03,390 --> 01:06:13,140
Laura Power: Local state Federal Government will health programs, but as they go through this they basically one of the main main takeaway I like to point out is that one.

453
01:06:13,140 --> 01:06:19,470
Laura Power: kind of introductory conclusion was that basically public health was in disarray in the United States.

454
01:06:19,470 --> 01:06:25,590
Laura Power: That there there's kind of lost sight of what its goals were and the system wasn't really well in place.

455
01:06:25,590 --> 01:06:31,500
Laura Power: And so it was in disarray, and appointed out different emerging threats at the time, like AIDS epidemic.

456
01:06:31,500 --> 01:06:36,510
Laura Power: resurgence interpreter girl says and thinking about other injuries and chronic illness as well, so.

457
01:06:36,510 --> 01:06:49,620
Laura Power: They point out in this that public health was in disarray, and the reason, this is important and stands out to a lot of people in public health is that, through this, then this is really where public health became more.

458
01:06:49,620 --> 01:06:58,410
Laura Power: professionalized and there were more performance standards created and and through this there was the core functions of public health that were described.

459
01:06:58,410 --> 01:07:10,740
Laura Power: So many of you may know this, especially those of you working in as a public health practitioner right now you're probably very aware of the three core functions of public health, which were described as assessment.

460
01:07:10,740 --> 01:07:21,270
Laura Power: policy development and assurance, so there anything about all what public health is supposed to do and they boil it down to these three core functions.

461
01:07:21,270 --> 01:07:34,050
Laura Power: So assessment understanding the situation and needs of the Community policy development setting goals based on assessment data and Community values and assurance assuring the public goals will be achieved.

462
01:07:34,050 --> 01:07:41,130
Laura Power: All of those functions are really supposed to help meet what public health is and the way that public health was defined in this.

463
01:07:41,130 --> 01:07:49,110
Laura Power: iowa 1988 report was a public health is what we do as a society to ensure the conditions in which everyone can be healthy.

464
01:07:49,110 --> 01:08:02,160
Laura Power: that's my favorite definition of public house and when I asked that question at the beginning there's many different definitions, but I do like this one, which came from from this report so Those are the three core functions of public health.

465
01:08:02,160 --> 01:08:09,720
Laura Power: So they're pretty broad, though, like the three core function, how do you get that done, how do you assess policy developer sure what does that really mean.

466
01:08:09,720 --> 01:08:20,460
Laura Power: Well, in 1994 to kind of add to this and contribute more to this professionalization and structuring of public health, trying to not be in disarray, and get things more organized.

467
01:08:20,460 --> 01:08:28,260
Laura Power: This idea of the 10 essential public health services came around, and these are the 10 services or mental really.

468
01:08:28,260 --> 01:08:38,310
Laura Power: encompass and fall and, as you can see their assessment policy development assurance May was where the 10 essential services and somehow.

469
01:08:38,310 --> 01:08:48,000
Laura Power: Whether it's through the health department or other entities that are associated these actions were to get done in order to help promote the health of our Community.

470
01:08:48,000 --> 01:09:01,980
Laura Power: And maybe i'll just stop here and just like any other any of our anyone in the class might want to reflect, especially our public health practitioners, if you want Are you familiar with the 10 essential public health services are these useful to you and your work.

471
01:09:01,980 --> 01:09:10,170
Out there real quick.

472
01:09:10,170 --> 01:09:19,620
Laura Power: Yes, if you are familiar with them you'll see they've been updated so take remember what this looks like now, since 1994.

473
01:09:19,620 --> 01:09:30,480
Laura Power: That was a big Commission that came out to make this report with 10 services here they are again I won't read this all to you, but I will, I will say that some of my mentors.

474
01:09:30,480 --> 01:09:48,510
Laura Power: knew this by heart, where they would say to monitor to diagnose to inform and educate to mobilize to develop policies and so on, I have to admit I don't know them, I can not able to rattle them off like that maybe maybe some of you can or know people that can do that, but.

475
01:09:48,510 --> 01:09:54,870
Laura Power: They are important and they do relate to things like public health accreditation and.

476
01:09:54,870 --> 01:10:07,380
Laura Power: You know, assessment of how how evaluating the services of a public health setting, how are these things getting done and you'll see that you know, sometimes, this is not just.

477
01:10:07,380 --> 01:10:14,280
Laura Power: Not just through seo a governmental public health department, but maybe it's also some of the other connections that are in the Community so.

478
01:10:14,280 --> 01:10:19,350
Laura Power: Looking through the 10 essential services whether it's with the local health department and with other.

479
01:10:19,350 --> 01:10:29,310
Laura Power: collaborators somehow there's a way that these services need to be getting done so it's a way to give some more structure, along with those three core functions that we talked about.

480
01:10:29,310 --> 01:10:45,240
Laura Power: This is still getting the public health 3.0 so don't we're getting there so we're in we're kind of in public health two point O is now so that Institute of medicine report triggered like this next way of thinking about public health.

481
01:10:45,240 --> 01:10:55,920
Laura Power: So you know there's been a lot of successes with public health and maybe this is an older MW our report from 1999 to summarize the greatest public health achievements of the 20th century.

482
01:10:55,920 --> 01:11:04,410
Laura Power: And you know here they are they list them as vaccination motor vehicle safety saver workplaces, a lot of them are about controlling infectious diseases.

483
01:11:04,410 --> 01:11:13,980
Laura Power: For sex nation as part of that antibiotics fall into that declining deaths from chronic diseases like heart disease and stroke healthier foods healthier mothers and babies.

484
01:11:13,980 --> 01:11:27,420
Laura Power: And when planning fluoridation was a big one, and and understanding the harm of tobacco is a health hazard so huge achievements in our public health have happened in the 20th century.

485
01:11:27,420 --> 01:11:33,840
Laura Power: But you know there's still a lot of things that that aren't great and so it's kind of recognizing that we've made a lot of progress.

486
01:11:33,840 --> 01:11:42,000
Laura Power: But you know there's still things we're struggling with moving forward, and I think you know, these things are not going to surprise you, I think you're all familiar with.

487
01:11:42,000 --> 01:11:48,540
Laura Power: A lot of things that are, I think, really thinking about different health disparities and inequities in the data that we see.

488
01:11:48,540 --> 01:11:57,780
Laura Power: So just pulling out some examples in there, there are many, of course, but you know thinking about where you live, and how that affects your life expectancy, and this is an example of.

489
01:11:57,780 --> 01:12:08,400
Laura Power: Looking at Wayne county or you can see that you know there's a quite a difference, depending on where you live in the county of the average life expectancy.

490
01:12:08,400 --> 01:12:16,980
Laura Power: And then, looking at that on a larger scale looking at our country, you can see, to life expectancy varies by location.

491
01:12:16,980 --> 01:12:34,440
Laura Power: And, of course, by sex, race Hispanic origin, you can see, again, there are differences in what life expectancy is and we've seen this we've also seen life expectancy plateau in some cases, and even though I think we're hearing about sometimes declining.

492
01:12:34,440 --> 01:12:40,770
Laura Power: Looking at life expectancy and how we spend money in the US and see where the US is compared to other countries.

493
01:12:40,770 --> 01:12:51,600
Laura Power: Other things like obesity, increasing very significantly, especially in children and adolescents looking at deaths from drug use and seeing a big.

494
01:12:51,600 --> 01:12:59,820
Laura Power: spike in that over the recent years and really all that just to say that okay we've made great achievements but there's still a lot more to do.

495
01:12:59,820 --> 01:13:05,370
Laura Power: And so that's kind of where this idea of like what you know how do we get past this, what can we do next so.

496
01:13:05,370 --> 01:13:11,790
Laura Power: The way this idea of how a car 3.0 was was came about was this idea of time to upgrade so.

497
01:13:11,790 --> 01:13:22,890
Laura Power: recognizing that you know a lot of times, public health, work is sometimes done in a silo really in many it's not just public health right and many of the things that we do, we tend to work in silos.

498
01:13:22,890 --> 01:13:31,740
Laura Power: And that is important to work across the silos and really address you know, in order to address these complicated and complex problems.

499
01:13:31,740 --> 01:13:39,870
Laura Power: We have to work across silos and really try to get upstream and how we do that so.

500
01:13:39,870 --> 01:13:47,730
Laura Power: that's what the idea of public health 3.0 and this kinds of actually came out from our health and human services, it was launched in 2016.

501
01:13:47,730 --> 01:13:58,560
Laura Power: I will say the idea of focusing on social determinants of health that's not new, all of a sudden thought about in 2016, but it was just this way of kind of branding I think it was sort of a branding way.

502
01:13:58,560 --> 01:14:11,730
Laura Power: of trying to help public health in a structured way move and think about all the things that affect our health, all the determinants of health and really a sharper focus on the social determinants of health.

503
01:14:11,730 --> 01:14:18,900
Laura Power: i'm sure many of her heard that term at this point, so the conditions where we we we live, work and play.

504
01:14:18,900 --> 01:14:22,170
Laura Power: All those factors that affect that are the social determinants of health.

505
01:14:22,170 --> 01:14:32,760
Laura Power: So the political three point O is really trying to modernize was public health goals I showed you that from 1988 and the essential services, the core functions.

506
01:14:32,760 --> 01:14:40,170
Laura Power: Those are you know they're they're older now they're 1988 they've served as well they're very in those those ideas still exist i'll show you some.

507
01:14:40,170 --> 01:14:46,470
Laura Power: updates to them, but this idea of public health, three points just modernizing our public health goals and missions.

508
01:14:46,470 --> 01:14:56,910
Laura Power: and helping us to really, really focus on social determinants of health thinking about how to collaborate across sectors and kind of cross out and get out of those silos.

509
01:14:56,910 --> 01:15:11,730
Laura Power: So this this branding it was in 2016 so I was like looking back and saying Okay, we think public health 1.0 was kind of that focus on science, that I was talking about so vaccination and pasteurization and.

510
01:15:11,730 --> 01:15:22,890
Laura Power: Hygiene focus that was public health one point or learning ally big growth of knowledge, but not really so much focused on on the public health entities themselves and the structure of that.

511
01:15:22,890 --> 01:15:39,960
Laura Power: publico 2.0 came is often cited as the start around that future public health report in 1988 where there was really trying to structure, especially that was focused on government and public health, but giving us those core functions and the 10 essential services.

512
01:15:39,960 --> 01:15:45,570
Laura Power: And now saying okay well you know in 2016 they coined the term officially.

513
01:15:45,570 --> 01:15:54,090
Laura Power: Public Health 3.0 but really This idea has been around and they even in the papers that described the original papers that describe public health 3.0.

514
01:15:54,090 --> 01:16:11,130
Laura Power: They wreck recognize that's probably you know we're seeing many examples about with say the affordable care act and how, after the great recession like what how we responded to that so there's examples of public health, three point of starting around that time.

515
01:16:11,130 --> 01:16:20,820
Laura Power: And kind of beyond that so 2016 has been public health 3.0 came about that concept, at least as per the human health and human services.

516
01:16:20,820 --> 01:16:31,500
Laura Power: If you if you are familiar with the 10 essential services, you may notice and if you're not and you're new to you it's good to know they've been around since 1994 but it's even better, to know that they've been updated.

517
01:16:31,500 --> 01:16:39,420
Laura Power: So in 2020 and maybe this didn't really get as much attention because you know coven was sucking up all of our energy and brainpower.

518
01:16:39,420 --> 01:16:47,520
Laura Power: But the 10 essential services did get updated and I thought that was very interesting it's kind of neat to see I think how.

519
01:16:47,520 --> 01:17:00,270
Laura Power: Just how just the structure and the new ideas that come out and how they come out from often Federal Government and other nonprofit organizations that help to support these ideas so.

520
01:17:00,270 --> 01:17:14,790
Laura Power: In 2028 to 10 essential services of public health, were updated and do you notice any like can you remember what the differences here do you see anything that's different or what stands out to you.

521
01:17:14,790 --> 01:17:18,060
Kate Schedel (she/her/hers): This little wheel.

522
01:17:18,060 --> 01:17:22,200
Kate Schedel (she/her/hers): on putting equity at the Center of all of it.

523
01:17:22,200 --> 01:17:36,750
Laura Power: Excellent exactly and you'll notice that I think that Laura Laura isn't the same about the same yeah so equity here is not listed it's not one of the 10 essential services, but what the point is, is that this is to.

524
01:17:36,750 --> 01:17:41,970
Laura Power: have it all be towards and working towards equity Sammy go ahead.

525
01:17:41,970 --> 01:17:53,310
Sammie Lyons (she/her): here's The other thing that I noticed, I will i'm really particular about words, and I was looking at the utilize legal and regulatory actions and I thought that was really interesting.

526
01:17:53,310 --> 01:18:08,010
Sammie Lyons (she/her): phrasing compared to the previous one, which had said, I think, in force, which has, I mean there's similar meetings, but the language there's just different connotations, and I felt like this was.

527
01:18:08,010 --> 01:18:12,420
Sammie Lyons (she/her): More may I don't know what the right word to be friendly years.

528
01:18:12,420 --> 01:18:14,940
Sammie Lyons (she/her): For the right word but.

529
01:18:14,940 --> 01:18:16,410
Sammie Lyons (she/her): Something to that effect.

530
01:18:16,410 --> 01:18:18,300
Laura Power: yeah no I think that's a great point.

531
01:18:18,300 --> 01:18:24,570
Laura Power: I mean if you really do I didn't put like a I don't think i've put a comparison of the.

532
01:18:24,570 --> 01:18:27,840
Laura Power: here's the here they are written out.

533
01:18:27,840 --> 01:18:41,430
Laura Power: I don't think I have a map next to each other, though before and after kind of, but they are different, one thing that like somebody it's not as easy to do that, to monitor to diagnose to investigate to enforce.

534
01:18:41,430 --> 01:18:54,510
Laura Power: But I think they are written in a way that I think that's a great point to me that they're kind of I think they're just trying to be more like like friendly is a good word and maybe inclusive and on them go ahead.

535
01:18:54,510 --> 01:19:07,140
Anam: I was just gonna say another thing I just noticed was even so, like looking back at the older one, there was a lot of things like develop, so it was like thinking more about like we will just do this.

536
01:19:07,140 --> 01:19:20,010
Anam: versus like the new one is is, including terminology like you're creating champions it's building supporting so back to the point about use of language is really talking about like we as like.

537
01:19:20,010 --> 01:19:37,650
Anam: Just someone who's in public health we don't have to do everything we're bringing in people from the Community we're working collaboratively across it so like to the idea that we need to work across silos the language kind of reflects that a bit more, and that we don't do everything.

538
01:19:37,650 --> 01:19:39,960
Laura Power: I think that's a great way, to put it, and I think.

539
01:19:39,960 --> 01:19:44,970
Laura Power: I agree that definitely comes across here great.

540
01:19:44,970 --> 01:19:49,470
Laura Power: that's great i'm glad you could all reflect on that so.

541
01:19:49,470 --> 01:19:55,530
Laura Power: i'm going to I think i'm I think we've got some time for this, so what i'm going to do is.

542
01:19:55,530 --> 01:20:06,960
Laura Power: If it's all right i'm going to show a video and it'll be a few minutes long it's basically Karen de Silva, who was sort of the champion on public health 3.0 idea when it came out around 2016.

543
01:20:06,960 --> 01:20:10,560
Laura Power: I want this is just so you know what this comes from is.

544
01:20:10,560 --> 01:20:25,770
Laura Power: CDC does their own grand rounds sessions which you can go and like watch any of the recordings and then sometimes they do interviews after, so this is a she had done a grand rounds which the link is the second one there when i'm pulling this video from his or her like one on one.

545
01:20:25,770 --> 01:20:29,790
Laura Power: Discussion after like an interview after, so this is just her.

546
01:20:29,790 --> 01:20:39,450
Laura Power: i'm going to play so you can kind of absorb the idea of public health 3.0 a little bit more she kind of describes you here i'll be starting the video kind of a few minutes in before she describes.

547
01:20:39,450 --> 01:20:43,140
Laura Power: I think some from working on new New Orleans I think if I remember right.

548
01:20:43,140 --> 01:20:53,130
Laura Power: And then kind of they asked her about like what is public health 3.0 and what does that mean to you so she talks about that so i'm going to play it, I think you guys oh yeah let's see.

549
01:20:53,130 --> 01:21:01,140
Laura Power: Are you still you're still seeing my screen right okay just making sure I do the whole desktop so I might be confused as to where i'm sharing.

550
01:21:01,140 --> 01:21:07,680
Laura Power: So I hope you can hear this when I play it give me a thumbs up if you can hear health and all policies so.

551
01:21:07,680 --> 01:21:18,240
Laura Power: For people who haven't heard what public health three point O is or who have heard it but really aren't sure what it means, can you tell us where we stand.

552
01:21:18,240 --> 01:21:28,650
Laura Power: And what that concept means public health is undergoing an evolution it's transforming this and very organically, not only in communities like New Orleans.

553
01:21:28,650 --> 01:21:33,090
Laura Power: Where we were rethinking how we are approaching health and with whom we were approaching it.

554
01:21:33,090 --> 01:21:39,630
Laura Power: And, but i've learned that it's happening all across the country it's the next generation of public health practice.

555
01:21:39,630 --> 01:21:52,740
Laura Power: The early days 1.0 we're a time when the epidemiology told us that it was about communicable disease that was the the ways that we needed to support the public's health, sanitation and vaccinations in that period as examples.

556
01:21:52,740 --> 01:22:00,120
Laura Power: But as the epidemiology changed so did the work and focus of public health to chronic disease non communicable disease.

557
01:22:00,120 --> 01:22:15,930
Laura Power: And, and though that work isn't done we've made a lot of progress in that, in the space of non communicable disease clearly to really tackle more upstream that the causes of cardiovascular disease, the leading cause of death.

558
01:22:15,930 --> 01:22:22,950
Laura Power: Even injury, if you if you as you move down the list, it really is going to take a broader approach, and that means.

559
01:22:22,950 --> 01:22:32,550
Laura Power: Taking a health all policy policies approach to working with transportation or housing, but also really being able to lead the conversation and measure.

560
01:22:32,550 --> 01:22:44,790
Laura Power: The success of addressing social determinants so these public health three point O communities are building on their on point oh and 2.0 and really expanding their purview thinking about how they work in a multi sectoral fashion.

561
01:22:44,790 --> 01:22:50,040
Laura Power: And are either at the table or leading at the table, where appropriate.

562
01:22:50,040 --> 01:22:59,040
Laura Power: we're saying also that they're considering themselves responsible and accountable to be a chief health strategist on the front lines, this is a term that.

563
01:22:59,040 --> 01:23:05,850
Laura Power: can apply really to too many types of leaders on the front lines, but when the public health leaders began to see themselves as.

564
01:23:05,850 --> 01:23:17,460
Laura Power: Being strategically responsible not for executing on programs that are funding, but really leaning in and thinking ahead about the ways that they can broadly create a healthy environment, the conditions in which everyone can be healthy.

565
01:23:17,460 --> 01:23:28,530
Laura Power: Those are the communities where they're beginning to see a lot more success and reversing the course you know there's some really nice work by Ross chatty that looks at.

566
01:23:28,530 --> 01:23:38,820
Laura Power: More than a billion data points of people across this country and looks at life expectancy and what are the underlying characteristics that that predict which communities.

567
01:23:38,820 --> 01:23:44,940
Laura Power: are healthier and the public health is not called out and network, specifically, there are a lot of recurrent themes and it.

568
01:23:44,940 --> 01:23:52,530
Laura Power: Essentially, points to the entire Community, working together to address broad determinants like poverty and education and public infrastructure.

569
01:23:52,530 --> 01:24:00,930
Laura Power: And that that theme is repeated in these public health pre planned communities and it's given me frankly a lot of not just hope that excitement about.

570
01:24:00,930 --> 01:24:14,100
Laura Power: Public health being back, and you know sort of back as the convener of stature and being able to have to have these really important conversations that I think you're going to put the trajectory of life expectancy well being back on the right track.

571
01:24:14,100 --> 01:24:25,320
Laura Power: So one of CDC is always most important partners is a state local health departments and many of our grand rounds audience work in those kind of settings.

572
01:24:25,320 --> 01:24:34,590
Laura Power: What does this idea of public health 3.0 what does or What could it mean for them in their day to day work in life.

573
01:24:34,590 --> 01:24:42,840
Laura Power: You know, in that that we put out a report on public health 3.0 that's available at healthy people.gov healthy people 2020 dot gov.

574
01:24:42,840 --> 01:24:50,280
Laura Power: So if people want to get more into the weeds about it, we make five recommendations essentially about what success looks like and.

575
01:24:50,280 --> 01:25:03,180
Laura Power: Then hanging off of those are another 46 recommendations there's 51 and all but really five big ones about leadership and funding and data and accreditation and accountability and partnerships.

576
01:25:03,180 --> 01:25:12,450
Laura Power: And then ways that federal state and local government, but also the private sector can work together to create the kind of environment that allows them to be successful, what I.

577
01:25:12,450 --> 01:25:22,230
Laura Power: heard in the listening tour, we did about public health 3.0 and what we we have been learning from other sources, particularly people working on this on the front lines.

578
01:25:22,230 --> 01:25:31,560
Laura Power: Is that this is the way they want to work, they want to be able to think broadly about systems and environmental and policy level change, they want to be able to convene and shape.

579
01:25:31,560 --> 01:25:41,700
Laura Power: health in all policies across government sometimes when they're doing that it's short term or it's not sustainable, because the funding they receive tends to be more categorical.

580
01:25:41,700 --> 01:25:47,340
Laura Power: Because they may not have the data or the tools to look at the health of their community broadly.

581
01:25:47,340 --> 01:25:54,150
Laura Power: Maybe they don't have the right partners so maybe business isn't at the table with them as effective ways that as they want.

582
01:25:54,150 --> 01:26:04,350
Laura Power: And, and maybe even as leaders in public health and it doesn't have to be the Health Commissioner or stay health officer Secretary everybody's a leader and public health.

583
01:26:04,350 --> 01:26:13,350
Laura Power: Our education and training experiences having always brought us the vocabulary that gives us that comfort that we can talk with the criminal justice system or transportation or.

584
01:26:13,350 --> 01:26:20,850
Laura Power: The housing sector so it's also incumbent upon those of us working in public health to be to continuously weren't learning and retrain.

585
01:26:20,850 --> 01:26:29,250
Laura Power: To make certain that, when we are having those conversations we can understand the kinds of decisions that now, these other sectors are making and help them.

586
01:26:29,250 --> 01:26:36,630
Laura Power: learn about the the downstream consequences, so I do hope people will look at the report because we took the oops.

587
01:26:36,630 --> 01:26:47,340
Laura Power: Sorry time also to think about what would be most impactful and would begin to bring this new world of public company went out to more communities, but help those that are engaged in it to be successful.

588
01:26:47,340 --> 01:26:52,590
Laura Power: Oh, and there's some case studies so people can learn about communities that are doing it and and learn from them.

589
01:26:52,590 --> 01:27:04,980
Laura Power: So really a vision of a future in which public health has a leadership role, not just in health, but really in improving society in general well being.

590
01:27:04,980 --> 01:27:12,630
Laura Power: And, and to and to, to paraphrase something that we say sometimes and health information technology, the future is here it's just not everywhere.

591
01:27:12,630 --> 01:27:22,110
Laura Power: And so we found that there are a lot of leading edge communities in Kansas, and in spokane Washington and then and then Tennessee and and in the northeast Pennsylvania.

592
01:27:22,110 --> 01:27:35,880
Laura Power: there and they just really need to be supported and to have kind of a framework and be connected to each other, so they can keep learning and growing and advancing the movement.

593
01:27:35,880 --> 01:27:41,280
Laura Power: Just to follow up on that a few concepts, so I thought that was a nice I think she really.

594
01:27:41,280 --> 01:27:45,840
Laura Power: You know that's really the idea of public 3.0 I think it was nicely summarized there.

595
01:27:45,840 --> 01:27:55,050
Laura Power: i'll be kind of help you bring it all together, she talked about the five different ways that there could looks like success in public health 3.0 and so that's really getting it.

596
01:27:55,050 --> 01:28:01,020
Laura Power: These are the core recommendation so having a chief recognizing that public health leaders can.

597
01:28:01,020 --> 01:28:13,170
Laura Power: Have the role of the chief health strategist or there can be some somebody that's serving in that role overseeing wait like how to bring everyone together and the convener and often public health as well, situated to be that.

598
01:28:13,170 --> 01:28:21,150
Laura Power: Really emphasizing cross sector collaboration again that's idea of breaking through the silos and bringing in all the parts thinking about.

599
01:28:21,150 --> 01:28:36,240
Laura Power: You know, health and all policies, thinking about working across with transportation and you know, business and different different groups aren't always traditional public health groups working together on some other things about accreditation and how it's.

600
01:28:36,240 --> 01:28:40,980
Laura Power: The importance of having having the national accreditation.

601
01:28:40,980 --> 01:28:49,320
Laura Power: Thinking about new and non traditional data sources so we tend to have a very traditional surveillance that we do in public health but recognizing the need kind of.

602
01:28:49,320 --> 01:28:58,500
Laura Power: more timely and data that we can act on sometimes even more local local ways of getting data and then always thinking about funding funding is always a challenge for public health.

603
01:28:58,500 --> 01:29:06,780
Laura Power: And so, trying to be hoping to get to leverage different resources or having more innovative ways of finding funding.

604
01:29:06,780 --> 01:29:15,450
Laura Power: The ones I focus on, and I, as you can see i've highlighted one and two, I think those, especially for this class and the concepts of how i'm trying to bring everything together.

605
01:29:15,450 --> 01:29:25,350
Laura Power: is thinking about a strategy understanding the systems understanding that public health is often in that situation to be that, although you can be many different settings you could think of yourself.

606
01:29:25,350 --> 01:29:32,640
Laura Power: You could be in a health care system and strategizing all the different groups that need to come together, I think you can apply this idea in different ways.

607
01:29:32,640 --> 01:29:42,630
Laura Power: And then working across sectors, when we start thinking about leadership, specifically for public health, keep in mind the idea about cross sector collaboration and how we do that.

608
01:29:42,630 --> 01:29:54,300
Laura Power: So, most of them i'm going to point out to be for the sake of time i've kind of got slightly to give you more information about those I am going to just skip through them but they're here.

609
01:29:54,300 --> 01:30:00,600
Laura Power: kind of pointing out the same thing, but just a little more data about those I will point out that.

610
01:30:00,600 --> 01:30:07,290
Laura Power: This idea of achieve health strategists again I think really ties into the idea of leadership and if you're interested about this.

611
01:30:07,290 --> 01:30:14,910
Laura Power: The podcast I gotta linked here and it's also on the additional resources in the day one canvas page, you can listen to a couple.

612
01:30:14,910 --> 01:30:27,030
Laura Power: podcasts about what it means to be the chief strategist and what that looks like, and this, these are just some of the examples here like understanding things in your Community like who are you serving what actually works.

613
01:30:27,030 --> 01:30:38,610
Laura Power: Thinking about non traditional data so that summarized here, but I think it's kind of covered already so i'm going to move us along I going to move us there so.

614
01:30:38,610 --> 01:30:49,290
Laura Power: And I just tried to make the connection that you know, to really get into this idea of public health, three point O cross cutting multi sector vision setting and leadership.

615
01:30:49,290 --> 01:30:58,500
Laura Power: And then building our foundational strategic high performance skills family, maybe that's a better word high performance skills, instead of soft skills.

616
01:30:58,500 --> 01:30:59,550
Sammie Lyons (she/her): like it.

617
01:30:59,550 --> 01:31:05,070
Laura Power: Better right see I forgot I had in this slide here, so there we go I should start using that word.

618
01:31:05,070 --> 01:31:11,340
Laura Power: And then you know really I did transition transitioning from individually focus to collectively focused leadership.

619
01:31:11,340 --> 01:31:27,270
Laura Power: That may be something that's really important for help us towards this public health 3.0 journey, so I kind of enjoyed that thought because that's how i'm trying to bring this all together public health 3.0 collective leadership and thinking about leadership for public health.

620
01:31:27,270 --> 01:31:37,860
Laura Power: This gets into some of the strategies and the strategic skills and so again just to answer those forget the soft skills, the pipe performance skills.

621
01:31:37,860 --> 01:31:50,370
Laura Power: or or call strategic skills so sometimes people call us the public health T where you know many of you are experts in epidemiology or maternal child health, so you are experts in that.

622
01:31:50,370 --> 01:31:58,050
Laura Power: Or you know studying health behavior health education, so you have very specialized skills and whatever you know, whatever your areas are.

623
01:31:58,050 --> 01:32:09,930
Laura Power: But these strategic skills are important for all of us, and these include systems thinking change management persuasive communication problem solving policy engagement.

624
01:32:09,930 --> 01:32:15,180
Laura Power: And I think when you think about good leaders you're going to think about some of these strategic skills.

625
01:32:15,180 --> 01:32:23,640
Laura Power: This resources from the development foundation it's also linked on your canvas page, this also has been updated recently so they've updated the public health.

626
01:32:23,640 --> 01:32:30,000
Laura Power: team, I was when I saw this I said, well, we better have the tea there because I like the idea of the tea the tea the tea still stands.

627
01:32:30,000 --> 01:32:36,990
Laura Power: I think what they did is try to align their words of strategic skills and core competencies of different agencies that have also described.

628
01:32:36,990 --> 01:32:55,470
Laura Power: Core competencies and foundational skills of public health, but the idea still fans that you know we need strategic skills in our public health core competencies all of these are important, in addition to our very specialized skill and, whatever your area of focus is going to be.

629
01:32:55,470 --> 01:33:03,960
Laura Power: So all right, so what now it is let's see the 305 so we're doing Okay, actually, so what i'm going to do is.

630
01:33:03,960 --> 01:33:23,910
Laura Power: leave you to do this on your own for a minute and also will also bring building a break, so if you go to your canvas page you see there's a if you're on if you click on day one, then you'll see the link to leadership brainstorm so first let's make sure you're all finding your way there.

631
01:33:23,910 --> 01:33:30,480
Laura Power: Everybody see what i'm talking about.

632
01:33:30,480 --> 01:33:33,390
Laura Power: Okay guys see me thumbs up, thank you, Lady.

633
01:33:33,390 --> 01:33:35,760
Yolaine A Civil: Is it under assignments.

634
01:33:35,760 --> 01:33:50,490
Laura Power: Now it does get there, too, but also if you actually let me, let me just stop my share real quick oops I meant to hold on and did it backwards, I meant to go to my canvas page and show you that.

635
01:33:50,490 --> 01:33:57,420
Just make sure you're all getting there.

636
01:33:57,420 --> 01:34:05,220
Laura Power: Okay, let me just navigate with you so i'm on the main page I go to day one.

637
01:34:05,220 --> 01:34:09,060
Laura Power: And then, if you click here leadership brainstorm.

638
01:34:09,060 --> 01:34:19,800
Laura Power: You can also, I think, if you can get two assignments you're also just so we're looking at it together, you can also get there through assignment tab because you'll see this as one of the assignments.

639
01:34:19,800 --> 01:34:30,780
Laura Power: But i've tried to make it so that you can find everything you need for the classes just on the date page that you're on so day one, my slides are here, if you hadn't found them, yet the slides i'm using are here.

640
01:34:30,780 --> 01:34:42,840
Laura Power: And here's my son agenda, although you know give or take I put the time they're just so i'm organized, but you know we'll go we'll figure it out as we go time wise, because I know him over already.

641
01:34:42,840 --> 01:34:48,780
Laura Power: So what I want you to do next, is just do this and then also take a break.

642
01:34:48,780 --> 01:35:02,610
Laura Power: Oh good look at that you guys are already doing it excellent so first you'll click on this Google form and you'll get to this just just define what you think a good leader is it just a one in one or two sentences define what it means to be a leader.

643
01:35:02,610 --> 01:35:14,520
Laura Power: And then also word garden, because who doesn't love, a word garden i'm using the answer garden link, so you can click on this and you can go ahead and put some of those in there.

644
01:35:14,520 --> 01:35:30,990
Laura Power: So why don't you do that, and then also take time for a break and then after let's see give you what, if you do that, and we come back around.

645
01:35:30,990 --> 01:35:36,120
Laura Power: Around 330 is that enough time to do this and for a break.

646
01:35:36,120 --> 01:35:49,560
Laura Power: Okay, so 330 then when we come back we'll debrief on this a little bit i'll do a little bit more lecture about general leadership stuff and that will lead into the last thing, which is an assignment which you'll have time to work on.

647
01:35:49,560 --> 01:36:05,220
Laura Power: So i'll hang out here, in case you have questions for a minute then i'll probably take a break to please go ahead and work on this go take your break and i'll see you at what did I say 330 right 333 30.

648
01:36:05,220 --> 01:36:36,960
Laura Power: i'll hang out here, if you have a couple if you have questions in the meantime.

649
01:36:36,960 --> 01:36:42,030
Laura Power: Thanks josh I turned it off, I forgot to turn it on.

650
01:36:42,030 --> 01:36:48,750
Laura Power: So we're thinking about the definition of leadership, you know you have given some very nice definitions here, so I just wanted to.

651
01:36:48,750 --> 01:36:58,440
Laura Power: share them here there's some more there was two pages does anybody want to comment as they thought through this was this something obvious to you.

652
01:36:58,440 --> 01:37:13,170
Laura Power: Did you have a clear idea of what it means to be a leader once you guys reflect for a minute and the definitions and kind of me coming to my MIC oh.

653
01:37:13,170 --> 01:37:23,910
Quintin Solano: You know one thing I thought about and I put in my description to more recently over the last couple of years is like this concept of being a good follower before being a good leader.

654
01:37:23,910 --> 01:37:29,220
Quintin Solano: And it sounds like counterintuitive it's like leading you know you're always told be a leader, not a follower.

655
01:37:29,220 --> 01:37:33,870
Quintin Solano: But when coming on to a new team oftentimes leaders can be placed with people that never worked with before.

656
01:37:33,870 --> 01:37:39,840
Quintin Solano: And oftentimes TEAM members can feel like things are going good, why are we changing anything, why do we have a new leader.

657
01:37:39,840 --> 01:37:43,260
Quintin Solano: And a leader comes in, you could imagine if you're a teammate and.

658
01:37:43,260 --> 01:37:53,490
Quintin Solano: They just start changing things and you don't feel like they have a good idea of how things work, you might be a little bit more resistant, or you might just say why is this guy kind of Boston us around or female boss us around.

659
01:37:53,490 --> 01:38:02,430
Quintin Solano: And so I always think of like being a good follower first because it doesn't exactly come naturally to him for me to think that of like coming onto a team.

660
01:38:02,430 --> 01:38:13,440
Quintin Solano: And really getting an idea for how things kind of run with that team, and how are they doing things currently and then you know after you get to know your teammates get to know people and how things are done how that job is done.

661
01:38:13,440 --> 01:38:21,090
Quintin Solano: Then you can start maybe instituting some things with an outside perspective to improve the workflow or whatever it is that you're doing.

662
01:38:21,090 --> 01:38:22,260
Laura Power: A great perspective I.

663
01:38:22,260 --> 01:38:25,500
Michael-Ryan Lowe: Think it's interesting totally agree with Quinn i'm sorry.

664
01:38:25,500 --> 01:38:27,120
Laura Power: Please, please go ahead.

665
01:38:27,120 --> 01:38:36,720
Michael-Ryan Lowe: I totally agree with when I kind of look at it and aspect of like you know, a team like let's say we can look at a sports team, or something like that let's look at football.

666
01:38:36,720 --> 01:38:41,850
Michael-Ryan Lowe: um you know, everybody on that team has a specific role and a specific job that they need to do.

667
01:38:41,850 --> 01:38:49,350
Michael-Ryan Lowe: And they all work individually in order to come together as a unit to execute that job, so I kind of look at leadership that way to you know.

668
01:38:49,350 --> 01:38:54,990
Michael-Ryan Lowe: On the quarterback job is to do the quarterback things like throw the ball, you know.

669
01:38:54,990 --> 01:39:03,390
Michael-Ryan Lowe: know all the plays know how to recognize defensive things like that, whereas the running back job his job is to run the ball catch passes or different things of that nature.

670
01:39:03,390 --> 01:39:11,670
Michael-Ryan Lowe: And I feel like you know when you enter into a new environment similar to like what Glenn was saying you just have to know how to facilitate your role on that team.

671
01:39:11,670 --> 01:39:24,120
Michael-Ryan Lowe: and your role of the final itself, but as long as you're doing your part, you guys will all work together as a unit and execute properly, but sooner, so one you know tries to do someone else's job or they don't.

672
01:39:24,120 --> 01:39:30,330
Michael-Ryan Lowe: follow through on their job that's when things start to fall apart now, there will be opportunities, where like you know.

673
01:39:30,330 --> 01:39:35,190
Michael-Ryan Lowe: Each individual can step out of facilitate and take the lead role.

674
01:39:35,190 --> 01:39:41,460
Michael-Ryan Lowe: You know, say, for example, you know the quarterback doesn't score all the tests now sometimes he gives the ball to the running back and he runs it for testing.

675
01:39:41,460 --> 01:39:50,010
Michael-Ryan Lowe: or sometime that defensive back and assess the ball and texting it for a touchdown you see so it's moments at different times when people can.

676
01:39:50,010 --> 01:39:59,370
Michael-Ryan Lowe: come forward and take for leadership, but the goal is to do your job, and not a pleasant.

677
01:39:59,370 --> 01:40:02,100
Great Thank you.

678
01:40:02,100 --> 01:40:06,630
Laura Power: Any other comments or reflections on him.

679
01:40:06,630 --> 01:40:08,940
Erin Thompson: I have one.

680
01:40:08,940 --> 01:40:16,470
Erin Thompson: For me, I highlighted the importance of integrity, for me, I think a leader is someone who.

681
01:40:16,470 --> 01:40:24,210
Erin Thompson: You know they do what they say and I do they I mean they do that, they say what they mean, and they also like.

682
01:40:24,210 --> 01:40:26,490
Erin Thompson: I guess.

683
01:40:26,490 --> 01:40:35,190
Erin Thompson: Practice what they preach basically um and you know if they say they're going to do something they can be trusted to do that, that thing and they won't you know.

684
01:40:35,190 --> 01:40:46,980
Erin Thompson: tell you to do something and then go do something, you know completely know contradictory themselves it's also good to pull others up with you so to foster leadership and others and.

685
01:40:46,980 --> 01:40:57,900
Erin Thompson: Like you are a leader, but you don't put others down, while you know leading them, you also help them to grow in their leadership skills as well.

686
01:40:57,900 --> 01:41:08,700
Laura Power: I think that's one thing that my the woman, I referred to in the beginning, I think she does that to air, and I think that's she's helped me a lot and I think she did that.

687
01:41:08,700 --> 01:41:11,220
Aliyah Abdul-Wakil: hey this is aaliyah.

688
01:41:11,220 --> 01:41:26,760
Aliyah Abdul-Wakil: What I love about this is that it takes it out of the perspective of a group, like you, don't need to be on a team and a team to be a great leader and i've never thought.

689
01:41:26,760 --> 01:41:32,400
Aliyah Abdul-Wakil: About a leader in this way and to me it really.

690
01:41:32,400 --> 01:41:53,550
Aliyah Abdul-Wakil: makes me think of how it starts with myself and how do I lead my own life and how am I, putting my best forward my best foot forward for myself and like holding myself accountable and I and i've never thought about it this way and it's like who are you and no one's watching like um.

691
01:41:53,550 --> 01:42:00,750
Aliyah Abdul-Wakil: And it's just kind of things that that start with with ourselves and things that we can work on.

692
01:42:00,750 --> 01:42:11,340
Aliyah Abdul-Wakil: Like internally and then hopefully by doing that, we have something that we can share with others, so i've never thought about it this way, and I really like that yeah that's great.

693
01:42:11,340 --> 01:42:12,480
Laura Power: Thank you for sharing that.

694
01:42:12,480 --> 01:42:24,030
Laura Power: And I think it is interesting to thinking of all the different capacities and ways because, being a leader really is it means a lot of different things, and it can depend on when and where and.

695
01:42:24,030 --> 01:42:27,150
Laura Power: yeah personal leadership taking charge of your own.

696
01:42:27,150 --> 01:42:35,250
Laura Power: You know and we'll kind of get to this later in the week, which is thinking about your own vision and like, how do you get to where you want to be that's that's personal that's kind of inside.

697
01:42:35,250 --> 01:42:43,110
Laura Power: And then, sometimes sometimes hopefully those characteristics will exude out to you know, help us lead groups as well, but sometimes we are in a formal.

698
01:42:43,110 --> 01:42:54,840
Laura Power: structure or a group or a team where where we may have a formal leadership role, or we just sort of naturally personality wise and whatnot kind of lead in a certain way.

699
01:42:54,840 --> 01:43:01,890
Laura Power: So that's interesting, I think you guys all have a very it's an open mind, of how to think about what leadership is.

700
01:43:01,890 --> 01:43:12,930
Laura Power: Sometimes we will hear people talk about their you know very structured authoritative like what is a leader and I appreciate cues comment in the beginning about.

701
01:43:12,930 --> 01:43:23,100
Laura Power: Being a good follower too, because I think sometimes we think like being a leader reset associated positive and maybe a follower of your described as a file, or sometimes.

702
01:43:23,100 --> 01:43:30,600
Laura Power: Sometimes there's maybe a negative connotation, with it, and that that there, but I think I think you really both pointed out of Michael Ryan Q about.

703
01:43:30,600 --> 01:43:38,760
Laura Power: Why it's important to be a follower or a member of a team and recognizing the Leader structure and trying to understand what's going on, so.

704
01:43:38,760 --> 01:43:42,150
Laura Power: very insightful comments.

705
01:43:42,150 --> 01:43:48,600
Laura Power: All right, well, I appreciate that i've put these here just for you to kind of reflect on and see how people.

706
01:43:48,600 --> 01:44:02,760
Laura Power: Think about leaders, but I think what stands out to me, and when i've done this before, too, is really just you know thinking about how we're nurturing people how we're moving people forward having a vision.

707
01:44:02,760 --> 01:44:22,050
Laura Power: that's where a lot of it comes around like resilience and bringing people along with them, and we are bringing their team along and transformative qualities so so a lot of different ways to be a leader i'm just to go through a couple concepts here.

708
01:44:22,050 --> 01:44:32,490
Laura Power: You know, we talked about being a leader, and I think was it was an error and maybe you said this about manager versus a leader yeah okay good.

709
01:44:32,490 --> 01:44:40,470
Laura Power: Sure, I remember, but so there are different way, you know and it's it's important to be to have both of these skills, depending on what in where you're what you're doing but.

710
01:44:40,470 --> 01:44:48,030
Laura Power: There is a slight difference between what it means to be a leader and having leadership skills versus what it means to be a manager and having manager skills.

711
01:44:48,030 --> 01:44:57,030
Laura Power: They do definitely overlap at times for sure and there's things that will help both of them, but you can think about them, sometimes in a different way.

712
01:44:57,030 --> 01:45:05,460
Laura Power: The other thing too is just that sometimes sometimes when we think of a leader is a position that we may hold there may be a position.

713
01:45:05,460 --> 01:45:11,550
Laura Power: Of sort of an authoritative position you know the dean of the school, the President of a company, you know.

714
01:45:11,550 --> 01:45:21,510
Laura Power: The teacher and leading the class like there's different ways, where we have a certain responsibilities that we have and roles that we are to fill but.

715
01:45:21,510 --> 01:45:33,900
Laura Power: Often, people will also say you know, sometimes you know, having an authority position doesn't automatically make you a good leader, you might be officially, the leader of the team, but you can think about what it means to.

716
01:45:33,900 --> 01:45:42,570
Laura Power: To be in a leadership position and what it means to be a leader, and you can still lead, even if you don't have formal leadership.

717
01:45:42,570 --> 01:45:45,630
Laura Power: A formal leadership position.

718
01:45:45,630 --> 01:45:56,070
Laura Power: So just real quick kind of just some theory about leadership is thinking about how people become good leaders because that's one thing we want to learn and talk about in this class so.

719
01:45:56,070 --> 01:46:08,790
Laura Power: there's some theories about you know how do you how are leaders need are they born if people are people born natural leaders, I mean sometimes you hear that describe and you talk about your person is a natural leader.

720
01:46:08,790 --> 01:46:19,200
Laura Power: or something about them they're just the way they are, they were born that way, or maybe maybe they were made because of what they've learned along the way in the skills they've acquired so think about that.

721
01:46:19,200 --> 01:46:30,480
Laura Power: I know you're all wanting to learn more about leadership and i've been learning a lot, you know, and I continue to learn so i'm hoping you're not just born and hoping, their main well let's see what some of the theories say.

722
01:46:30,480 --> 01:46:39,690
Laura Power: there's lots of different theories and I am not i'm not an expert in all the leadership theories, but if you've maybe some of you, I know, done some reading about this.

723
01:46:39,690 --> 01:46:49,080
Laura Power: there's different theories out there about like how people become good leaders and just to go through a couple of them, this is definitely an older one the great man theory.

724
01:46:49,080 --> 01:47:00,270
Laura Power: And it's very it says leaders are born you're just you're born a leader, you were almost ordained to become a leader it's very mythical and valiant and.

725
01:47:00,270 --> 01:47:07,230
Laura Power: it's just an inherent ability that you have and almost a right, you can see that this is a definitely an older concept.

726
01:47:07,230 --> 01:47:18,120
Laura Power: But it's saying that just something about you, you were born to be a leader and some people are not born to be leaders and that's just the way it is so that's what this theory says definitely older one.

727
01:47:18,120 --> 01:47:25,980
Laura Power: The contingency theory it says that some people will be good leaders, but it depends on the situation and it depends on their their leadership style.

728
01:47:25,980 --> 01:47:36,600
Laura Power: So you know my leadership style might work well in a certain situation, but it may be doesn't work so well and another, and it doesn't really allow for as much flexibility, like, I just have a certain way.

729
01:47:36,600 --> 01:47:52,830
Laura Power: And it works well in this way, but it doesn't, allow me to to shift my leadership style it's just something that you know you serve you happen to have it in your in the kind of in the right place at the right time, with your personality traits and things like that.

730
01:47:52,830 --> 01:48:06,090
Laura Power: It does recognize that there are many different variables that contribute to successful leadership and basically you know it's according to the theory, you can be an effective leader in one circumstance, but not maybe not so effective and another.

731
01:48:06,090 --> 01:48:15,210
Laura Power: Then there's a situational theory which is similar to that, but it allows for us to to have different styles, depending on the situation so.

732
01:48:15,210 --> 01:48:30,600
Laura Power: kind of similar to the last one, no one style is applicable to all situations, but people are actually able to assess and realize like okay here, I need to have more authoritative top down approach okay now this situation, I need to be it's helpful to be.

733
01:48:30,600 --> 01:48:40,770
Laura Power: You know more like understanding what everyone's thinking and bringing everybody in so you know it just depends on the situation.

734
01:48:40,770 --> 01:48:50,370
Laura Power: A little bit different from the last two is the behavioral theory which is saying that it's just about how people behave and really it can be learned by anybody So if you.

735
01:48:50,370 --> 01:48:58,560
Laura Power: Think of those who are role models that you all mentioned, maybe there are things that you can learn from them, and you can emulate yourself, and you can then be a good leader as well.

736
01:48:58,560 --> 01:49:06,180
Laura Power: So it's really saying that leaders are born, but they are created by the behaviors that they've learned along the way.

737
01:49:06,180 --> 01:49:19,650
Laura Power: So I like to think that you know I tend to agree with, especially the lasting situational and the the behavior one that we can learn these things and that's why we're all studying and we certainly do and i'm sure.

738
01:49:19,650 --> 01:49:32,550
Laura Power: As you reflect back in your own professional and personal journey, as you probably can look back and you know things you do now that you maybe didn't know how to do and handle certain situations before so.

739
01:49:32,550 --> 01:49:40,710
Laura Power: Just something to think about other thing that people talk about when they talk about leadership are different styles and different traits and we'll.

740
01:49:40,710 --> 01:49:51,240
Laura Power: go through those a little bit, but different styles or style is the method and theories that people use to just make you know get through their decisions and how to manage and so.

741
01:49:51,240 --> 01:50:04,500
Laura Power: it's just the way we tend to be a lead is the file that we have and we'll go through a couple examples trades are really kind of inherent to the person they're the traits that you hold their your trades.

742
01:50:04,500 --> 01:50:08,880
Laura Power: or strength that you have, and you can build on that, but we all have different.

743
01:50:08,880 --> 01:50:22,320
Laura Power: You know personality traits and just treats about ourselves, it might stand out and some that might help us to lead in certain situations and others that might help us in different situations so leadership style and leadership traits.

744
01:50:22,320 --> 01:50:35,520
Laura Power: So thinking about leadership styles again it's how we it's the way that we use any power or authority or influence or other things that we can have to help lead and move others along towards a common goal.

745
01:50:35,520 --> 01:50:47,700
Laura Power: We all tend to have a style that comes naturally to us so it's just our kind of default style it's what we feel most comfortable kind of meshes with your personality and that's how you tend to lead.

746
01:50:47,700 --> 01:50:55,860
Laura Power: Many will say that a good leader can adjust their leadership style to the situation so even though maybe i'm more comfortable in the.

747
01:50:55,860 --> 01:51:02,730
Laura Power: Democratic you know let's get everyone's idea and think about it, and then i'll make my decision that might be my comfort zone.

748
01:51:02,730 --> 01:51:14,610
Laura Power: But there are times when really I need to be authoritative and just make the decision based on the information that I have so hopefully people can adjust their style as needed.

749
01:51:14,610 --> 01:51:21,210
Laura Power: there's a lot of different ways of describing leadership styles and, especially, you know, Kate and I think.

750
01:51:21,210 --> 01:51:29,910
Laura Power: Q, I think it was who also Q, you had done a lot of reading to just thinking about different leadership styles, if you and then.

751
01:51:29,910 --> 01:51:39,150
Laura Power: You know, welcome you or others to just comment on this, but there's different schools of thought, and I think you can find all kinds of gurus like leadership gurus that will.

752
01:51:39,150 --> 01:51:48,870
Laura Power: describe all these leadership styles, so I put a coffee no I just put a listing of some here but there's many different ways to describe leadership and they'll be even more tomorrow we'll talk about that.

753
01:51:48,870 --> 01:52:11,490
Laura Power: I think, are more specific and important for us in the public health setting but here's a few of them and we'll talk about just a few of them here for any comments so i'll just i'll just stop real quick to see if there's income.

754
01:52:11,490 --> 01:52:18,570
Laura Power: All right, so just to go through a few of the types of leadership, these are kind of kind of basic ones that are often mentioned.

755
01:52:18,570 --> 01:52:32,640
Laura Power: The autocratic leader, so this is the leader who you know it's kind of a top down approach that all the decisions, I really made with the leader, not necessarily with consulting others and the team executes a.

756
01:52:32,640 --> 01:52:42,930
Laura Power: leader says team goes done this can be, and this is important and needed some time, so you know, I think, with all these styles, are these leadership style sometimes there's like.

757
01:52:42,930 --> 01:52:56,910
Laura Power: connotations with them, but really all of these it just depends on the situation, I think, so an autocratic style is helpful and when it's fast, you know you can get things done quickly and.

758
01:52:56,910 --> 01:53:03,720
Laura Power: sort of this idea that the leader is what kind of watching the boss is watching so people might feel motivated to perform and get things done.

759
01:53:03,720 --> 01:53:13,500
Laura Power: it's not a stress, for me, for the rest of the teams and supposedly because the leaders and want taking all the responsibility on the decisions it's kind of a buck stops there with that person.

760
01:53:13,500 --> 01:53:21,630
Laura Power: But it can be maybe frustrating, you know, maybe you don't understand why things are happening or why you're being asked to do certain things you're doing or.

761
01:53:21,630 --> 01:53:28,500
Laura Power: There could be resentment, maybe towards a leader or or if the Leader wasn't there, maybe the organization of the group.

762
01:53:28,500 --> 01:53:38,190
Laura Power: can't really function without that one leader, it was like the one person that was always doing things and always making the decisions, what if they're not there, you know, will there be plans beyond that.

763
01:53:38,190 --> 01:53:46,380
Laura Power: And there could be communication breakdowns that occur, so this is one kind of top down leadership, you can probably think of examples of that.

764
01:53:46,380 --> 01:53:53,940
Laura Power: I think, a very common style that we tend to see is the democratic or off sometimes called participants of leadership.

765
01:53:53,940 --> 01:54:02,130
Laura Power: Where this is really more like team based there's you know shared decision making lots of ideas open discussion the Leader does ultimately.

766
01:54:02,130 --> 01:54:19,500
Laura Power: make the decision, if it is like a formal leadership or something but it's based on input so there's definitely advantages of that where you're getting lots of input so maybe by having lots of input, you might have less risk for having a really bad failure.

767
01:54:19,500 --> 01:54:28,470
Laura Power: it's often thought that this promotes a good working environment and having high performance teams, because many people are involved, it can be very slow.

768
01:54:28,470 --> 01:54:37,620
Laura Power: I know I think I tend to be this way and I like to get everyone's ideas and I like to like to marinate around in my brain before I finally make my decision and.

769
01:54:37,620 --> 01:54:45,630
Laura Power: That can be slow so sometimes I gotta like move it along you could be overly dependent on a team like maybe the leader is really you know.

770
01:54:45,630 --> 01:54:57,510
Laura Power: needs everyone else's opinion or ideas or input, before going forward and sometimes it can kind of drift like if that strong leader is not there, setting the direction, then.

771
01:54:57,510 --> 01:55:03,690
Laura Power: Maybe you know, maybe kind of drift off from the goal, and yes collaborative burden and thank you.

772
01:55:03,690 --> 01:55:20,490
Laura Power: Thank you Sammy for pointing that out, and I think that's an interesting one to think about right, this is like everyone having to come together and maybe we can all remember times when we've had a collaborative burden, maybe even just a project you've worked on, or something like that.

773
01:55:20,490 --> 01:55:29,670
Laura Power: was a fair leadership is very hands off LEADER I can think of a leader, that I work with who's often described as being very hands off.

774
01:55:29,670 --> 01:55:38,760
Laura Power: And I feel like sometimes if someone gets a kind of a negative connotation, however, there are times when I do think it is important and good tab.

775
01:55:38,760 --> 01:55:46,650
Laura Power: I think that you need to know your team and know that when you can when you can be the handoff leader, if you have a very strong team.

776
01:55:46,650 --> 01:55:57,600
Laura Power: you're helping to your call cultivate personal responsibility motivated TEAM members, they can kind of figure that kind of problem solve on their own and they're able to get things going.

777
01:55:57,600 --> 01:56:06,750
Laura Power: And for people who are motivated and like this method, then you know you can have higher retention and faster growth like Aaron is saying.

778
01:56:06,750 --> 01:56:14,370
Laura Power: So I think there's there are some good things about this, it can be hard, I think, definitely depending on the team sometimes or.

779
01:56:14,370 --> 01:56:24,060
Laura Power: Maybe if the leader is hands off and also not you know the organization or the structure or whatever is not supportive enough to the TEAM members.

780
01:56:24,060 --> 01:56:33,510
Laura Power: Then, maybe that can be very stressful maybe there can be issues with accountability if people aren't really paying attention, or maybe there's mistakes and things like that that might happen to so having some.

781
01:56:33,510 --> 01:56:46,830
Laura Power: structure in place to you know figure out when laissez faire might be the right approach, but making sure, maybe there's checks and balances somewhere to kind of make sure people are getting what they need to.

782
01:56:46,830 --> 01:56:52,500
Laura Power: And then one more than the transformational leadership, where this is sort of that like.

783
01:56:52,500 --> 01:57:03,150
Laura Power: You know the the the visionary person, the one that's really setting you know it's like the role model for the bank behavior and has very high expectations and.

784
01:57:03,150 --> 01:57:10,320
Laura Power: really gets the values out there and, as you know, has integrity and build strong coalition's and sort of that like.

785
01:57:10,320 --> 01:57:18,960
Laura Power: Trying to think of a better word than transformative itself, but the person that is really you know motivating others to change, I guess that's kind of what I think i've sometimes.

786
01:57:18,960 --> 01:57:25,410
Laura Power: I feel this one is often thought of as other that ultimate leader that you're trying to be, but you know this.

787
01:57:25,410 --> 01:57:31,560
Laura Power: There is a right time and place for this, but there are times when you need all the other styles we've talked about to.

788
01:57:31,560 --> 01:57:44,850
Laura Power: This one you can really think about short and really focus also on long term goals, often the leader is, you know very trusted and people feel supported and there's good communication, but sometimes it can be.

789
01:57:44,850 --> 01:57:50,490
Laura Power: You know, takes a lot of time like you're you're you're trying to get to a vision, but how do you get there, how do you build trust.

790
01:57:50,490 --> 01:57:58,890
Laura Power: And maybe this might be i'm sure we've all described people we worked with whoever like very big picture thinkers but maybe not not into the day to day details and.

791
01:57:58,890 --> 01:58:05,610
Laura Power: So me, you know, maybe, hands off of it, but you know so motivating so that could be challenging sometimes where.

792
01:58:05,610 --> 01:58:14,640
Laura Power: Are not detail oriented, and maybe like the implementation can get lost sometimes so you know they all have pros and cons advantages and disadvantages and.

793
01:58:14,640 --> 01:58:25,380
Laura Power: You know there's also different situations when the styles are needed and again there's many other styles there's many different ways to describe leadership styles we'll talk.

794
01:58:25,380 --> 01:58:37,890
Laura Power: Tomorrow, a little bit more about different types I purposely left those to move them into the public health leadership discussion tomorrow but you'll see that there are some described styles at tend to.

795
01:58:37,890 --> 01:58:46,890
Laura Power: Especially in the public are 3.0 concept, I think mesh with that so The other thing is the leadership traits so we talked about styles and there's treats.

796
01:58:46,890 --> 01:58:54,150
Laura Power: And you know there's lots of different ways that we can think about trades and again there's lots of different gurus and different you know.

797
01:58:54,150 --> 01:59:02,760
Laura Power: think tanks about what it means to have, what are the leadership traits and there's just so many of them, so I have some here, these Actually, I think.

798
01:59:02,760 --> 01:59:15,060
Laura Power: I kind of liked I don't know this one, I just have so I caught it so kind of like the integrity vision self awareness decisiveness collaboration here's some others what.

799
01:59:15,060 --> 01:59:24,960
Laura Power: I think that your words also were very nice here too, so again i'll just pause and let let you all reflect on this together.

800
01:59:24,960 --> 01:59:52,260
Laura Power: And if you can think of other words, it should be in here, but it looks like compassion confidence honesty understanding the role on the team as a follower being having good communication speaking skills, those are really big ones.

801
01:59:52,260 --> 01:59:57,360
Laura Power: says look like a comprehensive list you anything else you would want to.

802
01:59:57,360 --> 02:00:01,980
Laura Power: and

803
02:00:01,980 --> 02:00:19,260
Laura Power: This one to me, I sometimes when i've done this sometimes vision will be the really big one So how do I know just like you know, maybe just to have the same word probably makes a big in this one, but sometimes sometimes vision really stands out I like ethical having that in here.

804
02:00:19,260 --> 02:00:24,240
dynamic.

805
02:00:24,240 --> 02:00:31,260
adaptable, unbiased.

806
02:00:31,260 --> 02:00:42,630
Sammie Lyons (she/her): I am I didn't I think I wrote it in the description, but I wanted to also add like willing to make hard decisions I when I look at these words.

807
02:00:42,630 --> 02:00:58,230
Sammie Lyons (she/her): they're all kind of comfortable in a way, and I think leaders need to be able to rest in that hard spot where they need it, make a decision, where they feel it's going to.

808
02:00:58,230 --> 02:01:07,980
Sammie Lyons (she/her): advance the group, even if they're meeting a lot of different resistance resistance from different people, and I think that can be very tough space mm hmm.

809
02:01:07,980 --> 02:01:09,930
Laura Power: a really good point.

810
02:01:09,930 --> 02:01:12,690
cuz I.

811
02:01:12,690 --> 02:01:29,220
Victoria Walker: know, I was going to agree with Sammy I was thinking, one of the things we don't have like somebody who's not conflict adverse that they can lean into the conflict, sometimes, and they can sit in that thickness and that heaviness of the uncomfortable feelings so.

812
02:01:29,220 --> 02:01:34,230
Laura Power: really good when you bring out.

813
02:01:34,230 --> 02:01:41,250
Yolaine A Civil: I was gonna say I wrote down courageous and it didn't end up there, but I think that goes in line with what they were saying.

814
02:01:41,250 --> 02:01:55,200
Yolaine A Civil: Because there are times when you're a leader if something's not right and everyone else is just kind of going along with it and afraid to say something, you have to be able to stand up and say you know this is some right, even if you're the only one saying.

815
02:01:55,200 --> 02:02:04,680
Laura Power: that's a good way to encompass it sorry my mind is copied this before I got your word in there you'll be like i'm glad you mentioned that that's a nice way, I think, to to.

816
02:02:04,680 --> 02:02:07,830
Laura Power: To say it it's a nice word to be courageous.

817
02:02:07,830 --> 02:02:19,320
Laura Power: But I think in Victoria and Sam you are saying and what you're doing is helping us to see here, too, is that yeah it's it's not doesn't always feel nice, but it needs to be done.

818
02:02:19,320 --> 02:02:25,950
Ahya Sajawal Ali: And I would like to add to the same idea that I would want them to be persistent.

819
02:02:25,950 --> 02:02:43,890
Ahya Sajawal Ali: Sometimes hard choices have to be made persistently over time and things are don't automatically see the the the Nice picture very quickly so persisting through that difficult time is really important to.

820
02:02:43,890 --> 02:02:44,670
Laura Power: You and I think.

821
02:02:44,670 --> 02:02:54,450
Laura Power: I was I knew I this word, of course I knew the answer garden was coming and when josh talked about factor phone to just say it again here, I feel like energy.

822
02:02:54,450 --> 02:03:05,040
Laura Power: Like resilience and endurance is sometimes sometimes needed, you know I guess depending on what's going on.

823
02:03:05,040 --> 02:03:18,330
Laura Power: Okay, good I always enjoy kind of hearing, I think, hearing how people think about this this helps us to think about what is important to us in our own, you know as a leader ourselves, and when we look to other people.

824
02:03:18,330 --> 02:03:24,150
Laura Power: And there's a lot of different ways that we can think about that, so thank you for that.

825
02:03:24,150 --> 02:03:34,380
Laura Power: i'll point out this these next slides are kind of just reflecting on some of the traits that were mentioned, and I just pulled out a few that I think are important to reflect on.

826
02:03:34,380 --> 02:03:42,780
Laura Power: One that doesn't often get mentioned, but I do think is important is really just understanding like kind of like emotional intelligence like.

827
02:03:42,780 --> 02:03:54,420
Laura Power: Understanding yourself and also be able to figure other people out so knowing what your own values are and your own beliefs, you know, having that insight I think is important.

828
02:03:54,420 --> 02:04:04,770
Laura Power: Understanding stakeholders and being able to build strong relationships so really those concepts of emotional intelligence, being aware of.

829
02:04:04,770 --> 02:04:18,600
Laura Power: Your own emotions to and how you handle difficult situations so being able to get through those really uncomfortable or difficult decisions and so knowing how you operate in that I think that's an important one.

830
02:04:18,600 --> 02:04:23,640
Laura Power: And some of these are often thought of as important in leadership is really.

831
02:04:23,640 --> 02:04:30,780
Laura Power: You know, having again that that emotional intelligence, so your IQ and your eq you know so it's some of its.

832
02:04:30,780 --> 02:04:36,900
Laura Power: Knowledge and decision making, but some of it's also just really getting at the deeper things like self awareness.

833
02:04:36,900 --> 02:04:50,970
Laura Power: Self management social skills empathy motivation and understand that within yourself and also understanding that outside you know, seeing that figuring that out figuring other people out to some people are really good at that.

834
02:04:50,970 --> 02:04:54,030
Laura Power: Sometimes you know, some people aren't as good.

835
02:04:54,030 --> 02:05:05,850
Laura Power: vision of course of the big one too so often people define a leader many definitions talk about that a leader is someone who helps a group of people towards a certain vision and mission and goal.

836
02:05:05,850 --> 02:05:18,930
Laura Power: So leaders that have a vision and communicated effectively and be able to unite people around this idea so that's something to that is often discussed about meters.

837
02:05:18,930 --> 02:05:22,830
Laura Power: and influence isn't is one interesting I.

838
02:05:22,830 --> 02:05:34,410
Laura Power: I sat through I was on a search committee recently for a larger leadership role at our university that was fascinating was the first search Committee I had been part of I learned a lot from that I will tell you.

839
02:05:34,410 --> 02:05:45,600
Laura Power: So that was like a service that I really learned a ton from and thinking about people having their vision, and you know people were talking about that influence was one thing that people on the search committee were talking about.

840
02:05:45,600 --> 02:05:59,820
Laura Power: Will this person be able to influence the other, you know stakeholders associated with this thing in the university, so how how people have influence, and I think there's something that maybe have.

841
02:05:59,820 --> 02:06:09,960
Laura Power: I don't know, maybe like what am I trying to think of like state our own stereotypical ideas of like who and how people influence, but recognizing that there are many ways that we can have influence.

842
02:06:09,960 --> 02:06:22,440
Laura Power: If you are trying to articulate yourself as a leader, how do you show that you can have influence and show your vision and show your emotional intelligence So those are things to think about to.

843
02:06:22,440 --> 02:06:25,320
Laura Power: effective communication, of course.

844
02:06:25,320 --> 02:06:31,380
Laura Power: I think was mentioned earlier, I think he said that.

845
02:06:31,380 --> 02:06:41,340
Laura Power: That was Anthony right I think Anthony talked about having good public speaking skills and that would be you know helps to build things like trust as well, so having.

846
02:06:41,340 --> 02:06:50,340
Laura Power: The speaking skills can sometimes lead to trust, but also persistent and I immediately think of consistent to if someone's consistent, you know.

847
02:06:50,340 --> 02:07:06,420
Laura Power: You know how they're going to make decisions, you can you can see, it seems like it's reasonable and I don't know, maybe fair as a word to use, but you just see this consistent behavior that people are having integrity and creating positive relationships and consistent in what they do.

848
02:07:06,420 --> 02:07:11,040
Laura Power: Being a good relationship building.

849
02:07:11,040 --> 02:07:22,950
Laura Power: Something that is important as well, one two is being able to make good decisions like what is their decision making capacity and that's a tough one that's like you know how do you.

850
02:07:22,950 --> 02:07:40,800
Laura Power: that's really more about a leaders skills, I think, and we'll talk about strategic and systems thinking skills, but you could say the leaders, a good leader might have strong strategic skills and have strong systems thinking skills.

851
02:07:40,800 --> 02:07:47,730
Laura Power: Okay, so just this just to point out, this is a textbook about public health leadership.

852
02:07:47,730 --> 02:07:56,610
Laura Power: Putting principles into practice, and so this is just what I pulled out from their text that says that's what they think the key leadership skills for public health.

853
02:07:56,610 --> 02:08:13,980
Laura Power: Are you know, identifying the most useful information to use motivating and working with others, taking risks and following through with you all commented on communicating on many different levels and acting as a systems thinker, with an understanding of how complexity effects work.

854
02:08:13,980 --> 02:08:35,190
Laura Power: here's another one so again different gurus and so here's another cruises and Posner there are five practices of exemplary leaders model, they have model, the way inspire a shared vision challenge the process and able others to act and encourage the heart, I think, in some ways is does.

855
02:08:35,190 --> 02:08:42,210
Laura Power: does bring in a lot of what you said earlier.

856
02:08:42,210 --> 02:08:48,510
Laura Power: right before I keep going any comments questions.

857
02:08:48,510 --> 02:09:02,730
Anam: I need one of the things that really stood out to me was when it on the one about communication like it was not just how you communicate, but there was a line there about also listening, so I think it speaks.

858
02:09:02,730 --> 02:09:18,180
Anam: A lot of the ideas that were brought up about you know, being a follower but also like communication is not just about like you know, can you write, are you a good public speaker but also like do you take the time to listen to people and then respond accordingly.

859
02:09:18,180 --> 02:09:19,380
Laura Power: mm hmm yeah.

860
02:09:19,380 --> 02:09:24,420
Laura Power: that's a great point and I think that also helps to build the trust, as long as we feel listened to and.

861
02:09:24,420 --> 02:09:28,440
Laura Power: input is obtained and acted on.

862
02:09:28,440 --> 02:09:31,530
Thank you.

863
02:09:31,530 --> 02:09:35,880
Laura Power: So pretty well leading into the activity here, so the assignment.

864
02:09:35,880 --> 02:09:52,680
Laura Power: So one of the things too is thinking about we talked about emotional intelligence self awareness, so this idea of being aware of your own strengths, so a good leader is someone who's aware of their own personal strengths and that's kind of at the kind of the heart of this is an.

865
02:09:52,680 --> 02:09:55,770
Laura Power: aliyah you were saying you know thinking about leading yourself.

866
02:09:55,770 --> 02:10:05,850
Laura Power: You know, like how at what level are we thinking about leadership so there's all these different levels from yourself, all the way to a big movement that you could be inspiring and leading.

867
02:10:05,850 --> 02:10:14,400
Laura Power: And then anywhere in between so there's a lot of different ways of being a leader, but all these in at the heart of it really is understanding how you fit into that.

868
02:10:14,400 --> 02:10:29,460
Laura Power: And so, this gets into understanding your strengths, of course, I mean maybe you've heard of the clifton strengths some of you've probably done the test the self assessment before and you'll have the opportunity to do it again, but I like this.

869
02:10:29,460 --> 02:10:37,530
Laura Power: A leader needs to know his drinks as a carpenter knows his tools or as a physician knows the instruments at her disposal what great leaders have in common.

870
02:10:37,530 --> 02:10:48,660
Laura Power: Is that each truly knows his or her strengths and can call in the right strings at the right time, this explains why there is no definitive list of characteristics that describes all leaders.

871
02:10:48,660 --> 02:10:54,780
Laura Power: So I really like that one because you know, especially as studying leadership and trying to bring it all together, putting.

872
02:10:54,780 --> 02:11:09,540
Laura Power: Like a lecture together about leadership there's so many different ways of thinking about it, I think that that's so true, but there are really just so many different ways and ultimately it's important to understand your strengths and how they play into all that.

873
02:11:09,540 --> 02:11:15,330
Laura Power: So strength based leadership is another way of thinking about leadership and.

874
02:11:15,330 --> 02:11:27,450
Laura Power: This quote says, all too often leaders are blind to the obvious when it comes to something of critical importance to them their own personality, how do they fit in so really understanding yourself having that self awareness.

875
02:11:27,450 --> 02:11:36,480
Laura Power: In this situation, the most effective leaders are always investing in their strength surround themselves with the right people and understand the needs of their followers.

876
02:11:36,480 --> 02:11:43,320
Laura Power: So this leads into the assignment, which I will let you work on for the year, welcome to get this done now.

877
02:11:43,320 --> 02:11:52,140
Laura Power: we're working on whenever you want tonight, but the assignment is to do a couple self assessments and i'll pull the canvas page up to you to make sure y'all see it but.

878
02:11:52,140 --> 02:12:01,410
Laura Power: Basically it's doing three self assessments that are be about your strengths your leadership style and then thinking about public health leadership skills, specifically that you want to know more about.

879
02:12:01,410 --> 02:12:14,940
Laura Power: The first is the Gallup or close to office gallop and called the clifton strengths assessment, so the strength clifton strengths are the Gallup strengths and who's done these before i'm sure some of you.

880
02:12:14,940 --> 02:12:22,020
Laura Power: For those of you who have yeah if you take in public health 516 I think you guys do it they're.

881
02:12:22,020 --> 02:12:29,430
Laura Power: Good so there's like a handful of you that have done it um so you're welcome to do it again, I encourage you to do it again, because sometimes you.

882
02:12:29,430 --> 02:12:40,410
Laura Power: can see if your findings are consistent, I know, for some of you probably did it within the last year, maybe because you did it with public health 516 so probably they haven't changed that much but it'd be interesting to see.

883
02:12:40,410 --> 02:12:45,780
Laura Power: And then you know, for me, I had done it several years ago and then did it again kind of.

884
02:12:45,780 --> 02:12:54,660
Laura Power: shifting from my old like old job to my new job that I have and just the work that I do change of it and and some of them changed so.

885
02:12:54,660 --> 02:13:05,550
Laura Power: Supposedly, we have all the same strains but he might like move up and down so maybe in here, you get the top five one so maybe my others didn't quite make it to the top five at that time.

886
02:13:05,550 --> 02:13:08,430
Laura Power: All right, let me.

887
02:13:08,430 --> 02:13:12,090
Laura Power: Go to.

888
02:13:12,090 --> 02:13:13,590
The.

889
02:13:13,590 --> 02:13:17,280
Laura Power: Candidate canvas page so make sure you all see.

890
02:13:17,280 --> 02:13:23,610
Laura Power: So now i'm here because i'm seeing my screen yes okay.

891
02:13:23,610 --> 02:13:29,430
Laura Power: Okay, so for the self assessments there's a worksheet here, you can download that.

892
02:13:29,430 --> 02:13:37,650
Laura Power: And you'll see as you when you download it that you'll have three different things one, the first one, I might what I would recommend that you do.

893
02:13:37,650 --> 02:13:43,830
Laura Power: Is that because i'm going to give you an access code and you got to set up an account if you don't have one and sometimes it takes.

894
02:13:43,830 --> 02:14:02,340
Laura Power: A little bit of time, sometimes it's fast sometimes it's slow, so what you could do is start that and while you wait for your code to get processed you could go on to the others, which is the leadership style quiz or to like a free short, you know online quiz and then this, which is just.

895
02:14:02,340 --> 02:14:15,000
Laura Power: You know, assessing yourself, or where you feel your skills are for these public health leadership self self assessment so you could kind of finish that and then maybe go back and do the strengths Finder.

896
02:14:15,000 --> 02:14:24,390
Laura Power: on the street, you ought to set up a code i'll give you the access code, so you set up the account it does take a little time, so you know, make sure if you start now make sure you're like.

897
02:14:24,390 --> 02:14:36,660
Laura Power: Good to go for 35 minutes or so, and then, when you finish this it will give you, I think it will email to you I believe your top five strengths and kind of interesting.

898
02:14:36,660 --> 02:14:44,850
Laura Power: summaries, and I know when I always enjoy getting my own insight and I feel like Oh, they really know me like I.

899
02:14:44,850 --> 02:14:56,190
Laura Power: that's how I felt when everyone feels that way so we'll see how you guys feel and then so you'll do for each one you'll do the assessment and then there's some questions here in the boxes to answer.

900
02:14:56,190 --> 02:15:13,560
Laura Power: So kind of go through those answer the questions, then you can upload those to the canvas page and where you'll find your strength Finder access code is in this spreadsheet I think you should all be in here.

901
02:15:13,560 --> 02:15:15,570
Laura Power: And you can.

902
02:15:15,570 --> 02:15:24,480
Laura Power: click here to get there, your code is here, your to set up your own account so from here, you you set up your own stuff and.

903
02:15:24,480 --> 02:15:26,730
Laura Power: Then.

904
02:15:26,730 --> 02:15:28,830
Laura Power: We stop sharing, let me just stop and see.

905
02:15:28,830 --> 02:15:32,070
Yolaine A Civil: What questions you have so I have a question.

906
02:15:32,070 --> 02:15:41,340
Yolaine A Civil: So we just did this 516 years ago, Michael another account.

907
02:15:41,340 --> 02:15:46,770
Laura Power: If you have your code to try to see if you can log in If not you might i'm not sure you like.

908
02:15:46,770 --> 02:15:49,170
Yolaine A Civil: You, I have to do it again.

909
02:15:49,170 --> 02:15:53,520
Yolaine A Civil: cuz i'm just worried about it, saying oh you already have an account.

910
02:15:53,520 --> 02:16:04,710
Laura Power: yeah you'll have to try so give it a try okay yeah try with your old account and don't tell you so occasionally when I do this, sometimes we have to like call that it's like the clifton's gallop.

911
02:16:04,710 --> 02:16:08,490
Laura Power: help desk because has helped me a couple times with students before.

912
02:16:08,490 --> 02:16:15,720
Laura Power: But I know like I just use a different code and like starting fresh so try it out your line, and let us know.

913
02:16:15,720 --> 02:16:16,800
Yolaine A Civil: Okay i'll do that.

914
02:16:16,800 --> 02:16:21,750
yeah.

915
02:16:21,750 --> 02:16:28,020
Laura Power: All right, how does it sound any questions.

916
02:16:28,020 --> 02:16:31,110
Laura Power: seems pretty straightforward.

917
02:16:31,110 --> 02:16:40,800
Laura Power: Excellent okay so that's what i'd like you you're welcome to work on that now you got 45 minutes of officially end of class and.

918
02:16:40,800 --> 02:16:46,200
Laura Power: The other thing I just want to point out so for day one.

919
02:16:46,200 --> 02:16:52,440
Laura Power: that's what that's the assignment is the self assessments again you'll upload that worksheet to canvas.

920
02:16:52,440 --> 02:16:56,850
Laura Power: Please do that before class tomorrow that would be excellent if you could.

921
02:16:56,850 --> 02:17:04,320
Laura Power: And then, if you get some time to help out for the class tomorrow there's a case study here, and then you could read as well.

922
02:17:04,320 --> 02:17:15,060
Laura Power: So it's just it's attached here, and you can kind of read this it's the story health and all neighborhoods the story of independent grocer as a public health leader.

923
02:17:15,060 --> 02:17:24,270
Laura Power: So I forgot that i'm not sharing my screen anymore so i'm like pointing at it, but you guys aren't seeing and family.

924
02:17:24,270 --> 02:17:42,960
Laura Power: All right, so I see a few faces you guys look Okay, so I will hang out here, and for a little bit in case you have questions you want to chat about anything, after so you're welcome to stay on and do this i'm going to just sit here and kind of do my email otherwise but i'll be here.

925
02:17:42,960 --> 02:17:48,720
Laura Power: And then, if not i'll see you all tomorrow at 130.

926
02:17:48,720 --> 02:18:03,660
Laura Power: Okay, thanks everybody was a good first day.

927
02:18:03,660 --> 02:18:06,510
Sammie Lyons (she/her): Dr power, I had a.

928
02:18:06,510 --> 02:18:10,830
Sammie Lyons (she/her): Question comment mixed in together.

929
02:18:10,830 --> 02:18:14,010
Sammie Lyons (she/her): I was curious about.

930
02:18:14,010 --> 02:18:19,980
Sammie Lyons (she/her): It was one of the last few slides, and it was like it was understanding the needs of the followers I can't remember what the.

931
02:18:19,980 --> 02:18:25,800
Sammie Lyons (she/her): The title of the sidelines, but I was thinking about that, and I wanted to add the qualifier.

932
02:18:25,800 --> 02:18:42,300
Sammie Lyons (she/her): And i'm wondering how to because I feel like this is a problem I run in in the different student organizations that I run at the Medical School is understanding the needs of the followers but at the same time not being responsible for their emotions.

933
02:18:42,300 --> 02:18:57,330
Sammie Lyons (she/her): And it feels sticky it feels sticky I feel like I can't i'm struggling to separate the two or when I think the Medical School environment is just a very unique place to be.

934
02:18:57,330 --> 02:19:08,640
Sammie Lyons (she/her): And I think in general students struggle with feedback and I think it gets more complicated to when you're in a student organization and we are.

935
02:19:08,640 --> 02:19:18,930
Sammie Lyons (she/her): horizontally comparable in terms of being students, but then elected to positions within student groups and then you're trying to.

936
02:19:18,930 --> 02:19:32,610
Sammie Lyons (she/her): Now you're now not responsible, just for yourself and I present yourself in the school, but also the organization that you're representing, and so I don't know where my question is exactly other than.

937
02:19:32,610 --> 02:19:47,280
Sammie Lyons (she/her): Just like how to navigate understand their needs, but recognizing that you aren't responsible for the emotions, even if, when you provide feedback somehow the person receiving the feedback ties that all in together.

938
02:19:47,280 --> 02:19:51,930
Laura Power: Here you're saying i'm going to see to if anyone I know others were.

939
02:19:51,930 --> 02:19:54,630
Laura Power: paying attention and had any comments or wanted to add to.

940
02:19:54,630 --> 02:19:59,190
That.

941
02:19:59,190 --> 02:20:06,030
Quintin Solano: I mean i'll just second what Sammy saying, I think, being in leadership positions in the Medical School especially early on our first year.

942
02:20:06,030 --> 02:20:17,160
Quintin Solano: Being a student Council, we had a lot of concerns and things like that that were brought to us and I struggle with the you know i'm not responsible for other people's emotions, but a lot of.

943
02:20:17,160 --> 02:20:25,620
Quintin Solano: Things i've read and try the understanding, I tried to build is, you know as a leader it's important to know your teammates so.

944
02:20:25,620 --> 02:20:41,610
Quintin Solano: oftentimes if somebody's emotional or is getting upset or presents with emotional concerns I tried to understand where they're coming from in terms of like what is really upsetting them about this, what is the real issue.

945
02:20:41,610 --> 02:20:54,630
Quintin Solano: And like Why is a problem because oftentimes what we found at least in discussing with students is like they weren't really mad about the situation at hand, they were more so upset with.

946
02:20:54,630 --> 02:21:05,550
Quintin Solano: The other situations that they were dealing with at the time, in conjunction with everything else going on as tammy had alluded to it's like a very busy environment and Medical School.

947
02:21:05,550 --> 02:21:14,460
Quintin Solano: And so having all of that understanding and then talking with the student and then, knowing that I have them understanding actually like I felt like put them at ease a little bit.

948
02:21:14,460 --> 02:21:23,700
Quintin Solano: And I felt like I was better able to understand what they were where they were coming from and try to offer solutions or go to bat for them in a way.

949
02:21:23,700 --> 02:21:29,580
Quintin Solano: When it came to either doing things with administration or if they were on a team with me.

950
02:21:29,580 --> 02:21:41,910
Quintin Solano: I better understood, their capabilities and then they would then you know, in essence, be able to drop things because I understood if they were like I can't do this and here's why quintin.

951
02:21:41,910 --> 02:21:56,160
Quintin Solano: I would never obviously push back I would then say that's fine it just like now, we need to find someone else to do that, or I take on that responsibility or however that works and that's how i've kind of navigated it and I don't think it's a perfect system.

952
02:21:56,160 --> 02:21:58,050
Quintin Solano: But I think that was just one away.

953
02:21:58,050 --> 02:22:09,750
Laura Power: yeah yeah no, I think, I think, especially as you're pointing out, you know doing this with your peers to it, because that can be, I think that adds an extra layer of complication where.

954
02:22:09,750 --> 02:22:16,590
Laura Power: Sometimes, like I think you'll enzyme like I think of myself as the leader of the pre MED program but i'm.

955
02:22:16,590 --> 02:22:25,590
Laura Power: I remember being in their vote but i'm not in it right now i'm actually separate from it, some, and that is different than being leader that's also within the same.

956
02:22:25,590 --> 02:22:32,220
Laura Power: program in some ways are like the teacher and the students like there's a separate I don't know if separation is the right word, but it is.

957
02:22:32,220 --> 02:22:49,980
Laura Power: I think an added layer of complication for you as a leader within your peer group as well and, and I think Sam you, you were talking about like separating out there's understanding that you're not if you're a leader but you're not necessarily you can't control their emotional response.

958
02:22:49,980 --> 02:22:53,520
Laura Power: And having an understanding of.

959
02:22:53,520 --> 02:22:54,390
Sammie Lyons (she/her): Like.

960
02:22:54,390 --> 02:23:09,270
Laura Power: I think that gets to some of that emotional intelligence stuff of which goes both ways it goes inside like understanding your own but also being able to look out and see that there's something going on and what Clinton was saying, like.

961
02:23:09,270 --> 02:23:23,370
Laura Power: And I think when they're coming like, just like the iceberg, you know what's what's going on underneath it all like, why is that happening what's the mental model that that person has and why are they so sometimes trying to understand that can help.

962
02:23:23,370 --> 02:23:35,310
Laura Power: But it is hard so some of that I think even gets it to your own like kind of like your own resiliency and like able to separate out.

963
02:23:35,310 --> 02:23:47,160
Laura Power: So yeah getting back to the first thing it's like well Okay, we need to know what our followers need and and but then somehow being able to separate out.

964
02:23:47,160 --> 02:23:49,740
Laura Power: You know.

965
02:23:49,740 --> 02:24:06,000
Laura Power: is giving them the tools to understand to process what's happening so if someone's upset or someone's to having you know or they're angry or upset or disappointed, or whatever it is it's it's helping them processes in some way.

966
02:24:06,000 --> 02:24:12,360
Laura Power: But not being necessarily responsible for it, which could be hard and I think sometimes we get sucked into that.

967
02:24:12,360 --> 02:24:20,070
Sammie Lyons (she/her): You know, especially here like taking it taking it on like to quit and thing I think the scenario that I have my head that i'm being very vague about.

968
02:24:20,070 --> 02:24:27,810
Sammie Lyons (she/her): is very different from what Clinton was talking about it, like someone can't do the responsibility anymore versus you're giving feedback on someone's performance.

969
02:24:27,810 --> 02:24:37,980
Sammie Lyons (she/her): yeah as a student leader and they tend to not be super thrilled about that and come back to the.

970
02:24:37,980 --> 02:24:49,860
Sammie Lyons (she/her): it's argument, so to speak, of like we're all peers we're on the same level, but it's slightly different like i'm in an elected position to guide you in this capacity.

971
02:24:49,860 --> 02:24:58,410
Sammie Lyons (she/her): Right so that's where it gets like very muddy I think it'd be very different if we were in the workforce, and it was very clearly like delineated.

972
02:24:58,410 --> 02:25:00,000
Laura Power: Like structure.

973
02:25:00,000 --> 02:25:01,710
Sammie Lyons (she/her): manager like.

974
02:25:01,710 --> 02:25:17,760
Sammie Lyons (she/her): Worker like just in that capacity would make it a lot easier, but that's not how it is and so that's I think that's one of the challenges of student organizations, in particular, and especially, as we all become well we're already adults but working our way through adult experiences.

975
02:25:17,760 --> 02:25:20,520
Sammie Lyons (she/her): yeah how about that mixes together.

976
02:25:20,520 --> 02:25:23,190
yeah.

977
02:25:23,190 --> 02:25:33,840
Sammie Lyons (she/her): No it's good I was like yes, I totally get that and then mine I didn't like explain it well because i'm not giving any details about the situation but it's like just happened last week and i'm like.

978
02:25:33,840 --> 02:25:38,250
Sammie Lyons (she/her): Oh, my God this this leadership classes perfect timing.

979
02:25:38,250 --> 02:25:41,970
Laura Power: yeah you share that and.

980
02:25:41,970 --> 02:25:46,230
Laura Power: I do think it makes it murky or when you are with your peers and.

981
02:25:46,230 --> 02:25:59,190
Laura Power: In any like that can happen like i'm just trying to reflect on different examples like in my peer group, like a bunch of faculty and we're all getting together to to work on something, and maybe none of us are assigned it, you know, like.

982
02:25:59,190 --> 02:26:12,210
Laura Power: A formal leadership, but what are you know, maybe even an informal way someone's meeting, and it can be hard you know, taking feedback, some people are better at receiving feedback and others.

983
02:26:12,210 --> 02:26:15,510
Laura Power: So that is hard to separate out and if.

984
02:26:15,510 --> 02:26:26,820
Laura Power: You can try, you know i'm sure you've already done this like thinking through the way you deliver it or how you kind of come at it, or like sometimes you come in and more like Oh, you know and.

985
02:26:26,820 --> 02:26:31,950
Laura Power: In your boat, you know there's there's different like ways to approach, but sometimes.

986
02:26:31,950 --> 02:26:37,680
Laura Power: people get briskly and then you just have to be able to.

987
02:26:37,680 --> 02:26:39,840
Sammie Lyons (she/her): still be diplomatic and separate me.

988
02:26:39,840 --> 02:26:41,190
Laura Power: yeah yeah I think.

989
02:26:41,190 --> 02:26:49,380
Sammie Lyons (she/her): I can't do anything else here, and I even like in this particular situation I consulted someone who is not affiliated with the Medical School.

990
02:26:49,380 --> 02:27:07,710
Sammie Lyons (she/her): Who barely knows me and just like hey do you have time for like 3030 minutes, can I run through what the situation was and i'm going to show you all of like the communications, where, could I have done better was there something wrong with what I said, did it come off.

991
02:27:07,710 --> 02:27:10,950
Sammie Lyons (she/her): To antagonistic Lee if that's a word.

992
02:27:10,950 --> 02:27:16,260
Sammie Lyons (she/her): Like what should I, but then, and then there was also the commentary of like well.

993
02:27:16,260 --> 02:27:30,810
Sammie Lyons (she/her): I thought, like would it be different, with the response been different if I was a man versus a woman, and I do believe that that was a part of it, not all of it, and so that that was interesting for me kind of.

994
02:27:30,810 --> 02:27:41,910
Sammie Lyons (she/her): i'm still reflecting on this to like figure out how to do better in terms of ways to combat this as a student I always found like bringing in the advisors.

995
02:27:41,910 --> 02:27:49,860
Sammie Lyons (she/her): You know, like looping them into threads has always been helpful and then also like the office of student conflict resolution does a lot of workshops.

996
02:27:49,860 --> 02:27:50,970
Laura Power: and student groups.

997
02:27:50,970 --> 02:27:51,240
Sammie Lyons (she/her): And they.

998
02:27:51,240 --> 02:27:53,340
Sammie Lyons (she/her): have to do preemptive workshops.

999
02:27:53,340 --> 02:27:54,030
Laura Power: And I think.

1000
02:27:54,030 --> 02:28:03,930
Sammie Lyons (she/her): That might be a good idea, one specifically on communication around feedback and what that looks like and recognizing that this is an element of the student group.

1001
02:28:03,930 --> 02:28:13,830
Sammie Lyons (she/her): And so, when you feel these feel these things coming from appear, why is that and so maybe that would be helpful, maybe not for this situation that's passed, but for future ones.

1002
02:28:13,830 --> 02:28:22,320
Laura Power: yeah I think it's good to talk through sometimes other people just it's sometimes helpful just to get like Okay, let me just check, let me just get a gut check with somebody.

1003
02:28:22,320 --> 02:28:33,570
Laura Power: And just make sure i'm like Am I missing something and I am I am I taking it to personally like you know, whatever, however, we tend to respond Clinton, I think you have a nice point to about.

1004
02:28:33,570 --> 02:28:35,070
Laura Power: yeah they might need it.

1005
02:28:35,070 --> 02:28:38,070
Quintin Solano: But yeah right right yeah.

1006
02:28:38,070 --> 02:28:49,470
Laura Power: I was actually you probably are learning about this in MED school, but that you know the idea like various cultural competence, and you know just thinking about like.

1007
02:28:49,470 --> 02:29:02,460
Laura Power: Asking to give feedback So when I remember remembering reflecting on a session, I was in recently that was about communicating with with patients so it's more of the doctor patient scenario, but it's kind of the same thing, it was like.

1008
02:29:02,460 --> 02:29:10,950
Laura Power: Can I it was about behavior change so not so much like here's diagnosing and this is what I think about you know take this antibiotic or whatever it was more like.

1009
02:29:10,950 --> 02:29:19,110
Laura Power: Trying to motivate people to do behavior changes for certain things, but it was trying to assess what do they want to hear what are they ready for.

1010
02:29:19,110 --> 02:29:25,110
Laura Power: and definitely that was actually the thing that when there was like a checklist with our learners had to do to.

1011
02:29:25,110 --> 02:29:33,870
Laura Power: When they talk to their patients like how well did they do, and then the one that most people plan it out, and I know I definitely was not doing consistently my own patient care was.

1012
02:29:33,870 --> 02:29:50,880
Laura Power: asking if people wanted to hear my advice you know I think we're trained in medicine to just like tell people to do, and so that really stood out to a lot of people was like oh yeah, I guess, I could have worded it differently or brought it up or kind of asked permission.

1013
02:29:50,880 --> 02:29:56,580
Laura Power: But sometimes yeah maybe they really need to know it, but they don't want to hear it and.

1014
02:29:56,580 --> 02:29:59,040
Laura Power: Those can be really tricky.

1015
02:29:59,040 --> 02:30:06,840
Quintin Solano: I think, to we we don't do a good job, and I say we, meaning the entire Medical School and medical community of training.

1016
02:30:06,840 --> 02:30:21,960
Quintin Solano: People to teach training people to provide feedback training people to receive feedback, because there is a way of thinking about feedback that has helped me frame a lot of the poor feedback that i've received during my medical training into a much more positive light.

1017
02:30:21,960 --> 02:30:33,270
Quintin Solano: And you know, being a student Council we get a lot of concerns and things like that brought to us of you know, the evaluation system, and I know, things can be improved and stuff.

1018
02:30:33,270 --> 02:30:40,020
Quintin Solano: As it pertains to our grading and stuff like that, but some of the feedback that that we received is just pretty poor, to be quite honest.

1019
02:30:40,020 --> 02:30:41,910
Quintin Solano: But there's always something.

1020
02:30:41,910 --> 02:30:53,670
Quintin Solano: And this might just be my optimism and thought, but there's always something you can get from it in terms of like yeah unless it's read more which is like obvious like now i'm going to actually stop reading.

1021
02:30:53,670 --> 02:30:56,460
Laura Power: All right, you.

1022
02:30:56,460 --> 02:30:57,450
Quintin Solano: Might.

1023
02:30:57,450 --> 02:31:07,410
Quintin Solano: Like continue to develop your you know reading give those, like all right yeah I could go home and read a paper thanks um but yeah and I, and I don't know.

1024
02:31:07,410 --> 02:31:12,720
Quintin Solano: Sammy i'm sure you probably handled it very well, especially if you went and talked to the people about the situation and things like.

1025
02:31:12,720 --> 02:31:24,870
Quintin Solano: It sounds like you did your best, and I from my experience I just think certain colleagues that we will work with in our life are just going to be better or worse receiving feedback.

1026
02:31:24,870 --> 02:31:35,250
Quintin Solano: And you know it's unfortunate, but I think we, we need to do a better job of training people how to receive feedback and you know, the first thing is to always never.

1027
02:31:35,250 --> 02:31:42,630
Quintin Solano: always assume positive intent, especially when it's somebody trying to like give you constructive criticism or tell you like hey you did this wrong.

1028
02:31:42,630 --> 02:31:45,150
Quintin Solano: You know so it's tough.

1029
02:31:45,150 --> 02:31:46,260
Quintin Solano: But to me it sounds like you.

1030
02:31:46,260 --> 02:31:49,260
Quintin Solano: You did a good job.

1031
02:31:49,260 --> 02:31:53,400
Laura Power: Is a professional development point to just thinking about how to receive feedback.

1032
02:31:53,400 --> 02:31:56,790
Laura Power: We definitely don't teach people how to give feedback and i'm.

1033
02:31:56,790 --> 02:32:01,950
Laura Power: Still learning how to do that, over time, you know this point in my career.

1034
02:32:01,950 --> 02:32:06,420
Laura Power: But that's definitely not something especially medicine, I think we're not trained that way, and I think.

1035
02:32:06,420 --> 02:32:18,720
Laura Power: It would last just looking at like are a lot of our public health screening to aside from our professional development class dash which we didn't talk about feedback at all, you know that's not something that we've really learned about there either.

1036
02:32:18,720 --> 02:32:21,150
Joshua Bosman: uh huh yeah.

1037
02:32:21,150 --> 02:32:22,230
Joshua Bosman: Oh sorry i'm.

1038
02:32:22,230 --> 02:32:23,640
Quintin Solano: Not sorry I just.

1039
02:32:23,640 --> 02:32:31,680
Joshua Bosman: I was gonna say there you know you get sprinkles of it through certain electives and the general public health courses are really good for that, but.

1040
02:32:31,680 --> 02:32:36,810
Joshua Bosman: yeah by and large it's really lacking.

1041
02:32:36,810 --> 02:32:38,820
Laura Power: focused.

1042
02:32:38,820 --> 02:32:45,960
Sammie Lyons (she/her): there's a psychologist at harvard's Dr Susan gold and she talks about.

1043
02:32:45,960 --> 02:32:51,840
Sammie Lyons (she/her): Emotions and not just your own personal regulation of emotions, but like.

1044
02:32:51,840 --> 02:33:08,760
Sammie Lyons (she/her): Managing other emotions, which I think is very different from not being responsible for them, but still as a leader needing to manage them, because that is there it's connected likely to the needs of the followers, so I think the linguistic.

1045
02:33:08,760 --> 02:33:20,730
Sammie Lyons (she/her): nuances of the way she talks about emotions is really insightful and renee brown coming back in hat into the conversation of.

1046
02:33:20,730 --> 02:33:40,560
Sammie Lyons (she/her): The vulnerability when we're her research when she talks to people who've been in like the research that she's developed talks to people who have really been successful in their career successful defined by societal standards, but then also personal standards, a lot of it is due to.

1047
02:33:40,560 --> 02:33:59,370
Sammie Lyons (she/her): The fact that they are that they are open to feedback that they allow themselves to be vulnerable and like lower down the Armor so that they can actually continue to improve themselves, even if they are in a higher position, so to speak, then other people within their organization.

1048
02:33:59,370 --> 02:34:04,650
Laura Power: Great Clinton, I see yours as well, I was just googling him too so.

1049
02:34:04,650 --> 02:34:12,210
Quintin Solano: yeah he's a he's a fantastic author he's got a good podcast to he gets a lot of former commanders generals and stuff like that on there and.

1050
02:34:12,210 --> 02:34:17,400
Quintin Solano: The talk a lot about leadership and stuff like that it's very obvious from a war perspective but.

1051
02:34:17,400 --> 02:34:27,300
Quintin Solano: The way I kind of look at that as like while yes, there are like a lot of you know, negative things that come from war and a lot of people may not agree, I think it's like arguably one of the harshest areas that you can learn lessons in.

1052
02:34:27,300 --> 02:34:33,210
Quintin Solano: Especially when people are trying to kill you at all times, and if you can transfer those into.

1053
02:34:33,210 --> 02:34:46,050
Quintin Solano: You know i'm sitting in my room in Ann arbor and I have you know running water and stuff right behind me, and all that, like, if I can transfer those lessons here like that's pretty cool so I read a lot of like war books and stuff and get a lot of lessons from them yeah.

1054
02:34:46,050 --> 02:34:57,960
Laura Power: I do, I really like finding podcasts like you like you know, can I can listen to him real quick and I really enjoyed some of the leadership and skills to go along that like.

1055
02:34:57,960 --> 02:35:09,330
Laura Power: Negotiating and just like different ways of handling situations i've gotten good ideas actually from listening to these podcasts because I never landed anywhere else so sometimes i'm heading into a specific scenario.

1056
02:35:09,330 --> 02:35:19,770
Laura Power: And I was like like I had to do a negotiation once for myself and I was certainly a typical like I didn't you just take what's offered, and I mean I was asking for more.

1057
02:35:19,770 --> 02:35:31,620
Laura Power: And I had like I listened to this podcast and it it helped me it helped me frame my whole thing, and I mean, I was in a good position, so if I lost that negotiation, I was a really bad negotiators, but.

1058
02:35:31,620 --> 02:35:42,630
Laura Power: it's still helped me to make it like less uncomfortable for me because it's not something I liked doing this, to ask for more put it helps so I love having these podcasts and I just.

1059
02:35:42,630 --> 02:35:49,830
Laura Power: So appreciate that i'm gonna i'm taking notes I got the Google tabs open, so I can share them on the canvas page to.

1060
02:35:49,830 --> 02:35:57,840
Laura Power: Man This is excellent i'm so excited I feel like deep conversations on day one class, so I really appreciate it, I learned so much from.

1061
02:35:57,840 --> 02:36:07,170
Laura Power: Just those it really is reflecting on things and reflecting together and like sometimes you experiencing did you have I couldn't quite put the right words on it, or you haven't quite.

1062
02:36:07,170 --> 02:36:17,370
Laura Power: You know, said what it is so like Sammy like you trying to process through like that the situation you were talking about was kind of helpful to think through it together.

1063
02:36:17,370 --> 02:36:18,150
Laura Power: Some.

1064
02:36:18,150 --> 02:36:21,480
Thank you.

1065
02:36:21,480 --> 02:36:21,900
Quintin Solano: awesome.

1066
02:36:21,900 --> 02:36:26,760
Laura Power: Thanks for great first day yeah all right i'll see you guys tomorrow.

1067
02:36:26,760 --> 02:36:29,190
Joshua Bosman: Take care thanks yes.

1068
02:36:29,190 --> 02:36:31,590
Yolaine A Civil: Are we supposed to leave where we done.

1069
02:36:31,590 --> 02:36:36,840
Laura Power: You yeah yeah you're fine you, basically, I was just giving people time to work on stuff and.

1070
02:36:36,840 --> 02:36:39,300
Yolaine A Civil: I was working on it, but everybody loves.

1071
02:36:39,300 --> 02:36:41,430
Laura Power: yeah he was either way so.

1072
02:36:41,430 --> 02:36:50,040
Laura Power: Like last year I did it someone did the whole thing and I just I just got here while she was doing her computer thing but, but your mind is like were you able to login.

1073
02:36:50,040 --> 02:36:52,920
Yolaine A Civil: yeah I got my clifton strengths done.

1074
02:36:52,920 --> 02:36:55,470
Laura Power: You did you know that oh.

1075
02:36:55,470 --> 02:36:59,070
Yolaine A Civil: yeah I know myself.

1076
02:36:59,070 --> 02:37:02,580
Laura Power: So it'll be it'll be interesting to see the same as the ones you just did.

1077
02:37:02,580 --> 02:37:05,220
Yolaine A Civil: I think they're probably going to be yeah.

1078
02:37:05,220 --> 02:37:07,410
Laura Power: Oh john does you need to go down.

1079
02:37:07,410 --> 02:37:08,460
Laura Power: There to.

1080
02:37:08,460 --> 02:37:13,500
Yolaine A Civil: Get remembered me and then asked me if I wanted to.

1081
02:37:13,500 --> 02:37:20,160
Yolaine A Civil: choose the old one, or just use this one, and I said i'll do it again because.

1082
02:37:20,160 --> 02:37:23,310
Laura Power: Good okay.

1083
02:37:23,310 --> 02:37:29,670
Laura Power: awesome job I forgot to put your name on the spreadsheet, I think, but you can why don't you take with the one of the blink ones.

1084
02:37:29,670 --> 02:37:34,110
Joshua Bosman: No worries yeah that's that's what I figured I can do.

1085
02:37:34,110 --> 02:37:35,130
Laura Power: perfect.

1086
02:37:35,130 --> 02:37:38,550
Yolaine A Civil: So I was just gonna stay till i'm so silly.

1087
02:37:38,550 --> 02:37:41,490
Laura Power: Oh no you're good I mean really was hanging out here.

1088
02:37:41,490 --> 02:37:47,610
Yolaine A Civil: Well, I did my homework, because if I don't do it now, you know I have so much other homework to do.

1089
02:37:47,610 --> 02:37:52,830
Laura Power: yeah no do your homework get it done.

1090
02:37:52,830 --> 02:37:55,470
Laura Power: Did you make it through last two weeks feeling.

1091
02:37:55,470 --> 02:38:01,830
Yolaine A Civil: And that really will see the thing is the assignments for those classes are due on Friday.

1092
02:38:01,830 --> 02:38:06,390
Yolaine A Civil: Okay that's why, even though the classes over the work is no.

1093
02:38:06,390 --> 02:38:08,040
Laura Power: All right, and.

1094
02:38:08,040 --> 02:38:09,780
Yolaine A Civil: What i'm worried about.

1095
02:38:09,780 --> 02:38:11,610
Okay.

1096
02:38:11,610 --> 02:38:13,680
Laura Power: Can we help them anyway.

1097
02:38:13,680 --> 02:38:16,440
Yolaine A Civil: No, I just.

1098
02:38:16,440 --> 02:38:20,730
Laura Power: I wish I don't think I could help you with those questions, even if I tried at this point.

1099
02:38:20,730 --> 02:38:21,180
Laura Power: And the.

1100
02:38:21,180 --> 02:38:26,700
Yolaine A Civil: thing is, is that i'm just not as fast as I used to be.

1101
02:38:26,700 --> 02:38:29,460
