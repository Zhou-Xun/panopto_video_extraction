1
00:00:01,400 --> 00:00:10,910
Mm hmm. And all I can tell you is not in this way.

2
00:00:14,690 --> 00:00:26,550
I mean, I know I'm not going to be like that in a car in a couple months, you know?

3
00:00:31,620 --> 00:00:46,200
It's not like I know what I want my left behind the time, you know, to let me know what was there in the air.

4
00:00:49,290 --> 00:01:00,400
And I would want to say, you know, I think the other thing is.

5
00:01:03,010 --> 00:01:25,780
Was right there last night, and I wondered if you are still trying to be here or are you going to have to do this?

6
00:01:27,570 --> 00:01:28,620
I know. I know. I know.

7
00:01:29,500 --> 00:01:54,610
You're going to admit to the fact that we don't really know and we believe that this will help you prepare for the next year or two.

8
00:01:54,700 --> 00:02:05,350
But I want you to understand that we don't know what's been happening right now.

9
00:02:08,050 --> 00:02:10,180
So what I'm saying is that not.

10
00:02:12,930 --> 00:02:30,490
At least for me, I thought that, yeah, there was a problem, but I was just thinking that, I mean, I was thinking that we needed to go.

11
00:02:32,060 --> 00:02:35,120
Yeah, we wanted to know if this is our.

12
00:02:35,960 --> 00:02:38,870
Hello, everyone. Sorry. Give me a quick minute, because the thing is this.

13
00:02:39,010 --> 00:02:44,390
This this thing is pretty flaky and I'm having trouble connecting it with my laptop as opposed to this one because I

14
00:02:44,440 --> 00:02:50,540
don't have out here and I've got on my system sometimes so to figured the best way out to sort of deal with this.

15
00:02:50,540 --> 00:02:56,480
I'm sorry for all the technical stuff that this room usually has or my system has.

16
00:02:57,860 --> 00:03:01,880
Worst case, we do the same thing the last time around. Called him up and figured it out.

17
00:03:02,230 --> 00:03:11,250
I do something that I really don't like.

18
00:03:12,050 --> 00:03:16,660
It's very hard. I don't think I can do this, you know?

19
00:03:17,060 --> 00:03:20,180
I know. I know.

20
00:03:20,880 --> 00:03:23,800
They have to disclose everything.

21
00:03:24,750 --> 00:03:42,420
I mean, that's exactly what I think, that I think that as long as we continue to make the most of your saying, we just need to do this.

22
00:03:42,440 --> 00:03:50,610
I don't know. You know, I thought about it just like the rescuers.

23
00:03:53,210 --> 00:04:11,380
This collision between the be of us and of course and then, you know, I'm going to call that I think I have called the voice that is in college.

24
00:04:11,380 --> 00:04:27,860
So usually I think the song he was there last must really the only thing I was going to say so I'm like, oh, I'm gonna go on my social media.

25
00:04:27,870 --> 00:04:35,340
You heard that.

26
00:04:36,730 --> 00:05:04,600
And they have to keep that in mind.

27
00:05:05,170 --> 00:05:12,340
So what I'm going to do is I'm going to project it from here. I'm going to share my screen on Zoom from my laptop and get the article working.

28
00:05:12,340 --> 00:05:16,719
Okay, I'm sorry, this is awful, but this is what we have to do.

29
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:20,020
Okay. Or maybe I would see.

30
00:05:26,650 --> 00:05:37,550
Almost anywhere did you all if you download are our studio on your systems perfect again.

31
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:49,520
What the [INAUDIBLE] are you? We should be good then.

32
00:05:50,210 --> 00:06:16,080
Let's see. Okay.

33
00:06:37,270 --> 00:06:44,680
I think we should do good. Yeah.

34
00:06:53,740 --> 00:07:08,580
Of your wonderful. Let me set up here as well so that we can run a race more time when it comes to that.

35
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:15,300
I think we should be good with that to account for that.

36
00:07:19,960 --> 00:07:28,610
Wonderful. Awesome.

37
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:35,239
Yeah. And then upload these files after class today. But we'll have a bunch of group exercises and class and stuff today.

38
00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:38,540
So we should be. We should be good. Oh, my God. This is bad.

39
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:42,830
I'm going to turn the lights off. Does anybody know how the lights in this room work?

40
00:07:43,310 --> 00:07:47,480
And you could turn this guy like you want a lot of things on them.

41
00:07:47,660 --> 00:08:00,410
I took them on one here. Okay, great. Yeah, I can increase the font.

42
00:08:00,410 --> 00:08:07,110
Perhaps you can so that. Okay.

43
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:10,840
Is this okay? Maybe one more.

44
00:08:15,690 --> 00:08:20,430
All right. Okay. This is okay, right? Yeah. And you will have the identifiers in your on time.

45
00:08:20,530 --> 00:08:24,840
So I think you should be good with that. But as long as it's just legible for the class.

46
00:08:24,900 --> 00:08:28,860
Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Let's begin.

47
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:38,280
Okay. Sorry about we got 8 minutes behind, but that's fine. We give you guys early today.

48
00:08:38,280 --> 00:08:43,390
Okay so yes it he's uploaded on. They are not but I'm going to put them up there.

49
00:08:43,400 --> 00:08:48,750
Plus there's a lot of the stuff today is going to be focused on just understanding the basic modeling and then we start coding.

50
00:08:49,110 --> 00:08:58,080
So after I move to a or maybe let me just upload the artifacts to canvas because I think that's more important than this one.

51
00:08:59,190 --> 00:09:19,940
Give me a quick second. Okay. Yeah, but I.

52
00:09:28,630 --> 00:09:34,190
What? It seems it's not to in Panopto.

53
00:09:34,190 --> 00:09:38,479
I just got a message from one of the technical people that I'm having trouble with the

54
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:41,780
project to give me a call because I want to ensure that we have the recording going on.

55
00:09:43,490 --> 00:09:45,320
They're not to.

56
00:10:10,301 --> 00:10:15,691
So it's really not so you cannot I apparently should not be opening Panopto because then the recording stops and no, it's okay.

57
00:10:16,901 --> 00:10:19,901
Okay. Thank you so much for your patience again. Now we are set to go.

58
00:10:20,531 --> 00:10:25,900
Hello and welcome everyone. Second class for aid for health care and policy today.

59
00:10:25,901 --> 00:10:29,381
A last glossary of it. Very. Yeah.

60
00:10:30,041 --> 00:10:33,220
So last class we essentially introduce to you big data on health care,

61
00:10:33,221 --> 00:10:39,161
e-mail and health care specifically lots of examples why email is a big deal and has

62
00:10:39,641 --> 00:10:44,591
already has had a lot of impact on the way health care clinical decision making is done.

63
00:10:45,011 --> 00:10:50,101
And what's the future. So to say again, in a nutshell, so to say, right,

64
00:10:50,111 --> 00:10:56,981
the objective of this class is to give you a much more detailed and thorough introduction to those things, opportunities as well as challenges.

65
00:10:57,311 --> 00:11:03,821
And we sort of just got our feet wet, so to say, right? In last class we talked about some of the mechanistic tools which we will be

66
00:11:03,821 --> 00:11:07,960
covering over the next two or three weeks rate prediction classifications,

67
00:11:07,961 --> 00:11:15,731
some sort of natural language processing and causal inference, which is essentially are very important from a policy perspective and applications.

68
00:11:15,731 --> 00:11:19,751
And we also sort of, you know, talked a bit about some of the problems with the own health care,

69
00:11:19,991 --> 00:11:25,511
particularly about sort of bias, fairness, implications for trust, interpretability.

70
00:11:25,511 --> 00:11:32,921
Right. And hopefully now we can start dealing with each of these sort of issues or topics one by one.

71
00:11:33,041 --> 00:11:35,830
Again, we also talked a fair bit about the code structure.

72
00:11:35,831 --> 00:11:40,060
And if you have any questions about that, feel free to ask me because we don't have a recording of the lecture,

73
00:11:40,061 --> 00:11:43,481
but we have the syllabus and the slides from last week all up there.

74
00:11:43,751 --> 00:11:49,071
I haven't put the slides up yet. I'll put it out in the break or something. I want to just get the first topic going on.

75
00:11:49,541 --> 00:11:55,661
Okay. So based on your responses to the sorry, so we have I put up two officers.

76
00:11:55,901 --> 00:11:59,051
I mean, there was no time that work for everyone, understandably so. Right.

77
00:11:59,651 --> 00:12:02,741
There are two Mondays and Wednesdays, one one hour each.

78
00:12:02,741 --> 00:12:07,570
I mean, the zoom links are on canvas. I wasn't sure if you all wanted in-person officers.

79
00:12:07,571 --> 00:12:13,871
Maybe I'll have some sort of a poll on canvas to see how many of you want in-person sort of office hours visit by Zoom.

80
00:12:14,081 --> 00:12:21,131
And then maybe we can make one of them in-person and that should be somewhere while the other one can be on Zoom, whatever works best.

81
00:12:21,341 --> 00:12:25,121
But beyond these officers, given that there was few overlap for yours,

82
00:12:25,331 --> 00:12:30,101
I'm happy to schedule one on one meetings or even one on group meetings over the course of the semester.

83
00:12:30,431 --> 00:12:34,331
I think we'll have to do more of that anyway once we start working on, you know,

84
00:12:34,541 --> 00:12:39,010
case studies and class presentations where, you know, each groups of two or three of you.

85
00:12:39,011 --> 00:12:45,161
Right will be present in those things and we'll be working closely to ensure that that's smooth and set up.

86
00:12:45,491 --> 00:12:49,601
And yeah. Okay. Of the video recordings, hopefully now should be on canvas.

87
00:12:49,601 --> 00:12:55,171
So I hope today's the last day of tech shows and from next week onwards you should be said.

88
00:12:55,421 --> 00:13:03,511
Yeah. So I actually thank you for the 12 of you who submitted the responses to the quiz to remember.

89
00:13:03,721 --> 00:13:08,491
The syllabus mentions that responding to quizzes and exercises as part of the class participation rate.

90
00:13:08,851 --> 00:13:12,181
So classes 17 to 18 students and 12 of you have responded.

91
00:13:13,231 --> 00:13:17,211
It's the first one, but going forward I would expect you all to sort of be on top of that.

92
00:13:17,221 --> 00:13:21,151
You know, it's hard for me to gauge where the classes are without and it's a small class.

93
00:13:21,151 --> 00:13:26,551
So it's easy to for me to point out. Right, who has or hasn't. So let's be a bit more meticulous about that.

94
00:13:27,811 --> 00:13:31,541
So I just want to sort of go over some of the expectations that you all have right from this class.

95
00:13:31,561 --> 00:13:35,731
And by and large, it did fit into what I had in mind for this class.

96
00:13:35,731 --> 00:13:39,451
Right. But there is some sort of a trade off. And let's let's talk about what the trade off is.

97
00:13:39,451 --> 00:13:43,740
Right. So clearly, we want to learn beyond the real world implications, the pros and the cons.

98
00:13:43,741 --> 00:13:51,631
And that's one of the key focus areas of this class and also learning and not just from an ER from a data scientist perspective,

99
00:13:51,931 --> 00:13:54,151
maybe some of you might end up becoming a data scientist. Right?

100
00:13:54,361 --> 00:14:00,840
But this class is meant to sort of give you an introduction so that and especially considering that some of you might go into consulting,

101
00:14:00,841 --> 00:14:05,191
some of you might go into sort of, you know, health administration, hospital systems and policy.

102
00:14:05,191 --> 00:14:12,060
Right. You might not be dealing with this programing on a daily basis, but at least if you're decision makers, you know, these challenges,

103
00:14:12,061 --> 00:14:17,550
what these problems and again, you know the jargon and you can speak with that sort of hopefully authority and leadership.

104
00:14:17,551 --> 00:14:21,961
Right. But again, it's always going to be a learning process. Right. I'm learning so much of what I.

105
00:14:23,151 --> 00:14:27,771
Four years after grad school. Right. That's going to keep happening. So, in short, you don't forget that.

106
00:14:28,851 --> 00:14:35,630
Yeah. Which is understandable. A lot of you will let what one comment was being less focused on how to use these programs or these other tools.

107
00:14:35,631 --> 00:14:42,291
Right. And more focus on understanding the capabilities. And that obviously is something we cannot do in the whole,

108
00:14:42,321 --> 00:14:48,230
which is understanding how these programs work in detail in a one semester class with so many objectives.

109
00:14:48,231 --> 00:14:57,441
Right. So especially the next this week and the next three or four weeks will be focused on the mechanistic to what's right as best as we can.

110
00:14:57,981 --> 00:15:03,061
Some of that might be uncomfortable, but once I come to the programing, I'll tell what I expect.

111
00:15:03,081 --> 00:15:08,031
What? What, from my perspective, successful for you would look like in this class, right?

112
00:15:08,571 --> 00:15:12,230
It's easy to get lost in that. That can easily go down a rabbit hole of our programing.

113
00:15:12,231 --> 00:15:14,391
Right. I'm not expecting you to do that. Right.

114
00:15:14,751 --> 00:15:21,900
The main objective of all the programing we will be doing in this class, right, is for you to be able to interpret what that code throwing order to.

115
00:15:21,901 --> 00:15:24,261
You write what those results are coming order to you.

116
00:15:24,471 --> 00:15:29,511
I don't I'm fine with you sort of running with so let's say a but a chunk of code that I've given.

117
00:15:29,961 --> 00:15:34,041
You understand what it does broadly, right, without expecting you to write it from scratch.

118
00:15:34,341 --> 00:15:40,821
But once the code gives you a set of results and estimates. Right, what I would want you to do is understand what do the results mean, right.

119
00:15:41,001 --> 00:15:48,080
And what the interpret those results, so to say. Again, this is definitely an intersection between tech and health care.

120
00:15:48,081 --> 00:15:53,251
We want to focus on that. The case studies are going to take care of that. How I am an influence is health policy.

121
00:15:53,251 --> 00:15:59,361
You couple of you were interested in the method and application of machine learning and that's the trade off, right?

122
00:15:59,361 --> 00:16:01,371
I mean, some of you want to get into it in more detail.

123
00:16:01,371 --> 00:16:06,740
I think I'm going to come to the next slide where how the class distribution in terms of our proficiency is concerned.

124
00:16:06,741 --> 00:16:12,821
Is that right? But we will do some of that. But you can reach out to me during or after this class.

125
00:16:12,831 --> 00:16:17,240
Right. And I can direct you to resources at Michigan and even outside Michigan.

126
00:16:17,241 --> 00:16:22,311
Right. If you want to go further, deep into these methods and tools to know what's doing that as well.

127
00:16:23,351 --> 00:16:26,201
And especially those of your first year students happy to sort of, you know,

128
00:16:26,201 --> 00:16:31,301
guide you on what sorts of classes you can take in the next one years to get more mastery over that.

129
00:16:31,751 --> 00:16:34,811
And again, that's what this one is about, a future health care leader, right.

130
00:16:35,291 --> 00:16:42,351
A lot of you might end up becoming future health care leaders. Right. So hopefully this class is really helpful in that particular sort of objective.

131
00:16:42,761 --> 00:16:47,641
And again, negative and positive bodies of these tools. Right. Proficiency and understanding of our side.

132
00:16:47,891 --> 00:16:54,401
I mean, as much as we can. Right. But again, three or four classes are not enough for you to help complete mastery of power.

133
00:16:54,971 --> 00:16:56,881
Okay, we'll see.

134
00:16:56,891 --> 00:17:03,941
As best as we can, think about how particular health care issues like reimbursements and value based sort of care are affected by e-mail.

135
00:17:04,271 --> 00:17:08,380
But again, too, so much of a spectrum of topics that the AMA can have an effect.

136
00:17:08,381 --> 00:17:13,361
Right. And that's when maybe the class project is going to be helpful. That because we though the ball is in your court.

137
00:17:13,361 --> 00:17:15,881
Right. And it's on a discussion based, of course. Right.

138
00:17:16,181 --> 00:17:21,760
How you can sort of identify how a high, let's say, could make a change on how risk scores are.

139
00:17:21,761 --> 00:17:25,660
Reimbursements are calculated for hospitals. A lot of work is already being done in that space.

140
00:17:25,661 --> 00:17:27,941
Even in Michigan, in our department,

141
00:17:27,941 --> 00:17:35,951
which is that MP Geoff McCullagh does some of the stuff in risk score estimations using non parametric or measurement methods.

142
00:17:36,191 --> 00:17:39,661
So that will be something that, you know, we can talk about for those who are interested.

143
00:17:41,621 --> 00:17:49,260
So for today's class, what we can do is. I'll take a step back, talk a bit about regression modeling, which I'm assuming.

144
00:17:49,261 --> 00:17:54,301
So if you have an idea for already in terms of the bio stats classes or the court class that you've done right.

145
00:17:54,511 --> 00:17:58,441
Essentially predicting something using an ordinary least squared regression.

146
00:17:58,921 --> 00:18:05,341
So today's class, I'll try to sort of establish that very basic parametric approach to predicting something.

147
00:18:05,971 --> 00:18:11,431
Do that in our SO after I lay out the problem that we want to answer it right.

148
00:18:11,701 --> 00:18:15,180
Using that we'll jump into an end to the watch.

149
00:18:15,181 --> 00:18:21,031
So that might be for some of you who I know took the database management class with me last semester.

150
00:18:21,031 --> 00:18:25,101
Right. It might be something you've seen before. So bear with me.

151
00:18:25,111 --> 00:18:27,691
But again, that's going to happen in the class, which is very mixed anyway. Right.

152
00:18:28,051 --> 00:18:32,191
But then we will try to run some of the regressions and I'll get some estimates from that.

153
00:18:32,491 --> 00:18:37,890
And the idea would be that by the end of today's class, we have done some regressions,

154
00:18:37,891 --> 00:18:43,321
we have integrated those outputs and identified some issues with those linear approaches.

155
00:18:43,951 --> 00:18:47,971
And once we have identified some issues with those linear approaches, right,

156
00:18:48,271 --> 00:18:53,281
that sets us the stage for applying some nonlinear non parametric approaches.

157
00:18:53,641 --> 00:18:58,741
And that's where machine learning, flexible machine learning enters the picture. So we'll get into that starting next week.

158
00:18:59,311 --> 00:19:02,881
Any questions with the framing? Why are we doing what we doing?

159
00:19:03,091 --> 00:19:08,351
Before I start jumping into it. Okay.

160
00:19:10,251 --> 00:19:16,611
So yeah just to sort of you know get everybody in is based on the NSA and this this plot was generated using AI.

161
00:19:16,621 --> 00:19:23,541
So I think the two odd folks I know who were in my class last semester so you know how we did this portrayed this was done using AI, right?

162
00:19:23,541 --> 00:19:30,410
I mean and we had it on 12 students who responded by and large, around 85, 90% of us don't have much of an AI proficiency.

163
00:19:30,411 --> 00:19:34,551
Totally understandable. Right. So I wanted to use this class, right.

164
00:19:34,731 --> 00:19:38,390
To get you to some of these being conversational.

165
00:19:38,391 --> 00:19:47,210
But I don't remember success for the way I think of success of about our in this class is not for you to become programmers if you end up becoming.

166
00:19:47,211 --> 00:19:50,571
That's awesome. Right. And that's what maybe we can do more courses later.

167
00:19:50,571 --> 00:19:55,731
Right. But here, just to sort of understand how the tool works, if you can sort of interact with that,

168
00:19:55,941 --> 00:19:59,781
run these chunks of code, but you understand what it does, right?

169
00:19:59,991 --> 00:20:03,231
You don't have reported from scratch. That should be good enough. Okay.

170
00:20:03,531 --> 00:20:08,300
So don't I mean, I know some of the comments you'll mention that of don't assume that,

171
00:20:08,301 --> 00:20:11,241
you know, are already in and I'm not assuming, you know, are already right.

172
00:20:11,241 --> 00:20:17,541
So that's where today's class is going to be, some sort of a let's get to speed on everybody being on the same page about this.

173
00:20:17,811 --> 00:20:23,541
Okay. All right. So coming back to the big data, sort of a theme, right.

174
00:20:24,231 --> 00:20:29,091
And I spoke a bit about it last class, what are some common big data or even data objectives?

175
00:20:29,091 --> 00:20:32,781
So to say? Right. One thing is I give you a let's say.

176
00:20:35,211 --> 00:20:40,701
If it's there, I give you a bunch of an opioid because that's the thing that you're working with, right?

177
00:20:40,701 --> 00:20:43,341
So I've given you a dataset on opioid usage rate.

178
00:20:43,611 --> 00:20:50,631
I've given you for each year the number of opioid states that have been prescribed, let's say, in regions across the country.

179
00:20:51,141 --> 00:20:58,161
That data also has, let's say, the number of opioid related deaths that have happened for each year for each region across the country.

180
00:20:58,491 --> 00:21:04,641
And you have the number of opioid scripts that were prescribed each year, each region across the country.

181
00:21:04,911 --> 00:21:08,331
Now, the the policy question being right, I mean, how do we relate?

182
00:21:08,511 --> 00:21:13,640
And this is a very simplistic example by just three variables. Nothing is an urban region, of course.

183
00:21:13,641 --> 00:21:17,781
Right. And maybe you just want to predict, okay, what's the rule?

184
00:21:18,111 --> 00:21:23,351
What's the time dependency of opioid deaths or opiate opioid prescriptions over time?

185
00:21:23,361 --> 00:21:30,411
Right. Can I predict, let's say based on the last ten years of data, what's the number of prescriptions that's going to be prescribed two years on?

186
00:21:30,921 --> 00:21:38,241
Or can I understand the relationship between the number of scripts that were prescribed to the number of excess deaths?

187
00:21:39,531 --> 00:21:42,890
Again, the problem of opioid overdose and deaths.

188
00:21:42,891 --> 00:21:47,061
Right. Is much more multi-dimensional than this simplistic example.

189
00:21:47,421 --> 00:21:52,601
But it just helps to sort of understand, right, how if I had some of these, what I call covariance right.

190
00:21:52,971 --> 00:21:58,191
Of scripts and the number of prescriptions that year itself.

191
00:21:58,191 --> 00:22:01,221
Right. How does that relate to the outcome of interest?

192
00:22:01,431 --> 00:22:08,181
And the outcome of interest here could be, you know, the number of opioid deaths or deaths related to opioids that have been recorded in the data.

193
00:22:08,751 --> 00:22:11,991
Okay. And that is a straightforward prediction problem. Right.

194
00:22:12,201 --> 00:22:13,821
I just want to predict this way.

195
00:22:13,851 --> 00:22:20,511
Let's call this outcome of interest, the number of opioid deaths as Y based on these X's or these variables that I'm observing.

196
00:22:20,931 --> 00:22:26,441
Okay, everybody with me and what I'm saying and you all have done some version of that in your boss stats class,

197
00:22:26,451 --> 00:22:30,291
so there'd be a bunch of assumptions I'll be making when I teach this content, right?

198
00:22:30,291 --> 00:22:34,371
Especially on the stat spot. But if I'm wrong in the assumptions, please call me out.

199
00:22:34,791 --> 00:22:39,731
Okay. And then there is there's a prediction question that's there.

200
00:22:39,741 --> 00:22:48,171
Right. The other question is a causal question. What's the effect of changing, let's say, the number of prescriptions on the number of deaths?

201
00:22:48,921 --> 00:22:51,501
Now, this is not exactly a prediction question.

202
00:22:51,981 --> 00:22:56,881
This is that is it's a very nuance prediction question because of the cause and effect thing comes into being.

203
00:22:57,201 --> 00:23:05,090
And that's something that's very, very important for you as even policy researchers, as health care practitioners, as consultants.

204
00:23:05,091 --> 00:23:11,720
Right. When when you say that. Okay. Exchanges by something and why changes by something and use that model.

205
00:23:11,721 --> 00:23:22,161
Right. Who's going to close the door say. And we'll get into the more details.

206
00:23:22,181 --> 00:23:27,491
But a very important distinction to make is what is causation and what is correlation.

207
00:23:28,001 --> 00:23:31,990
Has anybody heard this sort of cliche in in research?

208
00:23:31,991 --> 00:23:36,581
But oh, very true. And oftentimes, right. Where correlation is not causation.

209
00:23:37,331 --> 00:23:39,880
Right. And that's something to be very conscious of.

210
00:23:39,881 --> 00:23:45,941
And we'll talk a bit about that when we come to the causal animal parts of the of the other of the cause.

211
00:23:46,211 --> 00:23:50,411
But today we talk all about prediction, essentially correlations or associations.

212
00:23:50,771 --> 00:24:00,611
So what you have is changes in the changes in the number of opioid prescriptions are associated with let's see, the number of deaths.

213
00:24:01,031 --> 00:24:09,191
I'm not seeing that. Okay. And and the closing statement, on the other hand, would have been, if I change the number of opioid prescriptions by ten.

214
00:24:09,491 --> 00:24:13,661
There are three more deaths. And that's a much stronger statement that we're making.

215
00:24:13,661 --> 00:24:17,081
Right. And the onus for proving that is much, much higher.

216
00:24:17,471 --> 00:24:23,051
So much of the research in economics, econometrics, the research that I do write is tries to meet that bar.

217
00:24:23,261 --> 00:24:31,181
Can we see that with a strong level of confidence that changing X by 10% leads to outcomes by 5%?

218
00:24:31,421 --> 00:24:34,271
And that's a very strong statement to make. Right. So we'll come to that later.

219
00:24:34,511 --> 00:24:37,841
But remember, when most of the most of the time even talk about regression, right.

220
00:24:38,441 --> 00:24:42,461
It's more often than not association or correlations that you're mentioning here.

221
00:24:42,761 --> 00:24:51,651
Okay. So these are two sort of predictions on causation estimation, right, are two things that people often do with big data.

222
00:24:52,821 --> 00:24:56,961
But the other thing that you also do, right, I mean, you have tons of data right now. The example that I've given you.

223
00:24:57,201 --> 00:25:02,780
I just told you three variables for you that you're I told you the number of overwrite scripts and the outcome itself,

224
00:25:02,781 --> 00:25:08,150
which is the number of opioid related deaths. Right. But more often than not, you have thousands of variables.

225
00:25:08,151 --> 00:25:12,201
Right. You might have all the zip code level variables.

226
00:25:12,201 --> 00:25:16,281
You might have income and so on. Right. And some of these variables are important.

227
00:25:16,581 --> 00:25:24,201
Some of those variables are just noise, right? How does your model throw some of those variables out and just pick up the variables that matter most?

228
00:25:24,501 --> 00:25:27,891
We do a bunch of that next class. But again, something for you to keep in mind.

229
00:25:28,401 --> 00:25:32,161
Okay. That again is also about dimension reduction.

230
00:25:32,161 --> 00:25:36,721
And remember last time I talked about when I use the word dimensions, variables,

231
00:25:36,781 --> 00:25:40,621
covariates and features, more of them are almost always interchangeable.

232
00:25:40,701 --> 00:25:44,061
Okay, so if we get confused, just in short, that's what we think about.

233
00:25:46,201 --> 00:25:53,371
So let's come to regression, which is I'm assuming we have seen a version of this in a previous class who hasn't seen this equation before.

234
00:25:53,371 --> 00:25:55,411
And so if you hadn't seen I'm happy to talk a bit about it.

235
00:25:58,461 --> 00:26:06,261
So we have seen what why it is right this outcome variable of interest and you have alpha which is the barometer which is the X intercept, right?

236
00:26:06,561 --> 00:26:10,851
And you have the beta which is the coefficient of interest perhaps.

237
00:26:10,851 --> 00:26:12,861
Right. And epsilon is the milestone.

238
00:26:13,281 --> 00:26:20,361
So this is a square in a regression, a basic linear line that we sort of, you know, try to generate, seeing what our data sort of looks like.

239
00:26:20,721 --> 00:26:24,831
And y in our case could be the number of opioid deaths, right?

240
00:26:25,281 --> 00:26:29,360
X's here could be anything that I'm capturing in my particular case that I talked about.

241
00:26:29,361 --> 00:26:32,901
Right, is that you're it's the number of scripts, right?

242
00:26:33,111 --> 00:26:38,481
It could be those things that my outcome, which I hypothesize is dependent upon.

243
00:26:38,871 --> 00:26:43,250
Okay. As far as the intercept barometer, it's more about value of value.

244
00:26:43,251 --> 00:26:47,541
When X is equal to zero, you'll often times note that it's meaningless.

245
00:26:47,541 --> 00:26:53,041
Let's even think about Gage. Right? There's not a zero. But you can standardize and do something about that.

246
00:26:53,041 --> 00:26:59,241
You can talk about that later. But this is how a typical Orwell's regression equation is written, right?

247
00:26:59,511 --> 00:27:05,991
And we are interested from a policy all from a data on this point of view, right, to estimate these guys.

248
00:27:06,661 --> 00:27:10,071
We all find the beta parameters, right. Because.

249
00:27:11,861 --> 00:27:15,701
The way you want to think about what barometers and estimates are.

250
00:27:15,701 --> 00:27:18,761
Right? You have the whole world. You have the whole universe, right.

251
00:27:19,181 --> 00:27:24,011
And that is a relationship that governs let's say let's call, let's say one variable, let's say.

252
00:27:24,671 --> 00:27:27,131
Why is the number of opioid deaths?

253
00:27:27,531 --> 00:27:35,860
And X is the the European that you have been prescribed right on your one year, two year three and year four and so on.

254
00:27:35,861 --> 00:27:39,041
Right? I live at the universe.

255
00:27:39,041 --> 00:27:43,751
I have this veto set in stone that that is a relationship of time.

256
00:27:43,781 --> 00:27:48,940
Right. With how, how time time is rated with the number of deaths that happened.

257
00:27:48,941 --> 00:27:52,471
Right. And I want to figure this out from the data that I have now.

258
00:27:52,481 --> 00:27:56,861
Remember, the data that I have is a snapshot of this universe of do that.

259
00:27:56,861 --> 00:28:03,070
Right. I do not have the full data by design, write measurement issues or see what what you have, right?

260
00:28:03,071 --> 00:28:05,561
So you're always constrained by sample size and so on.

261
00:28:05,981 --> 00:28:13,241
So in my sample size I'll have, let's say thousand 400 years of data or ten years of data for ten different states.

262
00:28:13,241 --> 00:28:16,991
Right. That's what let's say I have an error.

263
00:28:16,991 --> 00:28:19,451
Time is something which record we don't see.

264
00:28:20,291 --> 00:28:25,571
So anything that you have in the order, your outcome that's measured right there could be measurement error,

265
00:28:25,751 --> 00:28:29,681
there could be other fluctuations that are there. We don't know what the error dominates.

266
00:28:30,131 --> 00:28:33,731
Okay, everybody with me on this chart. Okay, perfect.

267
00:28:35,871 --> 00:28:41,061
What I want to estimate from the data are these terms essentially alpha.

268
00:28:41,091 --> 00:28:45,201
What have here is an estimate because I'd never know what the ground truth is.

269
00:28:45,441 --> 00:28:51,770
It's humanly impossible. Unless I have infinite amounts of data. I cannot know what the ground truth is, which is I'll find another ground truth.

270
00:28:51,771 --> 00:28:54,800
Right. But I can estimate that using these models.

271
00:28:54,801 --> 00:29:00,981
Right. What, what, how close they are to the, what we call in demo, the oracle.

272
00:29:00,981 --> 00:29:04,371
Right. How can we come as close to the Oracle as possible?

273
00:29:04,521 --> 00:29:10,041
And these are our estimates. Okay. And what you're predicting is the white hat.

274
00:29:10,581 --> 00:29:16,851
So I want to predict the number of so the data that we have right now is this beta from 2009 to 2020.

275
00:29:17,131 --> 00:29:22,101
Okay. The number of Y, that's the pop up and the number of years that have happened.

276
00:29:22,101 --> 00:29:26,541
Right. I want to predict, let's say for 2021, the not the number of deaths that happened.

277
00:29:26,901 --> 00:29:30,221
So I don't know the Y had that. I do know that X there.

278
00:29:30,231 --> 00:29:34,771
Right. That's 2021. And everybody feels. Okay.

279
00:29:35,061 --> 00:29:38,781
Just like. Okay. So. Yeah. That's okay.

280
00:29:38,961 --> 00:29:44,691
Okay. Okay. We'll just do this, like we got you off that so I can automate that on another board in an easier.

281
00:29:44,691 --> 00:29:49,551
That was almost like you know, maybe he said.

282
00:29:57,801 --> 00:30:07,031
Acknowledge this guy. Okay. I had this x meter.

283
00:30:07,691 --> 00:30:19,331
Okay. So essentially what I'm doing is I have all the data that I have is from 2000 and then 2020 OC all the X's that I have.

284
00:30:19,721 --> 00:30:28,181
These are all the X's right? And I observe for all these 11 years what the corresponding Y is, the number of deaths that have happened.

285
00:30:28,211 --> 00:30:34,121
Okay. So I have the Y and the X for that. I want to predict what's the Y had for 2021.

286
00:30:34,811 --> 00:30:38,171
So I know the Expo 2021. Right. Of the 11th year to the 12th year.

287
00:30:38,531 --> 00:30:42,461
I do not know the y hat. That's something that I want to predict based on my.

288
00:30:42,671 --> 00:30:47,251
And this is the model that I use. Right. To predict my 2021 data.

289
00:30:47,291 --> 00:30:55,781
Okay. Going to in 2021 number of deaths. So using the 2020 2010 to 2020 data that I have, the vice and the X's both right.

290
00:30:56,171 --> 00:31:01,361
I figured these guys out of the hat and B the hat, which are the parameter estimates.

291
00:31:01,361 --> 00:31:07,210
Okay. Now once I have that, I just plug that into the 2021 value and figure and see that,

292
00:31:07,211 --> 00:31:12,731
okay, this is what I estimate that the 2021 deaths are going to be with me on this.

293
00:31:13,931 --> 00:31:20,441
Everybody with me on this. Okay. This is something that we do all the time. This is something that you've done in your regression class before.

294
00:31:20,711 --> 00:31:24,941
But this is good to know because so much of the matter is just this.

295
00:31:25,891 --> 00:31:30,121
What what is there in Emma is this guy remains the same on the left side.

296
00:31:30,571 --> 00:31:35,021
On the right side. We change what we have. So what do we change in that?

297
00:31:35,041 --> 00:31:41,401
Let's talk a bit about it. So a quick onset of, you know, a background about how does regression work.

298
00:31:42,361 --> 00:31:51,600
So using the 2010 to 2020 data where I had the YS, which is the number of deaths and I figured out what the Y hat is,

299
00:31:51,601 --> 00:32:00,061
right, which is the predictive value from my model. I essentially want to minimize the sum of the squared errors because y minus my hat.

300
00:32:01,141 --> 00:32:04,681
So this is going to be a confusing image for a minute, but bear with me.

301
00:32:04,681 --> 00:32:10,591
Okay. So these blue points that you see here, these are the actual observed data points.

302
00:32:11,011 --> 00:32:15,871
So that essentially is that for a value of X, this is what I'm observing in the data for Y, okay?

303
00:32:16,171 --> 00:32:25,171
Y one, y two and so on. This line that I have used these points to estimate this is my model.

304
00:32:25,531 --> 00:32:33,631
This is my prediction, essentially for each value of, let's say x one here, x one is the observed value that we had was y one.

305
00:32:34,321 --> 00:32:37,861
The predicted value was this point on the line here.

306
00:32:38,491 --> 00:32:46,241
Okay. And the difference between what I actually observe and what I estimate the y hat here.

307
00:32:46,261 --> 00:32:49,831
Right. That is my editor. And that's pretty intuitive, right?

308
00:32:50,401 --> 00:32:58,391
Ideally. Okay. And I'm jumping the gun here. Right. Ideally, your model should have been like this coming from here, here, here, here, here.

309
00:32:58,951 --> 00:33:01,981
Right. That would have been. Let's say it's having zero error.

310
00:33:03,331 --> 00:33:04,031
Would that okay.

311
00:33:04,051 --> 00:33:10,921
And I don't want to sort of, you know, jump ten guns here because are going to come to all of that awesome things in the next few sessions.

312
00:33:11,461 --> 00:33:15,091
But that would have been from this perspective, no error.

313
00:33:15,301 --> 00:33:21,631
But that's not what we are going get. We want a generalizable model, which I can predict even on future data as well.

314
00:33:22,171 --> 00:33:30,181
So this is the best model that I have and that is generated in this Euler's format, which is the ordinary squared aggression,

315
00:33:30,511 --> 00:33:36,511
because you're making a bunch of assumptions here, you're making an assumption that this is a linear sort of, you know, model.

316
00:33:36,811 --> 00:33:44,581
That's why you have a line here in the simplest example, right? It has assumptions about how your ever done this is the error time, right?

317
00:33:44,581 --> 00:33:45,931
After all, why am I this way?

318
00:33:45,931 --> 00:33:54,301
A hat is distributed statistically, so to say, right, this is important to know because these assumptions constrain on modeling.

319
00:33:55,051 --> 00:33:59,371
Because of these assumptions, we have a very neat looking line, which is great.

320
00:33:59,371 --> 00:34:04,081
It gives me at least an estimate of what my corresponding number of deaths is.

321
00:34:04,291 --> 00:34:10,260
But each year the challenges it might not exactly be the closer to the ground truth as we would want it.

322
00:34:10,261 --> 00:34:15,131
Right. But that's the price we pay. The price we pay for getting something which is very interpretable.

323
00:34:15,511 --> 00:34:20,131
We know this at home. We know this alpha tone is a pretty good rule.

324
00:34:20,371 --> 00:34:24,361
And we get what the number of deaths are going to be with me on this.

325
00:34:26,041 --> 00:34:30,401
And this is the approach we have been essentially using what's called ordinarily squared.

326
00:34:30,631 --> 00:34:35,491
We are minimizing the squared of the error tone to figure out what the alpha and the beta comes up.

327
00:34:35,521 --> 00:34:40,711
So essentially, what is the alpha beta values that minimize this dom here?

328
00:34:41,101 --> 00:34:44,730
And you use essentially all the sort of, you know, statistical methodology.

329
00:34:44,731 --> 00:34:52,411
It happens in the in the backend and you get your alpha and beta estimates when you do a question to you is when

330
00:34:52,411 --> 00:34:57,060
you were doing something like this in your stats class last semester or your first semester when you were here,

331
00:34:57,061 --> 00:35:00,121
right. What's the tool your use? Was that Excel?

332
00:35:00,121 --> 00:35:06,121
Was that Excel? So you essentially had your Xs and Ys and you put a line on that.

333
00:35:06,481 --> 00:35:13,201
Is that right? Okay. So you do exactly that, actually. So you excel has internally does all the statistical sort of machinery inside.

334
00:35:13,201 --> 00:35:16,461
Right. And gives you a line which is what exactly we are doing.

335
00:35:16,471 --> 00:35:24,471
You. Okay. So as the mission gives us the parameter estimate, which is the alpha beta.

336
00:35:25,161 --> 00:35:35,271
Now did you happen to cover in your in your stars glasses any of the hypothesis testing essentially what the standard errors are of your estimates?

337
00:35:35,301 --> 00:35:42,501
Was that something that you guys covered? So you're aware of, you know, getting parameter estimates of Alpha Beta HUD in this equation.

338
00:35:42,501 --> 00:35:47,391
Right. And what the specific standard errors are, whether or not they are statistically significant.

339
00:35:47,691 --> 00:35:52,730
That's wonderful. That's great. Right. Okay. So we have that we get a lot of perimeter estimates.

340
00:35:52,731 --> 00:35:56,300
Right. And we know about what's statistical significance,

341
00:35:56,301 --> 00:36:01,491
whether or not each of the parameters are statistically significant to 95%, which is the norm that we use.

342
00:36:01,491 --> 00:36:06,801
Right. And we see that. Okay. You know, if let's say Beta Hot said it's pretty significant to 95%.

343
00:36:07,071 --> 00:36:13,131
We know that there is a correlation of X with like based on this model and these assumptions that we make,

344
00:36:14,661 --> 00:36:18,801
how do we interpret what are what what this model gives us?

345
00:36:19,611 --> 00:36:30,021
So let's say if I give you all if I give you the number of deaths is equal to a thousand plus of 500 X.

346
00:36:30,471 --> 00:36:33,651
Let me put that on the thing you have, which is going to be zero.

347
00:36:34,701 --> 00:36:51,211
So. If I tell you that's Bets, which is a prediction, you're right, is equal to thousand plus.

348
00:36:53,361 --> 00:36:56,701
500. Dean.

349
00:36:56,951 --> 00:37:01,811
And Dean is one, two, three, four, five. For each additional year from 2000.

350
00:37:02,381 --> 00:37:08,501
From 2009. Assuming that that's what we generate, this is what you're getting from your modeling.

351
00:37:09,281 --> 00:37:12,811
So can somebody help me and understand what is, first of all.

352
00:37:12,851 --> 00:37:18,101
Simple question. What is alpha? What is beta in this in this equation that I've given here?

353
00:37:18,111 --> 00:37:28,771
Right. And what does beta. So we have y which is this is equal to alpha.

354
00:37:29,251 --> 00:37:33,631
Yeah. Which is thousand plus? Yeah. So can I start speaking?

355
00:37:40,871 --> 00:37:49,501
Okay. So the low hanging fruit for us what's also what's been. I suppose a thousand and better is perfect.

356
00:37:49,531 --> 00:37:52,831
Okay, great. So now tell me. Okay, that's. That's wonderful. Thank you for that.

357
00:37:53,101 --> 00:37:57,121
So, what does 500 mean here? It's the slopes of her.

358
00:37:57,121 --> 00:38:00,991
Every change in one y goes 500 and X.

359
00:38:01,321 --> 00:38:04,571
Yeah, whatever. I know. So that's exactly right.

360
00:38:04,591 --> 00:38:08,701
Right. So this is the slope of this line that you have here, right? So the line that I showed you here.

361
00:38:08,701 --> 00:38:12,571
Right, the slope of this line is 500. But what does that slope me?

362
00:38:12,961 --> 00:38:17,341
That means that for every one, you want an increase in time of a year, right?

363
00:38:17,611 --> 00:38:21,031
So for every additional year, you have 500 more.

364
00:38:21,031 --> 00:38:27,931
That's right. It doesn't mean that if you increase your by one, you get 500 deaths.

365
00:38:28,741 --> 00:38:35,961
Why does it not mean that? And anyone telling me. Is there a definitive statement that I just make?

366
00:38:37,961 --> 00:38:44,621
The full statement is for every increase in the year here at the rate of 500 more deaths.

367
00:38:45,651 --> 00:38:54,051
That's the number one statement to us. If you increase the number, increase the yield by one, you get 500 units.

368
00:39:02,431 --> 00:39:05,590
It's okay. You will learn otherwise. Come on.

369
00:39:05,591 --> 00:39:10,531
It's like it's set up. As the question makes sense.

370
00:39:10,531 --> 00:39:14,191
Do you do you see the difference at all? Do those two sentences sound different to you?

371
00:39:14,521 --> 00:39:18,151
No. No. Okay. Okay. That's a good. And thank you for the honesty, Ray.

372
00:39:18,481 --> 00:39:21,901
Maybe I want to read this. The two statements again, stable number one.

373
00:39:21,901 --> 00:39:28,201
Right. For every one year increase in the time period.

374
00:39:28,201 --> 00:39:32,161
Right there is there are 500 more that's happening.

375
00:39:33,221 --> 00:39:37,931
Okay. For every one year increase that if 500 more that's happening.

376
00:39:40,141 --> 00:39:44,551
Second statement is this When I change, when I go and increase the number of years,

377
00:39:45,211 --> 00:39:49,201
I get more and more debts, I get 500 more debts, but I increase the number of years.

378
00:39:50,101 --> 00:39:54,000
Yes. So in the first statement, it's 500 every year.

379
00:39:54,001 --> 00:40:00,901
But the second statement, are you saying your one is 500, your two is a thousand years, three is 1500 or so.

380
00:40:01,261 --> 00:40:05,550
So this might be because my ex is kind of annoying and confusing.

381
00:40:05,551 --> 00:40:10,941
Right? That's why this might be not coming in easily. Right. Let me let me change that again and give that frame to you again, right?

382
00:40:10,951 --> 00:40:15,211
Yes. Is it because the second statement is including the help of a thousand?

383
00:40:15,631 --> 00:40:26,821
No, no, no. That's not the case. So, yes, I think maybe your second statement reveals a causal relationship between of between the year and the days.

384
00:40:27,241 --> 00:40:31,111
Exactly. I think in the second statement.

385
00:40:31,111 --> 00:40:40,401
You mean the. I mean, they increased Man of the Year leads to more deaths, but actually they just have a relationship.

386
00:40:40,791 --> 00:40:45,771
Absolutely. That's exactly that's exactly right. Thank you for that. What's in him? It's a new Beijing Zoo.

387
00:40:45,951 --> 00:40:48,500
Is it Beijing? Is that right? Okay, perfect. So, yeah.

388
00:40:48,501 --> 00:40:54,171
And I think a part of that confusion also might have been because of my said, if you don't use of that, you're here.

389
00:40:54,171 --> 00:40:58,581
Right. Because that might be a bit confusing. Let me use a new X variable here.

390
00:40:59,001 --> 00:41:03,561
So let's say I was measuring the relationship between deaths and the number of opioid scripts.

391
00:41:03,771 --> 00:41:13,881
Okay. So assuming here you had a. Any scripts other than writing.

392
00:41:13,911 --> 00:41:22,211
Right. So statement one would be. An increase in the number of scripts by one gives me 500 more deaths.

393
00:41:22,391 --> 00:41:27,401
Okay, so let's find it in scripts and in that might be easy to understand, right?

394
00:41:27,821 --> 00:41:32,841
So for every thousand increase in the number of scripts, you have 500 more deaths.

395
00:41:33,251 --> 00:41:40,421
That's statement one. Statement two is when I give 500 more scripts, I get thousand more deaths.

396
00:41:41,321 --> 00:41:46,781
So there's I think what Bijan says might be more might make more sense, because the first one is just,

397
00:41:46,781 --> 00:41:49,871
you know, from the data, what I see is that is an associational relationship.

398
00:41:50,381 --> 00:41:55,721
But every 500 that is a that is, you know, a corresponding we don't know which direction the causality flows.

399
00:41:55,991 --> 00:42:03,311
We don't even know if it is a causal relationship or not. Second one is a very strong statement that saying that policymakers that you know what,

400
00:42:03,551 --> 00:42:08,741
because increasing the number of Swiss by 500, that's leading to an increase in thousand deaths.

401
00:42:10,011 --> 00:42:15,021
Does that make sense to everyone? Not something to be careful about, but that's not what we are saying here.

402
00:42:15,261 --> 00:42:20,331
We're seeing the very light, simple one. First, for a big increase in 500 scripts.

403
00:42:20,481 --> 00:42:24,050
For 1000 scripts each in the data.

404
00:42:24,051 --> 00:42:32,151
Right. 500 more. That's that's how you want to sort of, you know, sort of interpret this bit about us.

405
00:42:32,571 --> 00:42:35,810
And this is an important thing. I mean, don't be surprised if you ask these questions.

406
00:42:35,811 --> 00:42:38,961
I won't be asking you questions on here on this random force for me.

407
00:42:39,291 --> 00:42:42,771
I want to be asking questions to you that, okay, this is what the random fighters gives me.

408
00:42:43,101 --> 00:42:48,351
What do these results mean? So if you have any confusions about this, please raise your hand and ask these questions.

409
00:42:48,831 --> 00:42:53,371
Okay. So what Beijing said was the second part, right?

410
00:42:53,701 --> 00:42:58,111
I'm not talking about the cause. It infects angel effect, where it benitez is about the effect of X and Y.

411
00:42:58,321 --> 00:43:05,310
I'm not doing that because to see that statement, there have to be a bunch of other assumptions or the setting has to fulfill that.

412
00:43:05,311 --> 00:43:06,841
And we'll talk a bit about that later.

413
00:43:07,981 --> 00:43:14,071
But even about this, this thing that we just did, this basic linear equation, this basic line we just constructed.

414
00:43:14,071 --> 00:43:18,541
Right? Even that model relies on a million assumptions.

415
00:43:18,871 --> 00:43:24,181
It assumes that there is a linear relationship, that there is a line which captures the relationship between acceptable.

416
00:43:24,481 --> 00:43:32,611
And that is a strong statement. It assumes that your noise is distributed normally, randomly, is independent.

417
00:43:32,911 --> 00:43:39,481
And those are assumptions which can be tested to some extent and can be oftentimes, you know, then there are ways to sort of test that.

418
00:43:40,411 --> 00:43:46,911
And that can be problematic. Okay. So that's where we stand with with what legal regressions are.

419
00:43:48,191 --> 00:43:53,021
One more thing that you will see is one objective, and I'm gonna come to the example in a bit, right?

420
00:43:53,681 --> 00:43:59,021
Because one thing that we are minimizing here, as I mentioned, right, is the sum of these squares, right?

421
00:43:59,051 --> 00:44:07,271
Your squared error, that's a good metric to have. Which model gives me the least sort of, you know, sum of squared errors.

422
00:44:07,661 --> 00:44:11,411
And if there's a model which does that, I'm going to go for that model right now.

423
00:44:11,411 --> 00:44:16,541
I showed you just one model, this linear regression model. Right. And this is what I observe in the data.

424
00:44:16,991 --> 00:44:20,771
This is what I estimate from the data. And I'm squishing this as much as I can.

425
00:44:21,461 --> 00:44:27,521
So if I have three or four models that I'm comparing and I go for the model, which gives me the lowest of this value.

426
00:44:28,271 --> 00:44:32,621
So today we talk about regressions, but tomorrow or the next week, right?

427
00:44:32,831 --> 00:44:36,791
We talk about other models and see how they compare against the linear regression model.

428
00:44:36,791 --> 00:44:42,550
Right. In giving this estimate to you, which is also a thing that's called denote,

429
00:44:42,551 --> 00:44:47,281
is the mean squared error, okay, mean square, which is what we would be sort of talking about.

430
00:44:48,221 --> 00:44:57,651
Okay. So this is the deal that will be working with today, which is the opioids and mortality data, right, that I have.

431
00:44:58,221 --> 00:45:06,021
This is a dataset which I'll upload on canvas during the break, right where I have the use of the number of scripts, of the number of overdose deaths.

432
00:45:06,021 --> 00:45:12,611
Right. And I have the number of opioid deaths. And we sort of figured out, you know, some relationship building to the end of this class.

433
00:45:15,881 --> 00:45:20,801
Now what I'm going to do is I'm going to take a break from the slides and come to our.

434
00:45:21,941 --> 00:45:29,051
Because I think that's where today we can spend a fair bit of time until 650 introducing some hour,

435
00:45:29,111 --> 00:45:34,451
come back, do some more ad right and then give the last one hour to you to work on this one.

436
00:45:34,571 --> 00:45:37,541
Let's see. Let's see what to what extent similar to. Okay.

437
00:45:39,261 --> 00:45:47,301
So what I'm going to do is, first of all, let me just go to canvas and upload this thing for you so that you also the analysis to this identify.

438
00:46:22,911 --> 00:46:31,441
Course. So you should be getting.

439
00:46:31,471 --> 00:46:35,941
Or if you go to canvas, right, you will have.

440
00:46:38,681 --> 00:46:41,681
Module two activated. So if you want to sort of click on that one.

441
00:46:44,531 --> 00:46:48,041
I mean, doesn't have the R files yet. Just bear with me.

442
00:46:58,461 --> 00:47:05,191
Okay. So you should have the army following. So let me sort of days.

443
00:47:05,521 --> 00:47:10,231
So this is this is the studio council, by the way, do all of you will see this on your systems?

444
00:47:10,831 --> 00:47:14,071
You have something like this or you don't have a file open. So that's fine.

445
00:47:14,491 --> 00:47:23,231
What you want to do is go to canvas download of the The Artemis file, which is session to underscore our underscore lecture lot.

446
00:47:23,521 --> 00:47:28,561
Right? If you download that file and if you click that file open, it's going to open in our studio.

447
00:47:29,011 --> 00:47:35,551
Okay. So. And now I'm going to quickly just let this guy and get get.

448
00:47:37,541 --> 00:47:42,640
I hope this works. When I do this.

449
00:47:42,641 --> 00:48:03,201
If you have any questions, please feel free to ask me. Well.

450
00:48:08,461 --> 00:48:12,911
Yeah. It's going to be something. Okay, I'll do it.

451
00:48:14,431 --> 00:48:18,411
Okay. Okay, so let's come to this for now.

452
00:48:18,421 --> 00:48:25,740
But while you while you do that, I will sort of keep flipping the switching between the steam file and that Artemis

453
00:48:25,741 --> 00:48:29,821
file because I essentially generated this these slides using the are fine.

454
00:48:29,851 --> 00:48:34,111
Okay. And that's again, the beauty of what you can use off to generate presentations.

455
00:48:34,111 --> 00:48:37,321
You can use auto generate reports, you can use that to generate web apps.

456
00:48:37,681 --> 00:48:40,710
And some of you end up liking it after this class.

457
00:48:40,711 --> 00:48:45,361
I hope you don't hate. I hope you like. Our authorities are indifferent because I feel I did the terrible job.

458
00:48:45,361 --> 00:48:48,991
But the art is super flexible and you can use that for a bunch of things, right?

459
00:48:49,291 --> 00:48:54,271
And I mean, if you take the other class with me, which is the database management and visualization class,

460
00:48:54,691 --> 00:48:58,231
that's where you learn about these things that are way more detail than we can possibly do in this class.

461
00:48:58,361 --> 00:49:01,871
Okay. So this is subjective.

462
00:49:02,051 --> 00:49:06,821
Objective is meant to be a super crashy crash and then crash scores and are given the time that we have.

463
00:49:06,821 --> 00:49:12,941
Right. And again, it's makes a bunch of assumptions about some of the stats stuff that you already know.

464
00:49:12,941 --> 00:49:17,621
Right. But would introduce you what would various things with an R is right.

465
00:49:18,191 --> 00:49:22,721
So one thing that all of you will have does everybody have this this thing here?

466
00:49:23,621 --> 00:49:27,701
You'll have this one open in front of your radio. Get that file right. So this is your art.

467
00:49:28,061 --> 00:49:32,741
Our studio, which is the integrated development environment. So art is this programing language.

468
00:49:32,981 --> 00:49:37,211
Our studio is something that's there, which is an interface between you and I.

469
00:49:37,451 --> 00:49:42,731
Makes it very user friendly to have like, what are scripts? You can type in scripts, you can debug them, you can run them.

470
00:49:42,881 --> 00:49:48,371
It makes the life easier for you. This entire thing is divided into four sections that you can see, right?

471
00:49:49,001 --> 00:49:52,271
Should I turn the lights off or something? Can you see this? Okay.

472
00:49:52,331 --> 00:49:57,881
Okay. So if you see that after two sections, the four sections in this entire page, right on our studio that you have.

473
00:49:58,571 --> 00:50:02,771
This is where it's called the source or where I enter my script.

474
00:50:03,221 --> 00:50:08,861
So essentially I can type a bunch of instructions. Right, and execute them all at the same time.

475
00:50:09,281 --> 00:50:13,431
Okay. That's what a script is there for. That's where the source is. Therefore, this.

476
00:50:13,451 --> 00:50:19,061
What do you have here? This guy here, right, is what's called the console here.

477
00:50:19,091 --> 00:50:23,951
I can essentially interact with our at one stage of time, I can send a specific command.

478
00:50:24,251 --> 00:50:29,351
It gets executed instantly when I try something here that doesn't get executed instantly.

479
00:50:29,621 --> 00:50:33,781
That gets stored in the script. I got to run that script later. There are advantages to that, right?

480
00:50:33,791 --> 00:50:41,890
You can run long, long commands and functions and run them all at the same time and sort of go get a coffee while here.

481
00:50:41,891 --> 00:50:50,081
You have to sort of, you know, interact God one step at a time. This here is your environment, which essentially is all the data sets, all the tables,

482
00:50:50,081 --> 00:50:53,560
all the variables that you have stored while functioning while working.

483
00:50:53,561 --> 00:50:57,651
Without that all is reflected here. Because I haven't gotten that yet.

484
00:50:57,671 --> 00:51:02,890
That's why this is empty. Here is on the final plot is where you have your plots.

485
00:51:02,891 --> 00:51:05,971
You have any help that you will sort of have a question to.

486
00:51:06,311 --> 00:51:10,451
And you type that on the console here. That's where all of that pops up.

487
00:51:10,601 --> 00:51:19,561
Okay. Just just be aware of how this sort of flows. What I uploaded on canvas was what's called the right.

488
00:51:19,651 --> 00:51:24,621
It's one like an hour marked on file. So that's, again, a script that you're given, right?

489
00:51:24,631 --> 00:51:30,091
And with all the instructions that how to execute the code set of instructions, right.

490
00:51:30,481 --> 00:51:33,511
And when I mixed that file or executed that file.

491
00:51:33,511 --> 00:51:39,781
Right, it gives me a nice slight slide, slide deck, an edge to the file and that that I use for my classes.

492
00:51:39,781 --> 00:51:45,001
Right. I can also use the same automatic file are marked down to generate a PDF report for me.

493
00:51:45,241 --> 00:51:52,021
In fact, in the other class we make students write that entire read analysis project in R and they generate reports based out of that.

494
00:51:52,411 --> 00:51:55,551
I also generate presentations out of this as well. Right, which is what I do in this class.

495
00:51:55,571 --> 00:52:00,151
So just to give you an example of that. So let's come here.

496
00:52:00,961 --> 00:52:06,121
So our model, which is the automatic file, right? It's one of the with all the functions.

497
00:52:06,121 --> 00:52:09,681
Right. As I mentioned, one of the advantages of our is it's open source.

498
00:52:10,051 --> 00:52:13,151
Unlike other tools that we have, right where you're going to be a license fee,

499
00:52:13,151 --> 00:52:18,451
you know that issues with transport, ability and stuff everybody in the world can access all for free.

500
00:52:19,081 --> 00:52:24,151
There are forums that you can ask questions on and it's like crowdsourced Wikipedia sort of a model, right?

501
00:52:24,451 --> 00:52:27,541
And is remarkably friendly once you the learning curve and it should be steep.

502
00:52:27,871 --> 00:52:32,701
But once you get into that sort of, you know, what's the ecosystem, then you're pretty much hooked on to it.

503
00:52:32,971 --> 00:52:37,431
Okay. And the way these packages work within are.

504
00:52:37,441 --> 00:52:42,270
Right. So you can imagine you can run individual commands and functions and odd.

505
00:52:42,271 --> 00:52:49,621
Right. But of things that's as you know, there are preset methods that have already been developed for the last 50, 40 years.

506
00:52:49,621 --> 00:52:54,051
Right. You if you are a statistician today or if you're a machine learning modeler.

507
00:52:54,061 --> 00:52:59,161
Right. You don't have to write every function from scratch. There are researchers that are scientists.

508
00:52:59,161 --> 00:53:03,451
Statisticians have all done that work for you and they have developed what are these packages?

509
00:53:03,751 --> 00:53:08,071
You load that package into R and then you just run functions which have already been developed for you.

510
00:53:08,251 --> 00:53:16,171
So for example, the linear regression model we just talked about right in Excel, what you do is you have your sheet either X column, Y column, right?

511
00:53:16,411 --> 00:53:22,951
You go to the tool kit, which is let's say you generate a line towards the line until something similar happens with that as well.

512
00:53:23,981 --> 00:53:29,211
So you have your data set with your taxes and ways you upload the data into.

513
00:53:29,861 --> 00:53:35,170
You use a function which has been developed by you developed by some researchers long ago, right.

514
00:53:35,171 --> 00:53:43,301
Called Elem, which is a linear model. Right into that model, you pass your ex, you pass your Y, you had your data and you get the results.

515
00:53:43,961 --> 00:53:49,841
The good thing is not getting all the ex, the beta values, the alpha values, the standard errors and what to make out of that.

516
00:53:50,411 --> 00:53:53,651
So that's one example of a function which is part of a package.

517
00:53:54,371 --> 00:54:00,041
Makes sense. We will again talk about that once we start instance instantiating an example exemplifying it.

518
00:54:00,281 --> 00:54:02,531
That's going to get way easier in case you haven't seen this before.

519
00:54:04,091 --> 00:54:08,201
So Armageddon is a convenient way of writing reports for the Bettencourt analysis.

520
00:54:08,591 --> 00:54:14,611
It's again easy for readers to see what you're doing right. They are coaching just to essentially what happened is not starting.

521
00:54:14,621 --> 00:54:18,941
If I change anything inside my audio file, the final output also changes, right?

522
00:54:19,171 --> 00:54:22,900
If I can use a completely new dataset. So let's say I run the Artemis file.

523
00:54:22,901 --> 00:54:26,171
Right. Reds data from 1990 to 2000.

524
00:54:26,171 --> 00:54:29,221
Right. Your manager sends you the latest data.

525
00:54:29,501 --> 00:54:32,831
You to go back to Excel and sort of, you know, feed that Excel thing again.

526
00:54:33,131 --> 00:54:39,551
You just run the same file. You get the data into the script itself as it's already done right.

527
00:54:39,791 --> 00:54:44,011
And you get a newer set of results and there's nothing to be newly ordered again.

528
00:54:44,021 --> 00:54:48,551
So that's one advantage of that as well, right? There's no need to get back to making plots manually again.

529
00:54:48,791 --> 00:54:52,901
You essentially your code that is being rewritten. Right. Takes care of all of that.

530
00:54:53,751 --> 00:54:56,801
Well, yeah. Again there was also reproducible.

531
00:54:56,811 --> 00:55:00,591
So this is essentially all of the evangelizing about art.

532
00:55:00,801 --> 00:55:06,801
Why art is awesome. I'm going to sort of, you know, sort of press the brakes on the art of Benjamin Jordan to see if it's good about I mean,

533
00:55:06,801 --> 00:55:09,261
so my objective is to sort of make you use my algorithms.

534
00:55:09,501 --> 00:55:13,611
You can use them of algorithms that efficiently next to this might be a very helpful tool to that.

535
00:55:15,441 --> 00:55:19,461
So we absorb the bunch of resources. You already have this, right?

536
00:55:19,671 --> 00:55:23,211
So in the States you have you have that identified. So you can take a look at that.

537
00:55:23,511 --> 00:55:33,941
But what I want to do is go to your career console here, go to file and go to new file here.

538
00:55:33,951 --> 00:55:37,641
Okay. And the new file, I want you to open this.

539
00:55:37,901 --> 00:55:41,061
Our motto. A new automotive playbook.

540
00:55:46,471 --> 00:55:49,501
Yeah. So okay, that's a good question. So for that, you need something else.

541
00:55:54,031 --> 00:55:59,041
Did you get an error when you did that? Did you get a note as well? We had to install packages.

542
00:55:59,191 --> 00:56:05,881
Exactly. Yes. Yes. So what do you want to do as first?

543
00:56:07,491 --> 00:56:14,921
The first step then essentially becomes is I think I had that on canvas that I have to the third step and saw I don't know if I saw that or not.

544
00:56:15,251 --> 00:56:20,380
In software installation you have our our studio and our markdown package installation, but that's fine.

545
00:56:20,381 --> 00:56:23,471
You can just do it now if you want. Yeah. So R&D, right.

546
00:56:23,471 --> 00:56:31,411
I think that's the one. And yeah, this is the one.

547
00:56:31,411 --> 00:56:34,890
Right. So the fact is that you want to go to the way I went here, by the way, I'm going to do it again.

548
00:56:34,891 --> 00:56:38,311
Right. I want to tools. I want to install packages.

549
00:56:38,791 --> 00:56:44,821
And I essentially taught here Armageddon. Okay. And I just installed that along with dependencies.

550
00:56:45,801 --> 00:56:50,361
I was going to do a bunch of warning messages and stuff to get ignored that right. As long as you don't get an error message, you should be good.

551
00:56:53,421 --> 00:56:56,991
Okay. You're getting some error messages, but let's see if that's fine or not.

552
00:57:02,871 --> 00:57:15,520
Okay, so now what I'm gonna do is I'm going to do library. I think this has got to be an issue because it's a publicly it's not my personal system.

553
00:57:15,521 --> 00:57:28,421
Right. It's just going to be a problem when you try doing install packages are marked on do you get any errors?

554
00:57:28,661 --> 00:57:31,381
Because I think I'm going to get it easier because the publicly, you know,

555
00:57:31,871 --> 00:57:36,821
admin level set up and I'm not able to sort of override installation permissions here.

556
00:57:37,031 --> 00:57:43,301
But I think you should be getting it fine. Right. Okay. If anyone gets an error, I'm going to come and help you with that later.

557
00:57:44,341 --> 00:57:49,141
But I think I can do it, too, because it just it just achieves a thing and that might be a problem.

558
00:57:49,801 --> 00:57:54,631
Okay. So you've done the installation art student Armageddon and you're good with that, right?

559
00:57:54,871 --> 00:57:58,161
Okay. Okay.

560
00:57:59,001 --> 00:58:00,111
Again, how the Gospels work.

561
00:58:00,111 --> 00:58:06,141
I don't assume any programing language and I think we are by and large on the opposite of, you know, a newish thing, you know, which is great.

562
00:58:06,701 --> 00:58:11,240
I'm assuming that there are some stats knowledge which you all have done in your previous sessions.

563
00:58:11,241 --> 00:58:14,121
Write about hypothesis testing, what data store that should be.

564
00:58:14,121 --> 00:58:19,070
Okay, and you'll know what in regression as we did a quick sort of background about that.

565
00:58:19,071 --> 00:58:25,791
But that's important to sort of know what what that's actually doing is not quite textbook but generally for data science, right?

566
00:58:25,791 --> 00:58:30,761
This book by ah how do you become on a guy to draw him on is super, super useful.

567
00:58:30,771 --> 00:58:32,061
It's also open source and free.

568
00:58:32,391 --> 00:58:40,641
So in case the sorts of stuff it's making you get excited about are on data science would recommend sort of going down that path.

569
00:58:40,641 --> 00:58:47,871
Right? And remember, art is one way of doing it is one programing language a lot of data scientists use by time, which is very, very common.

570
00:58:47,871 --> 00:58:50,361
Right. I think one or two of you in a class on Python as well. Right.

571
00:58:50,691 --> 00:58:59,840
But there's this sort of you know, there's this one dichotomy or so, but a lot of statisticians use are primarily for everything.

572
00:58:59,841 --> 00:59:05,541
Right. And a lot of ML heavy people use Python specifically, but I think both of them are remarkably interchangeable.

573
00:59:05,541 --> 00:59:11,961
So I'm mainly on the start side of things. So I use R but does almost everything that machine learning needs to be done.

574
00:59:13,221 --> 00:59:17,481
Okay, so the goal of the classes to sort of, you know, teach you to perform statistical analysis,

575
00:59:17,481 --> 00:59:20,121
some statistical analysis, not getting too much into the details.

576
00:59:20,361 --> 00:59:26,241
Most important to understand what my stats stats models are throwing at me and to interpret them right

577
00:59:26,931 --> 00:59:32,541
execute of the show MLA functions which are going to be forests and trees and these other things.

578
00:59:32,541 --> 00:59:37,641
Right. So I wouldn't be expecting you to sort of, you know, as I mentioned, do the starting from scratch.

579
00:59:37,791 --> 00:59:44,000
I'm going to give you a lot of the score by myself. But what you have to change in that code, right, is what's the Y variable?

580
00:59:44,001 --> 00:59:49,401
What's the X variable, right? What are the other parameters to get the right level of accuracy that you want.

581
00:59:49,611 --> 00:59:51,681
And that's something that you'll be playing around with. Right?

582
00:59:51,981 --> 00:59:57,741
But it's not going to be learning a new language from scratch to produce some of these results.

583
00:59:57,741 --> 01:00:02,691
Reports using the R markdown is going to be helpful for your class project already done at the stuff that you're doing.

584
01:00:02,691 --> 01:00:08,211
Right. You might learn how to generate some graphical summaries on.

585
01:00:09,751 --> 01:00:15,480
It's a mite because there is a whole class for teaching you lots and visualizations and art.

586
01:00:15,481 --> 01:00:24,241
Right. And we don't have the time for that in this class. Having neat looking graphs is very helpful for any client project consulting project, right?

587
01:00:24,871 --> 01:00:28,021
Even for, let's say, a group analysis if you do any these analysis.

588
01:00:28,471 --> 01:00:34,771
But if it come to that and you we don't haven't covered that in class because it's a project we're going to work together.

589
01:00:34,771 --> 01:00:43,681
I'm happy to help you with that. When we when we work on a project together, we talked about this why art is awesome.

590
01:00:44,011 --> 01:00:48,511
So now let's come to the individual sort of, you know, aspects about art and play along with that for a bit.

591
01:00:49,381 --> 01:00:52,861
So I mentioned here this is the consort, right?

592
01:00:54,921 --> 01:00:59,031
So what am I going to do here? So this is something that I can interact with the system right away, right?

593
01:00:59,031 --> 01:01:06,891
So let's do something very simple, basic mathematical operations. So this sign here, this this arrow here, right, is where you enter commands, right?

594
01:01:07,071 --> 01:01:11,451
And you sort of interact with the computer. Let's say I want to say I want to figure out two plus five.

595
01:01:12,291 --> 01:01:15,840
And I get the result right away, which is essentially, as I mentioned.

596
01:01:15,841 --> 01:01:20,570
But it's instant. It's very interactive. That's how it works. I could do a bunch of other things, right?

597
01:01:20,571 --> 01:01:26,060
So I could sort of multiply. I could. Well, yeah, this is essentially basic math, right?

598
01:01:26,061 --> 01:01:30,681
I mean, I'm just doing that. But just these are super basic arithmetic operators.

599
01:01:31,011 --> 01:01:32,291
You can do all of that interaction.

600
01:01:32,311 --> 01:01:38,811
Can you see that or should I instead of, you know, increase the font a little bit for the people in the back row, especially a little bit different.

601
01:01:39,101 --> 01:01:48,691
Okay. Thank you. You. I just went now or something.

602
01:01:49,021 --> 01:01:53,671
Yeah, but. So when we put these guys a little bit together.

603
01:02:00,581 --> 01:02:05,511
Okay. So, you know, all of that stuff, you know, square roots, you can do a bunch of these arithmetic operators, right?

604
01:02:05,511 --> 01:02:11,451
So I will add cheat sheets to your module two for the week to right.

605
01:02:11,451 --> 01:02:16,701
Which will have things you can play around with. So in your free time, if you want to do that, you're welcome to do that.

606
01:02:16,731 --> 01:02:21,111
Okay. You're typing commands. That's how the console works, right?

607
01:02:21,111 --> 01:02:24,951
You type in command that gives you back the answers or the errors and so on.

608
01:02:24,951 --> 01:02:29,151
So let me give you an example of an error here. Right. If I do something like two.

609
01:02:32,141 --> 01:02:41,021
Yeah. Two plus. I'd say three times five.

610
01:02:41,031 --> 01:02:45,091
Okay. And let me do one thing. I'm going to add an extra parenthesis here.

611
01:02:45,551 --> 01:02:49,301
Read about it. This is not required. When I do that, I get an error from this one.

612
01:02:49,301 --> 01:02:52,721
Right. And this is a super basic example, right? You have way more complex errors in this.

613
01:02:52,991 --> 01:02:58,671
But just for you to get a flavor of what we're doing, you. Okay.

614
01:02:59,901 --> 01:03:03,560
Until now, we were doing, like, very basic things, right?

615
01:03:03,561 --> 01:03:09,081
So this is what I've talked about. So you okay? And if you also one more thing to note here, right?

616
01:03:09,081 --> 01:03:15,630
So let's say if I do something like two plus. I start writing here.

617
01:03:15,631 --> 01:03:19,581
Right square root of. Right.

618
01:03:19,971 --> 01:03:26,931
And I want to add something here. Let's say when I did five year write and I went out again, ten here, but and don't enter here,

619
01:03:27,531 --> 01:03:31,491
you had a plus sign there which essentially are telling you that, hey, you haven't finished your code.

620
01:03:31,821 --> 01:03:35,091
Finish this thing. You finished the bottom. This is only then will execute this.

621
01:03:35,451 --> 01:03:39,711
So I'll sell it in nine. You are still telling me, listen here that this is still open.

622
01:03:40,011 --> 01:03:45,261
The closed part of this is only then I'm going to execute that. When I do that, that's when the result comes in.

623
01:03:45,471 --> 01:03:49,851
Okay, just an example of how and when you do these are let's see if I was just giving an example.

624
01:03:49,851 --> 01:03:55,521
I'm going to jump like five steps ahead to make it a bit more or less said if, you know, high school or middle school stuff.

625
01:03:55,851 --> 01:04:01,491
But let's say if I was doing L.M. or linear, linear, moderate or something like.

626
01:04:03,111 --> 01:04:06,201
You know, let's stick with middle school because I don't want to confuse you.

627
01:04:06,201 --> 01:04:10,250
And in the first step, I mean, I'm going to say I don't want to jump run before we start walking.

628
01:04:10,251 --> 01:04:15,131
Okay. So it's okay. Let's be patient. Let's go with step by step. Okay. Okay.

629
01:04:15,251 --> 01:04:22,031
So here we have. So yeah this is what you get. Interact with the console using that right now or that's the console.

630
01:04:23,861 --> 01:04:28,281
Enzo. We talked about that already. I keep going back in this vernacular.

631
01:04:32,351 --> 01:04:37,001
As my file. I've been all over the place now. This is fantastic. Okay.

632
01:04:39,441 --> 01:04:43,960
Okay. This is fine. So this is something that you can do, essentially, right?

633
01:04:43,961 --> 01:04:50,081
So now if you want to open a new drama tone file. Right? Just just get to that.

634
01:04:50,711 --> 01:04:54,161
And I don't think I can edit that, but I'm going to open another paper, so.

635
01:04:55,181 --> 01:05:00,821
They want to open for me because I don't have here. So how about somebody do this for me again?

636
01:05:01,391 --> 01:05:05,721
Go to file your file. Open our mouth and get everybody opened up. Okay.

637
01:05:05,781 --> 01:05:07,551
Perfect. So then what you do is.

638
01:05:11,971 --> 01:05:17,081
Let me, Ashley and all I can find from here, from my computer here and to that to the tribes that that's going to be easy to show.

639
01:05:19,061 --> 01:05:25,391
I'm going to work with Adecco next time on, which is that if you just get are functioning properly there.

640
01:05:25,871 --> 01:05:30,311
So when you click on our my tone is going to open you will you know that that sort of pop up right

641
01:05:30,581 --> 01:05:37,121
with document presentation shiny from template does have document in the title just add hello world.

642
01:05:37,151 --> 01:05:42,071
Okay. And just click on Let the default outperform.

643
01:05:42,071 --> 01:05:45,791
I'd be at Steam. I just want an HDMI generation. Right. And press.

644
01:05:45,791 --> 01:05:50,561
Okay. What happens then is you get a title output date, right.

645
01:05:50,801 --> 01:05:55,361
And then you get something like three or. A great chunk.

646
01:05:55,481 --> 01:06:00,661
You guys all get that aggression, right? That chunk essentially is where your core resides, right?

647
01:06:00,711 --> 01:06:04,841
Stuff inside that is, is things that are sees and executes that.

648
01:06:05,411 --> 01:06:09,161
So let that thing be there. Keep going down.

649
01:06:09,491 --> 01:06:13,241
You have the hashtag hashtag Armageddon, right?

650
01:06:13,571 --> 01:06:18,191
That is what Armageddon sees as a head heading. It's like a heading when you generate that, you see later.

651
01:06:18,401 --> 01:06:25,511
Give me a quick second. So that's like all header for your page for what's being generated, the report that we generate, right?

652
01:06:26,591 --> 01:06:30,321
You have all the sort of text there that's not code that just basic text.

653
01:06:30,671 --> 01:06:36,281
The compiler, when you execute this, reads that as non executable code.

654
01:06:36,401 --> 01:06:40,671
Okay. Anything between that gray zone, it's called the code chunks.

655
01:06:40,701 --> 01:06:46,780
Okay. And the way you distinguish between that is through those are all but inverted commas.

656
01:06:46,781 --> 01:06:51,611
Right. And you start with that. Now, inside that, you have summary cars.

657
01:06:52,001 --> 01:06:55,611
So cars is a data set that is preloaded in OBJ.

658
01:06:55,901 --> 01:06:59,831
So I'm going to show this to you. So when you hit cars here, right, you get something.

659
01:06:59,861 --> 01:07:04,031
So if you go to the console in your heart and read the console, which is this guy here,

660
01:07:04,511 --> 01:07:09,970
if you hit cars, this type cars, all small letters and remember all risk sensitive.

661
01:07:09,971 --> 01:07:14,621
So it's not capital cars. You get an error in captaincy. So you get something like that, right?

662
01:07:15,311 --> 01:07:18,311
Or write something like this. View.

663
01:07:18,551 --> 01:07:21,731
View with a capital V. Open parentheses.

664
01:07:22,361 --> 01:07:28,341
Cars. When I do that, I get one more time that opens up, right?

665
01:07:28,731 --> 01:07:36,441
And I have speed, distance and a bunch of these things. Essentially, this is would you have a cars dataset in bold with an odd when you had that,

666
01:07:36,621 --> 01:07:42,411
you essentially get a dataset with around 50 entries, right, with the corresponding speed and distance values.

667
01:07:42,801 --> 01:07:47,561
And that's two squares. That's what it has. Okay. So now when?

668
01:07:48,401 --> 01:07:54,741
So you and you're doing a summary of cars. So let's just run that. The function summary is a function you view as a function.

669
01:07:54,911 --> 01:07:59,261
All of these things which are about part this is your right are functions and what else.

670
01:07:59,261 --> 01:08:02,261
Functions, functions taking any value you give to them.

671
01:08:02,261 --> 01:08:09,221
And the value could be a table, it could be a data set, it could be X's advise, write variables and gives you an output.

672
01:08:09,731 --> 01:08:14,531
So when I interview function cars, cars is the object going to the function?

673
01:08:14,831 --> 01:08:20,081
I get the view of the dealers of cars. Now let's type something called summary.

674
01:08:22,581 --> 01:08:26,181
Cause if you do that right summary function.

675
01:08:26,721 --> 01:08:33,021
That's how I distinguish you, cause you get this one. So what it tells you is that my college dataset has two variables.

676
01:08:33,261 --> 01:08:38,840
It's got speed, it's got distance. Right. And it summarizes each of those variables.

677
01:08:38,841 --> 01:08:45,381
Are the columns anyhow, up in the dataset frame of what is the first quarter or second quarter and so on?

678
01:08:45,681 --> 01:08:48,881
Yes. Where did the card veto come from?

679
01:08:48,891 --> 01:08:53,151
You have it in the. It's it's been always developed.

680
01:08:53,151 --> 01:08:57,221
Right. The biggest version of I that has these very basic datasets stored.

681
01:08:57,891 --> 01:09:03,021
So it's out already. So when you download and install it right it hasn't only saved its whole.

682
01:09:05,751 --> 01:09:12,191
And again, distance is the other column that you have. So now for a lot of things that we will be doing in this class, right?

683
01:09:12,201 --> 01:09:16,971
I mean, essentially for health care assets as well. They've been researchers who have created these packages.

684
01:09:17,271 --> 01:09:22,611
Let's see, Armageddon was one package that you don't need to do it right. I'm going to get you to put the health care package.

685
01:09:22,851 --> 01:09:30,691
They already have a health care asset stored in that package so that we have cars that's in the base version of which everybody gets for free.

686
01:09:30,711 --> 01:09:35,841
Everything is for free here. But I think everybody gets as you start are looking at other data sets based

687
01:09:35,841 --> 01:09:39,771
on the the package you install it to watch this some of you to keep in mind.

688
01:09:40,461 --> 01:09:49,581
Okay. So now what what I want to do is write if you go down further than that, in that ordinary file you have including plots, you see that.

689
01:09:50,271 --> 01:09:54,591
And then in that function you have, you can't S.T.A.R.T. because it's automatic isn't activated here,

690
01:09:55,011 --> 01:10:00,381
but then you have blood pressure or something like that in that. Right. So you have you can plot, you can do a bunch of summary.

691
01:10:00,651 --> 01:10:04,011
So do me a favor. Now go to this thing called net.

692
01:10:04,311 --> 01:10:08,571
You see this net here, right click on net and anywhere on your files.

693
01:10:09,831 --> 01:10:13,011
When you do that, what happens now? No one's getting it.

694
01:10:13,101 --> 01:10:15,861
You get something like say file, right? Because you haven't saved the file yet.

695
01:10:16,281 --> 01:10:21,291
The first one is telling me to download the string package with the string.

696
01:10:21,311 --> 01:10:25,101
Ah, there it's a string. I think I'm okay.

697
01:10:25,101 --> 01:10:30,651
Okay. And then when I do it, it's always giving me an error. Okay, so I want to come to that number two in there in the break.

698
01:10:31,311 --> 01:10:38,390
Sure. Is everybody adding is anybody at classroom? You end up an indicator if you'll find with more errors.

699
01:10:38,391 --> 01:10:40,881
Right. Okay. I'm going to come to you all in in the break. Okay.

700
01:10:42,411 --> 01:10:45,691
So what do you want to do is you save the file with whatever name you want to be a good name.

701
01:10:45,761 --> 01:10:49,130
So let's just call that as a helloworld or underscore.

702
01:10:49,131 --> 01:10:55,761
Ah, okay, save that. And now when you enter that, you get something that's popping out for you.

703
01:10:56,741 --> 01:11:01,181
You get a helloworld file, you get that. Does everybody get a generated HDMI file?

704
01:11:01,181 --> 01:11:07,961
Right. I mean, you go down, you'll see how it has embedded the plot in your file output file as well.

705
01:11:10,021 --> 01:11:14,071
You can also open the file in the browser if you want, if you see there's an open thing in the browser, right?

706
01:11:14,431 --> 01:11:17,760
So essentially it generates a report for you or slides for you.

707
01:11:17,761 --> 01:11:23,401
Right, based on whatever instructions you give out. Right. But this is an exact, very obvious example of what you can do with it.

708
01:11:24,271 --> 01:11:27,601
Is everybody with me on this? I mean, I know you are getting letters. I'm going to come to you in a bit.

709
01:11:27,901 --> 01:11:32,961
But everybody else, you guys, I got you good with it. Okay, perfect.

710
01:11:32,971 --> 01:11:36,051
So I think we have that right. And save your file as hello.

711
01:11:36,071 --> 01:11:41,671
What? Right. So what we'll be doing for a lot of your program, not a lot of people classes right.

712
01:11:41,671 --> 01:11:46,681
When I give you the are functions you'll be saving that in a lot of my files and giving that to give you

713
01:11:46,681 --> 01:11:50,911
a final output and you get all your results and step through it so that we can interpret that together.

714
01:11:51,451 --> 01:11:55,071
Okay. Okay.

715
01:11:55,921 --> 01:11:57,960
There are some. Then there's something called commence. Right.

716
01:11:57,961 --> 01:12:02,521
So the we are distinguishes between what's called versus not called wrestle and let's come here.

717
01:12:03,121 --> 01:12:06,151
So here this is the slides which are called an audit, right?

718
01:12:06,541 --> 01:12:10,321
So I'm going to come to the code and then talk about it a bit. Mm hmm.

719
01:12:10,351 --> 01:12:16,260
Okay. So this is as you saw, right? This is what was the chunk, which the code is so hard to distinguish.

720
01:12:16,261 --> 01:12:19,331
And I would agree what's like. Yeah, it's a minus.

721
01:12:19,371 --> 01:12:24,750
Okay. With that. So, yeah, this is great that I can see on my screen.

722
01:12:24,751 --> 01:12:27,811
You don't see gray on your screen, but this is great for sure, right?

723
01:12:27,841 --> 01:12:33,571
Anything that's within those or that that code chunk is gray. And what I write here is stuff that I was going to execute.

724
01:12:34,051 --> 01:12:38,161
So I'm going to say something like, this is a.

725
01:12:39,511 --> 01:12:44,580
Variable. Now whenever you have a hashtag inside the code chunk.

726
01:12:44,581 --> 01:12:48,990
Right. Ah. Reads that as a comment. It's for your understanding.

727
01:12:48,991 --> 01:12:51,811
It's not for the compiler to understand that.

728
01:12:52,081 --> 01:12:58,741
And I would recommend doing that because whenever you are running massive programs, right, it's easy to get confused about what steps you're doing.

729
01:12:59,161 --> 01:13:03,691
So essentially, what if I want to do something like this, right? I'm going to add.

730
01:13:05,201 --> 01:13:08,291
Three and four. And save.

731
01:13:09,671 --> 01:13:13,781
Three in variable data point one.

732
01:13:14,771 --> 01:13:19,931
So data point one is the new variable I'm creating. Okay. And let's call it assign the value three here.

733
01:13:20,231 --> 01:13:28,651
Okay. And. And the same song.

734
01:13:28,661 --> 01:13:35,981
You. Those that I will save for invariable.

735
01:13:37,561 --> 01:13:41,341
Data. Point to the data point to.

736
01:13:43,111 --> 01:13:48,061
Is it good for now to some is some of values.

737
01:13:48,601 --> 01:13:54,400
Is there that point one. Through some shortcut here.

738
01:13:54,401 --> 01:14:01,841
Right. So essentially added some values. Right. And an equal to and I wanted to add the point one ended up to, okay,

739
01:14:02,261 --> 01:14:11,920
so what I do is I start the day and I put tab and pick that up when you are being so you have a prompt now to go for any of these funds.

740
01:14:11,921 --> 01:14:15,101
So I'm going to use the down arrow. Can you see this or no?

741
01:14:16,141 --> 01:14:20,311
Chad. Is it okay? It's all right. You can see it.

742
01:14:20,311 --> 01:14:23,941
Okay. Weird because. Oh, yeah. Sorry about that.

743
01:14:23,941 --> 01:14:27,871
I mean, no reason. Sorry. Is it in the gray?

744
01:14:28,411 --> 01:14:32,041
It's not the gray. It's in the gray one. Oh, my God. It's in the gray. This is the gray.

745
01:14:32,881 --> 01:14:38,011
So let me just highlight this part of it. I should work on the should be in a V or something.

746
01:14:38,011 --> 01:14:43,640
AIDS in tools. The arts in contradiction to the contrast.

747
01:14:43,641 --> 01:14:47,601
Exactly the rules. And then there's the global options.

748
01:14:47,691 --> 01:14:54,561
Okay. That's very helpful. Thank you. So let me make it a little foreign to Ed that you have student loans.

749
01:14:54,861 --> 01:15:00,071
Oh, it's a good fine. Try try try this. Right. So I think it's an important one.

750
01:15:00,081 --> 01:15:03,271
One of the big two big window, those loans. Oh, gotcha.

751
01:15:03,771 --> 01:15:08,391
Oh, okay. Okay. So is this. Yeah, that's. I don't know if this is more visible or not.

752
01:15:08,431 --> 01:15:15,921
Let's. Let's try. That's true. I think the major concern with that is, you know, as it is this year, the chunks will be different colors than.

753
01:15:22,381 --> 01:15:28,111
Oh, my God. Should I do this? Let's start doing this again. Okay.

754
01:15:28,151 --> 01:15:32,310
Since this is going to be okay, so we can begin. We can play around with this.

755
01:15:32,311 --> 01:15:36,241
But I forgot. So let me. Let me talk. Let me go talk through it. Okay. That might be more helpful.

756
01:15:37,651 --> 01:15:42,541
This is going to be okay. Yeah. You know, I think let's just suck it up and go for it.

757
01:15:42,541 --> 01:15:48,510
I think I'm going to next legs next session, read a list, walk with them to make it a little bit better or something.

758
01:15:48,511 --> 01:15:57,711
But I think it's just a I don't know if it's chaos that's the right kind of.

759
01:15:59,701 --> 01:16:06,271
Yeah. I don't think this is going to be helpful. Honestly, I just threw a.

760
01:16:07,411 --> 01:16:11,371
Oh, yeah. No, this is worse.

761
01:16:11,941 --> 01:16:19,680
This is really bad. So I've never you never had the problem with that topic last night because it's so much bigger.

762
01:16:19,681 --> 01:16:27,851
So much bigger right here. Is this better compared to the previous one?

763
01:16:27,861 --> 01:16:31,451
At least you can see the difference. I can see from here. Right. This is much darker.

764
01:16:31,481 --> 01:16:36,491
This is a bit lighter. Right. So at least let's you know, let's let's work with let's make lemonade out of lemons.

765
01:16:36,491 --> 01:16:40,391
I'm sorry for that. But, you know, this is what we have. So essentially this.

766
01:16:40,681 --> 01:16:47,261
So when you started this guy here like this indicates the start of the cold channel and this is the end of the cold channel.

767
01:16:47,501 --> 01:16:50,791
So whenever you have something like that that applies, this is going to be executed.

768
01:16:52,301 --> 01:16:57,731
So what I'm doing here, right, I've made variables X and Y, I've assign them values three and two.

769
01:16:58,421 --> 01:17:01,960
And [INAUDIBLE] what I'm doing is I want to add on a similarly have made at a point

770
01:17:01,961 --> 01:17:05,501
one data point two these are two variables I've given them values three and four,

771
01:17:05,771 --> 01:17:09,281
and now I want to add them and make a new variable called sum values.

772
01:17:09,371 --> 01:17:16,421
Okay. What I want to show you is a shortcut. Essentially, when it was something like somebody uses a call to let's say when I data point one, right.

773
01:17:16,751 --> 01:17:22,451
I start typing d d okay. And it gives you that's an option, right?

774
01:17:22,451 --> 01:17:31,360
So I just go, what am I do I get this one right and hit enter now plus data again and it gives you I could

775
01:17:31,361 --> 01:17:36,220
either press tab or it just pops on its own and depends on how responsive a system sometimes is.

776
01:17:36,221 --> 01:17:39,491
Right. So again, this. This is what I can use.

777
01:17:39,491 --> 01:17:47,701
Right? And now I want to let it print. Some values print as a function again so an agent doesn't know something like, you know,

778
01:17:47,701 --> 01:17:52,261
a function with open part of this closed parenthesis that implies the function which takes values.

779
01:17:52,891 --> 01:17:56,341
So here we have added this is the first function you saw, right?

780
01:17:56,521 --> 01:18:01,141
The friend is a function. Your saw you earlier, you saw somebody earlier, but this is what this does.

781
01:18:01,621 --> 01:18:08,791
Now let's execute that on the console. So this is the minimized console, which I'm going to put that up again here.

782
01:18:08,791 --> 01:18:12,731
Right. So this is the console. This is the source file.

783
01:18:13,511 --> 01:18:18,070
And the way you execute your source spinal cord into the console.

784
01:18:18,071 --> 01:18:21,671
Right. Interacting with all is this. So one way you could do is.

785
01:18:23,731 --> 01:18:27,571
And remember, you have to always start to assign the value. You have entered the code here.

786
01:18:27,871 --> 01:18:31,471
But that hasn't been executed. Nothing has come to the environment yet.

787
01:18:31,741 --> 01:18:35,791
Right. So our doesn't know what you've done. You just see if that in your text file.

788
01:18:36,211 --> 01:18:41,801
So you have to execute that for our to save it. We take a break in 2 minutes, like after this example is time.

789
01:18:43,181 --> 01:18:49,001
So I'm going to and there are multiple ways of doing that. One way is go to the line that you want to execute.

790
01:18:49,541 --> 01:18:58,141
Press control. Enter. When Enter Control to control enter, it goes to the next line and that line is executed.

791
01:18:58,171 --> 01:19:02,671
So now what's happened is we see this when I did control and though it came here,

792
01:19:03,481 --> 01:19:07,891
it came to the console, it was executed and it also came in the environment.

793
01:19:08,161 --> 01:19:12,990
So now odyssey of the value they don't want one is three out of the same thing to come

794
01:19:12,991 --> 01:19:17,841
down here to control enter and now the same thing is happen is going to execute it.

795
01:19:18,181 --> 01:19:23,201
The console has that and the value has been saved. I come down here for control?

796
01:19:23,201 --> 01:19:26,361
Enter. I have a new values. Some values?

797
01:19:26,381 --> 01:19:29,381
Three plus four. Based on that one control.

798
01:19:29,381 --> 01:19:33,461
Enter. I get the output. You print some values.

799
01:19:34,451 --> 01:19:38,141
Some of you might be getting your output in your in your source file.

800
01:19:39,061 --> 01:19:43,631
Are you getting that? Are you getting the value here? I haven't here yet.

801
01:19:43,691 --> 01:19:46,691
Okay. Let me come to you in a bit. Oh, yes. You have a question.

802
01:19:48,311 --> 01:19:54,671
I don't I'm not getting the like I like the hashtag and I'll say, for that matter, the concept.

803
01:19:54,761 --> 01:19:58,991
So, yeah, the hashtag is when I run that, right.

804
01:19:59,861 --> 01:20:05,591
Yeah. That will never if you come on the console. But it's a, it's a, it's a it's just off comment.

805
01:20:05,681 --> 01:20:08,531
It's not executed. Right. So it doesn't really matter.

806
01:20:08,951 --> 01:20:14,590
What have you have in the hashtag is only for you or let's say a meme, an Islamic army file for evaluation.

807
01:20:14,591 --> 01:20:18,361
Right, to understand what exactly is central. Exactly. To make sure it wasn't.

808
01:20:18,471 --> 01:20:25,841
Yeah. And so when I do this right and I print this, I get print of the some values and the values upended here.

809
01:20:26,111 --> 01:20:29,111
And that's going to be good at that. Right? I'm going to just come to do it.

810
01:20:29,591 --> 01:20:35,441
You got that. Okay. So at 654 now let's take a ten minute break.

811
01:20:35,441 --> 01:20:39,880
Right, and let's come back and then we start to see how much we can do or not.

812
01:20:39,881 --> 01:20:43,181
Today is going to be, you know, a bit of a slog because it's a new thing for you.

813
01:20:43,181 --> 01:20:46,241
All right. So after class today, I'll send you some videos.

814
01:20:46,931 --> 01:20:53,681
Watch them is going to hopefully get you better with that and we'll see how much we can accomplish today until the end of class and next.

815
01:20:53,681 --> 01:20:57,371
Last weekend looks more like I'll be around I'm going to work with you on the item

816
01:20:57,371 --> 01:21:26,221
defines through bucket seven will fight to the end of the year and have them do that.

817
01:21:27,761 --> 01:21:31,841
There is no way to do this.

818
01:21:33,341 --> 01:21:37,151
It's the wrong actions and of course modified.

819
01:21:37,601 --> 01:22:02,351
Yeah, I'm using yeah. At the end of the year that they're not in Monday's earlier I spoke with them

820
01:22:02,351 --> 01:22:16,071
every single day here and there and they found something very important to them.

821
01:22:16,121 --> 01:22:23,981
As far as I know, it was two years old, envy and also the value.

822
01:22:24,301 --> 01:22:28,121
You know I think that you know,

823
01:22:29,981 --> 01:22:46,081
usually titles under the title I didn't deliver because they are not even at the time because I will remember when I started to summarize the times,

824
01:22:46,481 --> 01:22:52,641
I was like, I am the area and I have never heard of that.

825
01:22:52,781 --> 01:23:00,311
So whatever that we're going to do, this is the one.

826
01:23:01,121 --> 01:23:16,931
I think what's interesting is that so many of them are we'll be running harder than ever before,

827
01:23:19,901 --> 01:23:27,261
and especially if I grew up in a couple of years working at the time.

828
01:23:27,261 --> 01:23:37,171
And we will work out your brand different positions now for you gentlemen.

829
01:23:37,681 --> 01:24:05,841
Since they come, I, I, they were kind of get free time, so I don't even know how much they are in terms of the 11000 values on their behalf.

830
01:24:09,191 --> 01:24:41,201
So I'm going to get a decent because why do you want to identify there are you know that I can tell you that I don't.

831
01:24:42,141 --> 01:24:47,481
You're going to have to look. I know they'll have another some questions.

832
01:24:49,551 --> 01:24:57,591
Oh, I guess it doesn't matter. You're going to do things are going to be said about her.

833
01:24:59,081 --> 01:25:08,811
And it didn't seem like last night.

834
01:25:10,131 --> 01:25:29,621
In fact, I don't have any reason to think that they were going to be having their.

835
01:25:31,961 --> 01:25:40,611
I did. It's just that I didn't know how much people you know,

836
01:25:42,821 --> 01:26:04,951
I really appreciate that nobody increase in the U.S. or I don't know know been under pressure and I.

837
01:26:05,321 --> 01:26:24,741
I really don't feel like I'm worried that it is actually going to become an easy one.

838
01:26:25,071 --> 01:26:32,091
I think you've got the kind of as your governor down the line of work and unemployed.

839
01:26:37,831 --> 01:26:45,691
In other words, it takes Hill too early to apply for something.

840
01:26:46,081 --> 01:26:55,531
You know, I don't think they want you to start complaining because I haven't ever been trying to get rid of it at this point.

841
01:26:55,801 --> 01:27:01,041
I mean, there's not a big well for my application. I mean, I.

842
01:27:01,571 --> 01:27:09,541
I know there's events that are maybe yes, she was wrong, but fortunately, I like them and good.

843
01:27:10,581 --> 01:27:14,160
I think they should do what happens with her. Why she didn't.

844
01:27:14,161 --> 01:27:27,961
And we keep talking about happened and instead I would be I don't know about that.

845
01:27:28,401 --> 01:27:37,591
Yeah I would say that's good news for now. But I mean, I'd also argue that we lost the percent of our opinions and you know how to read.

846
01:27:37,921 --> 01:27:55,381
You know what I mean? I think that's one of the things I want to talk about.

847
01:27:56,291 --> 01:28:07,421
So there are there is like when you think that military is like wars and it's just a little bit and I think that,

848
01:28:07,681 --> 01:28:18,231
you know, that the quality of life around here, I think there are more of them and more.

849
01:28:21,121 --> 01:28:25,471
All the time for like a year that you can wait, right?

850
01:28:27,121 --> 01:28:36,871
Oh, but I mean, you know, there's something else that is going on that whenever they hire ten.

851
01:28:37,441 --> 01:28:56,131
Yeah, I think there's something called the crystal ball or the entities like somebody's prediction where you go, right?

852
01:28:56,771 --> 01:29:03,501
Yeah. Yeah. I mean, it doesn't matter.

853
01:29:04,491 --> 01:29:24,981
You know, you have this thing here is this is happening to us, but nothing like that, you know, because you're like one person here, whatever.

854
01:29:26,601 --> 01:29:32,661
Like I said, we were all you. I just didn't like it.

855
01:29:32,731 --> 01:29:37,291
I just. I just feel like this.

856
01:29:37,461 --> 01:29:51,171
And with all this and I think was a human being, I'm like, homeland is not as long as, you know.

857
01:29:51,171 --> 01:29:59,661
I mean, I think just. Because I don't want to get out of my head.

858
01:30:00,201 --> 01:30:03,531
I try to understand. I don't know.

859
01:30:07,201 --> 01:30:19,911
Know. I remember there was just a theory that I thought it was in the final editing built for photography.

860
01:30:20,751 --> 01:30:26,841
By the way, you think you want to do this?

861
01:30:27,111 --> 01:30:41,301
Is anyone anywhere? I want to make was great, but she did that in the summer and I was like, you know how?

862
01:30:44,941 --> 01:30:49,931
Mom. No reason.

863
01:30:52,731 --> 01:30:55,931
Right after. Right?

864
01:30:56,931 --> 01:31:00,771
Yeah, right in the middle. Yeah.

865
01:31:01,191 --> 01:31:14,381
Oh, no, no. Oh, I don't know. I think we go back to where you let your guard down like that, and I do whatever I want to do.

866
01:31:15,251 --> 01:31:21,051
Yeah, I guess so. Yeah. Yeah.

867
01:31:21,641 --> 01:31:25,851
I'm always drawn to the things that I did not.

868
01:31:26,871 --> 01:31:37,821
Yeah, I can do it. I, I don't know. It's just that just like you don't really understand your heart.

869
01:31:38,171 --> 01:31:57,711
Yeah. Yeah, exactly. You know, I don't think I'm going to be like, you know, like, that's not a show.

870
01:31:58,371 --> 01:32:04,341
It's not like. Okay, so we invite.

871
01:32:05,631 --> 01:32:10,641
Hello, everyone. Come on, come on, come on. Because we're good. Okay, awesome.

872
01:32:10,641 --> 01:32:17,091
So we're back to our. Some of you might we're having issues with our still was because of compatibility issues.

873
01:32:17,091 --> 01:32:21,470
Right. I mean you you might have an older version of of a new version of our studio.

874
01:32:21,471 --> 01:32:25,460
So oftentimes when you get those errors. Remove our our studio.

875
01:32:25,461 --> 01:32:32,181
Reinstall the one that's appropriate for your system, you know, because you have marcoses of various capacities and types, right?

876
01:32:32,481 --> 01:32:37,011
So if you have any questions about that, I can work with you after class. Okay. I think one of you had that problem.

877
01:32:37,551 --> 01:32:40,971
I mean, also remember, as I mentioned, your functions are very case dependent.

878
01:32:41,331 --> 01:32:44,751
So small view will give you an adverse capital. Somebody is going to give you an error.

879
01:32:44,751 --> 01:32:50,061
So be careful about all those things. One thing you could do is whenever you have an error like that, right?

880
01:32:50,511 --> 01:32:53,990
I could do a question mark in the console. So a question mark is help.

881
01:32:53,991 --> 01:32:57,111
So let's say if I did question mark view. Okay.

882
01:32:58,081 --> 01:33:03,871
Here that opens up and which is the helpful help details for that particular function.

883
01:33:04,171 --> 01:33:09,861
And then I can essentially see what that function is doing. So what I see here is right view is the function.

884
01:33:10,231 --> 01:33:15,541
It takes arguments which I mentioned as the objects, right? X is the object it takes for.

885
01:33:15,541 --> 01:33:21,390
Let's see, the data here is view of view opioid need our view card zero.

886
01:33:21,391 --> 01:33:25,201
Right. And then it can sort of value what it eventually does.

887
01:33:25,741 --> 01:33:31,621
So this is going to be very helpful when you come to more advanced functions like linear models or random forests.

888
01:33:32,401 --> 01:33:35,941
If you have a job like this, do a question mark. By starting your right.

889
01:33:35,941 --> 01:33:39,300
You can also go to help directly and into the functions.

890
01:33:39,301 --> 01:33:43,411
And it's if I wanted to ask about random forest, right? So that is a function go round.

891
01:33:43,421 --> 01:33:48,401
You can sort of figure out what that is or let's see if I think this is the administrative.

892
01:33:48,661 --> 01:33:52,621
So a lot of packages are not downloaded. Right. But let's see if I want to see what range function is.

893
01:33:52,951 --> 01:33:56,791
It gives you what the function does. So remember, this is something that you can utilize, okay?

894
01:33:57,691 --> 01:34:00,331
Most more often than not, any problem that you have,

895
01:34:00,511 --> 01:34:06,300
you could just copy paste that error that you're getting to Google and you'll get the stock community.

896
01:34:06,301 --> 01:34:08,971
That's therefore odd, right? Super helpful.

897
01:34:09,301 --> 01:34:16,710
And I think anyone would be lying to you, be that your professor, be the rockstar researchers if they haven't used these stock overflows.

898
01:34:16,711 --> 01:34:23,401
Right. Or stock exchanges because they're a community of crowdsourced solutions and recommend that do to do it.

899
01:34:23,611 --> 01:34:28,170
And if you think that you can use that once, asking more questions would be therefore a rude shock.

900
01:34:28,171 --> 01:34:33,361
Because when people have done that before, right, the community gets back and be like, okay, don't post you have more questions here.

901
01:34:33,541 --> 01:34:37,800
You want to answer that feel so that that's that's a very interesting dynamic that plays out on here.

902
01:34:37,801 --> 01:34:42,091
So and more often than not you never get your homework solution that this is sort of you know,

903
01:34:42,091 --> 01:34:45,271
I'm sure you want to do that but I just throwing it out this.

904
01:34:48,741 --> 01:34:51,800
And one more thing. I don't know if you all have. I know somebody mentioned this.

905
01:34:51,801 --> 01:34:56,121
I think Spencer mentioned that last guys, right, Chad? Djibouti. Has anybody played with Djibouti?

906
01:34:56,931 --> 01:35:01,771
Yeah. So, in fact, Chad's you he could actually help you solve most of the problems you find in this class as well.

907
01:35:01,791 --> 01:35:07,191
Right. I mean, you can essentially say that, hey, can you give me a function for doing ABCDE things right?

908
01:35:07,551 --> 01:35:13,101
So that's why I don't think I want to test you on. Okay. Generating code for me, but hey, I want to see how good your coding skills are.

909
01:35:13,131 --> 01:35:17,001
That's what the objective of this class. But can charge CBT help you interpret.

910
01:35:17,001 --> 01:35:22,341
You know what those estimates are? Maybe. And if it does, good for you and good for me that you guys thought about this.

911
01:35:22,341 --> 01:35:26,761
Right? But again, I think the life of an educator has become infinitely harder.

912
01:35:26,781 --> 01:35:29,271
Right. But these tools. But they're also very useful.

913
01:35:29,481 --> 01:35:36,411
And as so many of people, so many of software engineers right now, just copy paste the code in which are good and I like and start working.

914
01:35:37,041 --> 01:35:41,221
And it's more often than not it gives you, okay, this is the issue with your code and stuff as well.

915
01:35:41,241 --> 01:35:47,031
Right. It's again, flawed, but it's it's super awesome and how it's been, it's and again, that's again the animal.

916
01:35:47,481 --> 01:35:54,711
So small digression from what we were doing something very we are working we don't want to run yet but again something that you would be cognizant of.

917
01:35:54,921 --> 01:35:58,701
You should be cognizant of. Okay, so let's get back to this.

918
01:35:59,241 --> 01:36:04,371
So we have talked about comments. We have talked about basic console operations, not about basic mathematical operators.

919
01:36:04,371 --> 01:36:11,240
Right. We've talked about variables. One thing that you want to note about variables or data elements in general.

920
01:36:11,241 --> 01:36:14,351
Right. They are not linked to changing.

921
01:36:14,361 --> 01:36:18,261
Let's say if you had something like here.

922
01:36:18,271 --> 01:36:23,781
Right. So a data point, one data point tool and I mentioned some values was data point one plus get up on two.

923
01:36:23,781 --> 01:36:29,000
Right. So here we have data. Point one is three, two was four, some is seven.

924
01:36:29,001 --> 01:36:37,521
Right. If I change, let's see data point 1 to 10, I get data point one is ten.

925
01:36:38,091 --> 01:36:41,630
But the same values doesn't change to seven because it's not linked.

926
01:36:41,631 --> 01:36:47,181
It's not this is not the way Ottawa central graph some functions actually I think MATLAB looks like that where you know

927
01:36:47,391 --> 01:36:53,541
there is an update of the way the value is stored in the variable are doesn't work like that to update the value,

928
01:36:53,541 --> 01:36:56,991
I have to again go back to my code here, which is some values, right?

929
01:36:58,271 --> 01:37:02,260
Run that control center and that's when it gets sort of re updated to make

930
01:37:02,261 --> 01:37:05,890
it 14 because this is something that I don't know if you will have an issue,

931
01:37:05,891 --> 01:37:09,101
but you might have an issue when you're somebody in your thing.

932
01:37:09,101 --> 01:37:17,291
You said, hey, because remember, this follows the chronological order things up here get executed first down here, get executed after that.

933
01:37:17,771 --> 01:37:24,970
So if you are running your code, you have entered data here and there, you will not get the result until you follow that sort of sequence and order.

934
01:37:24,971 --> 01:37:29,831
And that that's a mistake that I see happen more often than not in my previous experience, just for you to be aware of.

935
01:37:30,491 --> 01:37:35,711
Okay. And especially when you're working on programing, right? You're changing so many things, you you're editing it, you debugging it.

936
01:37:36,161 --> 01:37:41,081
It's good to be aware of what the flow of your code is so you don't make those errors very little.

937
01:37:41,801 --> 01:37:46,001
Okay. We talked about that. It doesn't get automatically updated.

938
01:37:46,001 --> 01:37:49,391
We have to re compute the somewhat somebody used to get the new value of x.

939
01:37:49,811 --> 01:37:53,861
Okay. We just talked about our numerical values.

940
01:37:54,911 --> 01:38:00,730
Variables can store nonmedical values as well. Right. So we had a data point, one data point to here.

941
01:38:00,731 --> 01:38:09,231
Right. I could also have a variable called a name student trait and that can essentially just be a serial.

942
01:38:09,231 --> 01:38:13,331
Okay. So we could have a name student that also.

943
01:38:17,571 --> 01:38:21,961
Control can always do a controlled effort to find. Where?

944
01:38:22,371 --> 01:38:27,021
Yeah. Okay. Yes. So and I've been I execute this.

945
01:38:27,261 --> 01:38:34,701
I see that this one gets stored here in the in the in the this is, again, the, the variable here and the value here.

946
01:38:34,971 --> 01:38:38,711
This is the text. Well, the earlier we had the we had the numbers there.

947
01:38:38,721 --> 01:38:45,111
Okay. Um, you can also have something which is more like, you know, address school.

948
01:38:46,431 --> 01:38:51,021
And you could have. Washington.

949
01:38:54,591 --> 01:39:03,171
And again, this is all to store it as a text for you. One way to know what what type dinner type your variable has.

950
01:39:03,621 --> 01:39:07,341
You could do something like SDI, which is essentially a short for structure.

951
01:39:09,811 --> 01:39:17,561
STR name student. And again tab it tells you see a chart which is a character for you look.

952
01:39:18,101 --> 01:39:24,461
And that means it's stored as a character. If I do SDR, it is a data point one.

953
01:39:26,411 --> 01:39:35,401
I get it as a numerical value as ten again things to sort of you know note on this is the basic are you think of.

954
01:39:35,651 --> 01:39:41,591
Okay so we can take text values it can take numeric values it can also take Boolean values, true or false.

955
01:39:42,551 --> 01:39:48,341
And the way this one works is let's say if I said student auditing.

956
01:39:51,681 --> 01:39:59,671
And I said, Well, no editing has true. So you can also have true false value, which is sort of one zero values, right?

957
01:39:59,971 --> 01:40:03,781
So I can truly enter into this. So student auditing is true.

958
01:40:04,021 --> 01:40:07,031
And by the way, 20 are indistinguishable.

959
01:40:07,051 --> 01:40:10,981
So when this auditing is true, it also reads internally as to what auditing is.

960
01:40:11,221 --> 01:40:14,761
So I can perceive it as this.

961
01:40:15,451 --> 01:40:20,471
Or I can save it as. Control we.

962
01:40:21,721 --> 01:40:28,231
Oh. Controlled seizures, controlled and administered.

963
01:40:28,941 --> 01:40:35,361
These two things are essentially the same thing. I see that, Steve, but it's totally untrue.

964
01:40:35,781 --> 01:40:42,531
Just something for you to know. [INAUDIBLE] use all of them in upsetting the offerings and stuff like that as we go for that in this setup.

965
01:40:44,091 --> 01:40:48,831
Okay. So we have that Boolean values, as I mentioned, would be useful for filtering your data.

966
01:40:48,981 --> 01:40:53,451
So let's see if I want to filter out all the values from our dataset of student records, right?

967
01:40:53,781 --> 01:40:56,931
All the values where students are not adding the class.

968
01:40:57,171 --> 01:41:03,711
So essentially where this particular value student auditing variable is true, I want only those entries from my dataset.

969
01:41:04,011 --> 01:41:11,271
That's where boolean values are going to be useful. Okay. From the example in that quick bit, you can ignore this one.

970
01:41:11,271 --> 01:41:16,311
I mean, typically what people usually. So the way you have equal to sign here, right?

971
01:41:17,661 --> 01:41:21,771
This is called the assignment operator. You can also write the same thing.

972
01:41:25,441 --> 01:41:32,071
As this slightly complex thingy which is less than signed with a dash.

973
01:41:32,941 --> 01:41:35,820
I think whenever you see folks who are more professional, right,

974
01:41:35,821 --> 01:41:42,571
there are code that you'll always find assignment operator as opposed to equal to, but not something for you to sort of, you know, bother about.

975
01:41:42,571 --> 01:41:46,321
But this so and this and this is the same thing is what you would want to know about.

976
01:41:59,951 --> 01:42:07,321
And this is a comment anywhere. Okay.

977
01:42:09,331 --> 01:42:15,031
We talked about very basic things. Now we're getting into more of a data view, which brings us to the hopefully the data set today.

978
01:42:15,031 --> 01:42:22,171
Right. Is moving beyond individual elements like, let's see, name one name to redefine one data, point to do a vector.

979
01:42:22,721 --> 01:42:28,021
Vector is a collection of values. So I'm interested in the names of all the students in the class.

980
01:42:28,021 --> 01:42:34,171
Right? So as opposed to having each name separately, each score separately, I want to save them as a list of vector.

981
01:42:34,471 --> 01:42:38,111
So essentially what I'm going to do is. Come here.

982
01:42:38,211 --> 01:42:46,051
Right. So this is essentially here. So this function again to remember the open parenthesis below our close by.

983
01:42:46,051 --> 01:42:51,781
This was a function. So this function called C essentially turns out to make a list of the elements inside.

984
01:42:52,261 --> 01:42:56,101
So what this is doing is right when I create remember this is a variable students.

985
01:42:56,461 --> 01:43:03,211
I create a new variable students assign it this value I've used for this particular assignment operator you can use equal to as well.

986
01:43:03,841 --> 01:43:11,731
And what it does is it assigns to the students a variable or the object, a list of values which are these ones.

987
01:43:11,971 --> 01:43:15,571
And all is separated by commas. And these are essentially names. So.

988
01:43:15,571 --> 01:43:26,641
So when I run this thing, you. And all right that essentially saves these six names in my students think.

989
01:43:27,031 --> 01:43:32,281
And if you look at look here in your environment right you see students now is saved as something

990
01:43:32,281 --> 01:43:39,301
else is saved as a character data type with six entries in it and all the names are saved in that.

991
01:43:39,781 --> 01:43:46,021
So I could also do something like SDR students and you have a captive type feel at 65 to use.

992
01:43:46,261 --> 01:43:51,631
One thing to remember is in a vector, all the elements in the vector have to be the same data type.

993
01:43:52,031 --> 01:43:55,561
You can have a mix of numbers and text in a vector.

994
01:43:56,561 --> 01:43:59,921
If you do that. Try. What? What happens when you do that?

995
01:44:01,861 --> 01:44:05,730
So right now I have students of midterm project program grading.

996
01:44:05,731 --> 01:44:10,171
Right. So let's make a new thing. Okay. Oh, excuse me.

997
01:44:10,951 --> 01:44:14,640
Testing mix. This is called a that. Let's use an equal design.

998
01:44:14,641 --> 01:44:21,121
Doesn't really matter. They're interchangeable. Right. Let's open this list up and let's add Spencer.

999
01:44:22,231 --> 01:44:29,341
Let's add a mirror and let's add one and two before I run this.

1000
01:44:29,461 --> 01:44:32,701
Do you think I get an arrow? Yeah. Look at that. Okay.

1001
01:44:33,091 --> 01:44:42,241
We think we'll get an editor who thinks I'll get an error. I won't get an edge because, well, numbers are only why you want to get married.

1002
01:44:42,251 --> 01:44:44,261
So that wasn't that wasn't a gotcha question,

1003
01:44:44,261 --> 01:44:53,470
you know but I mean sort of a middle are next for you got your fiance right one and two are numerically close but nothing stops one

1004
01:44:53,471 --> 01:45:00,130
and two from being considered as a mixed feelings about right one and two mean something if it's a numeric one one has a value,

1005
01:45:00,131 --> 01:45:06,881
two has a value that additive. But when they see it in something like this thing mix, then one and two don't have any value by themselves.

1006
01:45:06,881 --> 01:45:11,321
Numeric value. They just see if there's one two. Let me tell you what I mean by that.

1007
01:45:11,801 --> 01:45:16,921
So let's run this. Okay? This thing makes. Here you're seeing it still characterizes four values.

1008
01:45:17,671 --> 01:45:26,371
And when I run this, by the way, one thing that one more shortcut that you might want to remember is either control and or to execute the whole line.

1009
01:45:26,431 --> 01:45:31,381
Right. If I just want to see only see one particular variable and not the whole line,

1010
01:45:31,951 --> 01:45:35,850
I'm just going to highlight that one by doing control shift right at all.

1011
01:45:35,851 --> 01:45:44,090
Right. Control shipped right out. And then I do control and I only get that specific high level version of my code.

1012
01:45:44,091 --> 01:45:49,160
Right. So now testing mix has four values, if you can see that here it has Spencer.

1013
01:45:49,161 --> 01:45:55,461
And as a mirror it has one and two. But one and two are essentially fixed field fixed vertex values here.

1014
01:45:55,851 --> 01:46:00,051
They don't really mean one and two anymore. Okay. Makes sense.

1015
01:46:00,771 --> 01:46:05,480
So the idea being that it will always be one data type, it cannot be a mixed iterable vector,

1016
01:46:05,481 --> 01:46:16,011
the collection of values of the same data type and that you can do by the next step essentially is what if I want to index in students, right?

1017
01:46:16,221 --> 01:46:23,791
I want to get the fourth student from this list. The student is a victim of actor can comprise ten, 20, 100 elements.

1018
01:46:23,791 --> 01:46:33,810
Right. If I wanted the 100th element out of that the re I pull that out is I have my students of vector that I have there.

1019
01:46:33,811 --> 01:46:42,421
Right. I have a open and close bracket here and in the bracket I can index what value I want to get.

1020
01:46:42,841 --> 01:46:46,531
So let's say I want to get the colored student friend's name out of this one.

1021
01:46:46,531 --> 01:46:52,361
Okay. I put student three Byton has 012 and has one, two, three.

1022
01:46:52,651 --> 01:46:56,191
So this is one, two, three, four, five, six.

1023
01:46:56,551 --> 01:47:01,171
So when I hit students three, I get Frank, which comes on.

1024
01:47:02,281 --> 01:47:08,491
Okay. Again. So you can essentially index whatever value you want to extract from your vector.

1025
01:47:08,791 --> 01:47:12,241
These things are going to become very important when you think about the dataset itself.

1026
01:47:12,661 --> 01:47:16,711
If I want to get opioids, there are only those entries from 2010 onwards, right?

1027
01:47:16,981 --> 01:47:20,221
I can subset from that data and I'm showing you I'm essentially building up.

1028
01:47:20,731 --> 01:47:23,761
These are the building blocks to coming to that in a bit. Okay.

1029
01:47:24,901 --> 01:47:27,961
Similarly, let's do something now from testing mix.

1030
01:47:28,141 --> 01:47:31,561
I want to get the third element.

1031
01:47:33,591 --> 01:47:37,681
So let's call it three. Okay. And I get one here.

1032
01:47:38,711 --> 01:47:42,871
Okay. Do you see this? Now I want to get the fourth element.

1033
01:47:45,921 --> 01:47:49,091
Control we. And I had to look.

1034
01:47:50,151 --> 01:47:53,661
Nova. Add the third and the fourth element. What should they get?

1035
01:47:55,491 --> 01:48:01,311
Hmm. Yes, you're right. I'm going to add an error, because what I'm doing now are saved as text fields.

1036
01:48:01,611 --> 01:48:05,541
They're no longer numeric fields. So I wanted to show this for that exact reason.

1037
01:48:05,541 --> 01:48:06,891
So let's see if I want to create.

1038
01:48:07,731 --> 01:48:14,661
So remember, testing mix has the value testing makes three has the third value stored in it follows the fourth values so stored in it.

1039
01:48:14,991 --> 01:48:24,550
Now I want to let's see, create some value. Test and always try to give you all variable names or data table names.

1040
01:48:24,551 --> 01:48:31,281
Write meaningful names. Don't make them all. These are literally nothing uniform, you know what I mean?

1041
01:48:31,311 --> 01:48:37,881
To be a bit thoughtful about how you write your code because it's easy for you to understand when you get back to it a month later, right?

1042
01:48:38,151 --> 01:48:42,411
And for sure, for me to understand when I'm reading it, it's also a good data practice to do that.

1043
01:48:42,491 --> 01:48:45,661
Okay. So let's say we do controlled seizure.

1044
01:48:54,331 --> 01:48:58,411
And I'll just add this one. Read this. Okay, let's try to win this now.

1045
01:48:58,441 --> 01:49:02,281
I'm going to do that. What do I get? I get an error there, if I can see that one there.

1046
01:49:02,281 --> 01:49:07,951
There's an error in texting thing makes three processing makes for non numeric argument to binary operator.

1047
01:49:08,251 --> 01:49:12,151
So it's so it's one and two are no longer numeric here because they see it as a text for you.

1048
01:49:12,751 --> 01:49:18,951
This is something to keep in mind. Okay. So now you have students, you are midterm.

1049
01:49:18,951 --> 01:49:22,011
We talked about that already. Right. You can do it if meeting one vector.

1050
01:49:22,021 --> 01:49:28,521
So essentially of let's say if I have your midterm scores here and if I have your project scores here.

1051
01:49:28,521 --> 01:49:31,821
Right with me as everybody with me. Okay.

1052
01:49:32,361 --> 01:49:35,511
This one has your midterm scores saved, right?

1053
01:49:35,931 --> 01:49:40,101
The sum has your project score saved. I just want to get the sum of middle in the project scores.

1054
01:49:40,641 --> 01:49:44,061
I can essentially because both of them are numerical numerical vectors.

1055
01:49:44,301 --> 01:49:47,451
I can add them up and they will do a pairwise addition.

1056
01:49:47,781 --> 01:49:52,041
The first entry is going to get out of the first one, second to the second one, and so on and so forth.

1057
01:49:52,341 --> 01:49:55,521
Again, things that you can use in a table. Now, think about a table that you have, right?

1058
01:49:55,521 --> 01:49:59,571
When I'm running a regression model, I have one column which might be, you know, let's say, okay,

1059
01:50:00,201 --> 01:50:04,190
let's say an example, but I want to predict your project scores based on your midterm score.

1060
01:50:04,191 --> 01:50:10,191
So yeah, so project scores are y, midterm is y, midterm is X and I'm going to run a regression.

1061
01:50:10,191 --> 01:50:16,550
All your project scores on the midterm scores and the the neat thing Jonas is going to do a better

1062
01:50:16,551 --> 01:50:21,051
wise thing here as right this is the corresponding X for this fight and so on and so forth.

1063
01:50:21,381 --> 01:50:27,151
This is where you just sort of note that because I want to keep putting the bigger picture of why we're doing what we're doing right.

1064
01:50:27,151 --> 01:50:31,751
So, so that, you know, it's not just playing around with r for the sake of being remember that.

1065
01:50:33,141 --> 01:50:45,861
So let's just do a quick thing. You. Final score could be.

1066
01:50:48,381 --> 01:50:52,321
And I know I'm sort of jumping between the assignment operator and the.

1067
01:50:54,391 --> 01:50:57,991
Equal to op ed, but I hope that's not confusing.

1068
01:50:57,991 --> 01:51:02,221
So going to do this right, remember, final score is a new variable that's come that comes in here.

1069
01:51:02,551 --> 01:51:12,181
It stores these values. And if I want to pin that, I can just essentially just write it down here and I get the final score under paid 174 and so on.

1070
01:51:12,181 --> 01:51:16,261
Right. It is just added. These guys are in pairwise formats.

1071
01:51:16,711 --> 01:51:19,971
Okay. With me. Okay.

1072
01:51:24,311 --> 01:51:30,791
Okay. I talked about the boolean operators that the true and the false stuff as well.

1073
01:51:30,791 --> 01:51:34,001
Right. So now this is going to get me to do that sort of thing.

1074
01:51:34,541 --> 01:51:41,590
So what? So and that's why people mostly don't use that equal to operator because that equal to operators

1075
01:51:41,591 --> 01:51:46,271
also use double equal to for a boolean checking whether or not something is true or not right.

1076
01:51:46,721 --> 01:51:52,481
So to avoid that confusion, people typically use assignment operator as opposed to equal to send you what I'm talking about.

1077
01:51:52,991 --> 01:51:56,591
So let's say if I want to figure it out, so I have this vector of programs, right?

1078
01:51:56,831 --> 01:52:03,271
And my mpge I'm just ADHD. Right? I want to see which one of these programs are my programs.

1079
01:52:03,281 --> 01:52:10,491
Okay. So what I would do is control. I used to endorse.

1080
01:52:10,511 --> 01:52:14,111
I think that's we keep pressing the wrong windows here. It's a control program.

1081
01:52:14,651 --> 01:52:17,861
I put an equal to equal to MSCI.

1082
01:52:19,031 --> 01:52:28,731
So what I'm doing here is let me put a comment here. I want to know, Rich.

1083
01:52:29,041 --> 01:52:33,901
Well, which of the program entries are I?

1084
01:52:34,821 --> 01:52:38,651
Okay. But a new program equal to equal to MSA.

1085
01:52:38,681 --> 01:52:45,281
What it does is essentially checks each element, whether or not that that element and the program vector is matching or not.

1086
01:52:46,001 --> 01:52:49,871
So when I run that, what do I get? I get to fall through false, false, false.

1087
01:52:50,381 --> 01:52:55,771
So that's telling me that the first entry is true because that is equal to my third one is true.

1088
01:52:55,781 --> 01:53:01,711
That's equal to immature. Everything else is false. Now you can see that this is the building block for me to subset.

1089
01:53:01,721 --> 01:53:06,821
If I just want entries which are MSA alone, I can use the boolean operator for doing that.

1090
01:53:07,631 --> 01:53:13,481
And that's why this equal to equal to is different from this equal to this equal who is an assignment operator.

1091
01:53:13,901 --> 01:53:17,291
This double equal to is out as a as a boolean check operator.

1092
01:53:18,011 --> 01:53:22,061
Okay. All right.

1093
01:53:31,381 --> 01:53:35,481
Okay. And and essentially then what you can do is rights.

1094
01:53:35,491 --> 01:53:38,641
If I wanted to sort of figure it out, this is my make them score. Right.

1095
01:53:39,931 --> 01:53:44,820
And I wanted to see what's there. And remember, you don't need to necessarily do it or using a fixed value.

1096
01:53:44,821 --> 01:53:49,251
So one thing you could do is midterm bigger that I want to figure out all the students.

1097
01:53:49,261 --> 01:53:52,561
Right? I mean, what the scores were who were more than 80.

1098
01:53:54,001 --> 01:53:57,811
I have followed through to this what I mean by index, right?

1099
01:53:58,081 --> 01:54:00,451
Which ones of them were bigger than 18.

1100
01:54:00,871 --> 01:54:09,150
But it could all do to something like okay, which ones of these rate were higher than the mean of the median for metascore like again,

1101
01:54:09,151 --> 01:54:13,441
mean is a function which I'm applying to the midterm object, which I already have.

1102
01:54:13,441 --> 01:54:18,221
Right? When I do that, I again get this once.

1103
01:54:18,251 --> 01:54:24,161
These were the indexes which were higher or below the the the mean of the mid-term score.

1104
01:54:24,611 --> 01:54:32,621
Okay. All right.

1105
01:54:33,461 --> 01:54:37,151
So now we the we have talked about that already. Right. I want to extract elements.

1106
01:54:40,281 --> 01:54:44,021
This is how I extract individual elements. I can also extract multiple elements, right?

1107
01:54:44,031 --> 01:54:49,850
If I want to sort of get, let's say, elements from the first to the second ones.

1108
01:54:49,851 --> 01:54:54,080
Right. I could do one call on two, which gives me the first two ones.

1109
01:54:54,081 --> 01:55:01,281
Right. Or I could get the first three ones. I could do midterm one call or three, which is 80, 90, 93 and so on.

1110
01:55:01,281 --> 01:55:06,141
Right. I could do something like if I just wanted to say first, third and fifth.

1111
01:55:06,471 --> 01:55:10,671
What I could do is see is a list of entries. So let's construct this step by step.

1112
01:55:11,241 --> 01:55:16,491
Maybe if it's confusing for some of you then. So let's say I want I want to react to the elements.

1113
01:55:16,491 --> 01:55:21,971
I want the first element, third element and the fifth element. I can save them in one, three, five.

1114
01:55:22,011 --> 01:55:27,201
Make a list of that. And now I want these elements from.

1115
01:55:29,111 --> 01:55:34,931
The metal metal. It gives me the first midterm value, the third midterm value in the fifth metal value.

1116
01:55:38,141 --> 01:55:41,551
This is how you're sort of getting. This.

1117
01:55:43,731 --> 01:55:45,141
This gives you the first two values.

1118
01:55:45,151 --> 01:55:49,791
If you have staggered values, you come to the column because column takes all the values from the beginning to the end.

1119
01:55:50,091 --> 01:55:54,231
You want specific ones. You have to send a list inside that index.

1120
01:55:54,501 --> 01:55:58,521
Okay. With me. Any questions about this?

1121
01:55:59,091 --> 01:56:04,401
Okay. This is straightforward, right? I mean, we're just sort of working through basic object elements of this one.

1122
01:56:04,731 --> 01:56:07,401
We haven't really gotten into any advanced stuff yet. Okay.

1123
01:56:08,691 --> 01:56:14,421
And again, these things are again stuff about how do you store values, change values and so on based on the indexes itself.

1124
01:56:17,121 --> 01:56:18,381
Okay, so now let's do one thing.

1125
01:56:21,371 --> 01:56:30,190
So you have students here, these six entries think about I have four different elements, students, midterm program and the project.

1126
01:56:30,191 --> 01:56:40,331
Right. And again, I have six entries in all of them. So what I want now is I want to get all the students who got hired on the mean of the midterm.

1127
01:56:40,541 --> 01:56:49,720
I want to get that from this. How do I do that? So if you remember a midterm bigger than mean midterm write gives me all the

1128
01:56:49,721 --> 01:56:56,201
true and the fourth index values for the midterms which exceeded the average.

1129
01:56:56,201 --> 01:56:59,650
Right. So when I do that I get false, true, true, false, true, true.

1130
01:56:59,651 --> 01:57:04,331
Right. Now, if I pass here students.

1131
01:57:15,071 --> 01:57:19,381
About this in this public. I get this?

1132
01:57:19,861 --> 01:57:27,151
So what is it giving me? It gives me. Inside this one, you passed that vector of true and false is what it is, right?

1133
01:57:27,721 --> 01:57:31,050
So what it does is it reads okay. The first one is false.

1134
01:57:31,051 --> 01:57:36,031
So I'm not going to give you Shawn. The second one is second and third are true.

1135
01:57:36,031 --> 01:57:41,371
So I'm going to give you a loser. Losing Frank fourth is again fourth, so I won't give that to you.

1136
01:57:41,761 --> 01:57:44,341
Tristan, thank the children. And Emily, I'm going to give that to you.

1137
01:57:44,971 --> 01:57:49,921
So you've got Louisa, Frank, Ocean and Emily because they met that criteria of true and false.

1138
01:57:50,251 --> 01:57:55,531
So now you can see how each column can be linked to the other columns based on how you enter these values.

1139
01:57:56,071 --> 01:58:04,111
Okay. It's almost like saying that if I post here, write something like See again, I'm going to pass illustrate.

1140
01:58:04,441 --> 01:58:08,041
True, true, true. False, false, false.

1141
01:58:08,881 --> 01:58:17,561
What you think is going to get me this. This thing that I've just typed on. If I send this student c, d, d d falls, falls, falls.

1142
01:58:17,771 --> 01:58:21,071
What is the output going to be a first for students?

1143
01:58:21,521 --> 01:58:24,521
Yes. And the last will be coming because that's 43. Is that okay?

1144
01:58:24,761 --> 01:58:28,271
Display the first three entries because they were true, the last three were false.

1145
01:58:28,271 --> 01:58:31,951
So we display that having something that's more dynamic than that.

1146
01:58:31,961 --> 01:58:35,351
This ensures it means the criteria that you wanted to meet. Okay.

1147
01:58:35,841 --> 01:58:39,191
I can do the same thing if I just wanted the non amateur students in this dataset.

1148
01:58:39,191 --> 01:58:42,671
Right. So let's do the first m-type students and then the non individual students.

1149
01:58:42,681 --> 01:58:46,931
Okay. It's a program equal to equal to match.

1150
01:58:47,771 --> 01:58:52,001
If I do that, I get shown in front of because they're the image students in my dataset.

1151
01:58:52,751 --> 01:58:59,351
How do I know that? Because the first entry and third entry was much higher right rama here.

1152
01:58:59,381 --> 01:59:03,341
The first and third entry was shown in front. So get John and Frank here.

1153
01:59:03,701 --> 01:59:06,701
Now, what if I wanted all the students but the image I students?

1154
01:59:08,571 --> 01:59:13,221
Just to me you have double equal to implying equal to or equal to. It means it has to meet that criteria.

1155
01:59:14,591 --> 01:59:18,531
We're not equal to. You have this?

1156
01:59:19,131 --> 01:59:23,181
I think so. Like, does I get confused between odd and and Python with this one?

1157
01:59:23,181 --> 01:59:27,021
Because I think they have some different terms for this one. So I think this should work.

1158
01:59:29,631 --> 01:59:34,811
Yep, it does. So when you have exclamation mark equal to that implied, that's not equal to hematite.

1159
01:59:35,151 --> 01:59:40,761
So now in my students dataset, right, except for the fourth and the third ones, everybody's going to have a chart.

1160
01:59:41,331 --> 01:59:46,551
So when I pass that, I get Luisa for her shorthand and Emily as my answer.

1161
01:59:47,481 --> 01:59:59,401
Okay. Questions. Confusion. All right, well, we're here.

1162
01:59:59,731 --> 02:00:04,140
So we do the same thing again. We can just the way we were doing that, we can change individual elements.

1163
02:00:04,141 --> 02:00:07,891
Right. Because it's about assigning those values again. So we do all of that.

1164
02:00:07,891 --> 02:00:13,051
Right. We talked about logical indexing. We talked about the projects where, you know, you have this one.

1165
02:00:13,411 --> 02:00:20,801
So just the way you can create more complex queries in our document, these are, again, you know, commands that we're using here.

1166
02:00:21,691 --> 02:00:27,060
One very basic motion of creating a plot, which is what I never use.

1167
02:00:27,061 --> 02:00:32,641
But essentially, if I wanted to sort of take a quick look at the data, right, as a plot function when you passed the X and the Y values.

1168
02:00:32,941 --> 02:00:40,380
So let's say in this example, I wanted to sort of figure out what the relationship between, you know, the plot is.

1169
02:00:40,381 --> 02:00:46,981
The function which gives the portrayed between the midterm scores in the final scores was right so I see a plot X is the midterm.

1170
02:00:48,121 --> 02:00:52,321
Why is the have the project as the right project here?

1171
02:00:53,441 --> 02:00:58,511
If there's any sort of, you know, relationship between them. Visually speaking, when I run that, I get this.

1172
02:00:59,171 --> 02:01:02,561
This is going to be. But you're better looking if I make a decision.

1173
02:01:03,281 --> 02:01:09,761
So on the x axis of the midterm scores, on the Y axis of the project scores and I have this is a dot plot.

1174
02:01:10,761 --> 02:01:13,640
Now, remember in Excel, what you would have done is you would have had a trend line here,

1175
02:01:13,641 --> 02:01:18,351
right, which essentially is a linear regression model you would have run. And that would have been the trend line that would have come here.

1176
02:01:18,351 --> 02:01:22,941
Right. We haven't come to that yet. But this is just one way of visualizing how your plot looks like.

1177
02:01:23,511 --> 02:01:29,660
Okay. And you can do other things with that as well, right?

1178
02:01:29,661 --> 02:01:33,561
Which is to label your white lie label and so on.

1179
02:01:34,521 --> 02:01:39,051
What I encourage for plots is a different package called Gigi plot package.

1180
02:01:39,351 --> 02:01:41,961
We get really, really nice plots and really pretty plots.

1181
02:01:42,231 --> 02:01:48,591
So for visualization, that's a recommendation, but for basic visual, basic visuals, without all that nice looking stuff,

1182
02:01:48,591 --> 02:01:52,551
you can just do something like this which has, you know, you have the X value, Y value.

1183
02:01:52,911 --> 02:01:58,491
Your main is your title, your label is your label, white label and so on.

1184
02:01:58,591 --> 02:02:04,211
Okay. There's things we do play around with. So I did this one.

1185
02:02:06,611 --> 02:02:10,871
Okay. So now let's come to something that's relatively more interesting, which is called data frames and data sets.

1186
02:02:10,901 --> 02:02:14,191
Right now, we're getting to sort of actually playing with that. The hopefully the opposite.

1187
02:02:14,201 --> 02:02:18,101
I said today, right by the time we come to our I think it's 735.

1188
02:02:19,091 --> 02:02:23,931
So if I. Let's see what we can do today.

1189
02:02:24,831 --> 02:02:28,521
Will we get time? We will get time to sort of finish this one for sure.

1190
02:02:29,541 --> 02:02:36,351
The question is, will we get time to sort of come to the regressions for this one or not?

1191
02:02:37,281 --> 02:02:43,131
Okay. So how about we finish this this lead-acid wrangling, right?

1192
02:02:43,431 --> 02:02:48,531
And I'll show you what the regression function is. But I also want to give you at least 20 minutes to sort of do this by yourself,

1193
02:02:48,711 --> 02:02:54,341
because as opposed to me just having a ramble for 3 hours because it defeats the purpose of you working on it.

1194
02:02:54,351 --> 02:03:00,801
So look, let me try to get through this data set stuff and then we can try doing something with the opioids.

1195
02:03:00,811 --> 02:03:02,721
Then I said, okay, otherwise we have next class for that.

1196
02:03:03,231 --> 02:03:08,181
But the good thing is you all have the base of our now and use the officers you have no one will do next week.

1197
02:03:08,541 --> 02:03:14,450
So the office hours if you want to show up right if you have any struggle with the existing dataset with our Austar.

1198
02:03:14,451 --> 02:03:17,451
But next week we get into the fall modeling and stuff as well.

1199
02:03:17,451 --> 02:03:21,471
Right. And then the base picks up pretty fast. Alright. If it hasn't picked up already for some of you.

1200
02:03:23,031 --> 02:03:27,291
Okay. So let's come to let's come to the datasets now.

1201
02:03:27,291 --> 02:03:33,571
Okay. All right. So I'm going to create a headset actually now by.

1202
02:03:35,981 --> 02:03:41,851
So have all of this money out of the program here. Lots of faith.

1203
02:03:42,251 --> 02:03:45,941
Okay. So now I'm going to create a dataset called Class Records, right?

1204
02:03:45,941 --> 02:03:49,660
Last week, and I'm going to use the function quality, the frame, need our framing.

1205
02:03:49,661 --> 02:03:55,601
Okay. And in the function, I'm going to create multiple columns and each column is going to be assigned a

1206
02:03:55,601 --> 02:03:59,951
vector because I think about what the dataset is if elected as a list of elements.

1207
02:03:59,951 --> 02:04:03,311
Right. And a dataset can be thought of as a list of vectors.

1208
02:04:03,851 --> 02:04:08,741
Right. Think about it this way. This.

1209
02:04:11,361 --> 02:04:29,901
That's not the most helpful. Plus for. So you had a.

1210
02:04:38,031 --> 02:04:48,471
There was much about. So think about the students I talked about is doing better.

1211
02:04:49,011 --> 02:04:55,160
When I had the drive, we had Sean, we had we saw, we had Shelton, we had Emily.

1212
02:04:55,161 --> 02:04:59,181
Right? We had six elements. But think about we have five elements here, right?

1213
02:04:59,751 --> 02:05:07,521
This was the student vector with six elements I had the program vector is about right, but six elements.

1214
02:05:07,521 --> 02:05:12,861
Right. I mean, that's what I had was the last four. Make it clear out. Okay.

1215
02:05:12,861 --> 02:05:16,871
So we had six elements here, six names of students, somebody in program.

1216
02:05:16,881 --> 02:05:26,051
You had my MBA MBA images say AGI images.

1217
02:05:26,061 --> 02:05:33,201
Okay. Again, six elements here and you had the project scores that do three or more variables.

1218
02:05:33,201 --> 02:05:41,541
But forget about that. But I mean, in 594607.

1219
02:05:42,231 --> 02:05:47,931
Okay, so we had three elements here, three three vectors here student four program project.

1220
02:05:48,231 --> 02:05:51,591
And a data set is nothing. And these were individual lists by directors.

1221
02:05:52,011 --> 02:05:55,371
A data set is nothing but a combination of these lists, right?

1222
02:05:55,701 --> 02:06:02,181
So now this is the Glassmaker dataset combining these three different colors, and that's what this thing does.

1223
02:06:02,541 --> 02:06:08,541
The data frame function takes these individual sort of vectors and combines them into a single dataset object.

1224
02:06:09,081 --> 02:06:14,361
So when I run that and I can name the column names however I want to, that's what this does.

1225
02:06:14,631 --> 02:06:18,201
So the first column is called Name Program, Term Project, and so on.

1226
02:06:18,201 --> 02:06:23,081
Right? So when I run this. And Clapper going to do classic.

1227
02:06:25,041 --> 02:06:31,410
This is how the thing gets store. If it's easier for you to sit in an Excel like format, this is going to be helpful.

1228
02:06:31,411 --> 02:06:35,881
Especially, for example, if your dataset had 10,000 rows, right, you wouldn't do this.

1229
02:06:36,271 --> 02:06:39,541
You would do something as you would do view clustering.

1230
02:06:40,631 --> 02:06:44,361
So now you have to remember that one was a one dimensional list, right?

1231
02:06:44,681 --> 02:06:48,371
So I could index it by one, two, three, four. And that would give me each of these.

1232
02:06:48,371 --> 02:06:51,941
One, two, three, four, five, six values. This one's a two dimensional list.

1233
02:06:52,361 --> 02:06:55,991
So there's something else we do for that. But here you have rows and columns.

1234
02:06:56,321 --> 02:07:01,001
Columns are odd features, variables, covariates, dimensions.

1235
02:07:01,361 --> 02:07:04,721
That's how I use those words. I don't know. And these are my rules, right?

1236
02:07:05,231 --> 02:07:11,271
So remember that. Now we come to the same thing that we had done earlier.

1237
02:07:11,271 --> 02:07:13,121
Read the indexing earlier.

1238
02:07:13,131 --> 02:07:23,331
Can you see this everyone in the in all year if you remember if I wanted the first name I didn't name open brackets, square brackets, four or five.

1239
02:07:23,331 --> 02:07:27,741
Right. But now let's see if I wanted the fourth row of the class record.

1240
02:07:28,071 --> 02:07:33,381
I wanted the fourth students all details because now it's a two dimensional area.

1241
02:07:33,681 --> 02:07:38,481
I'm going to use the common comma here, right, to indicate what I want. So I essentially do classroom.

1242
02:07:39,651 --> 02:07:43,161
Okay. You sort of. So here, what I do is.

1243
02:07:44,531 --> 02:07:48,101
And I come here last week as the one indexed. Right.

1244
02:07:48,221 --> 02:07:53,081
So let's forget about this one for a bit. So I do class, Rick.

1245
02:07:54,781 --> 02:08:01,111
Again, open bracket, close bracket. Right now, Cuomo is the one that distinguishes between rows and columns.

1246
02:08:01,621 --> 02:08:05,741
So when I have a comma there. Right. Before the corner comes your role.

1247
02:08:06,661 --> 02:08:09,960
After the coma comes your column. So can I do one last risk?

1248
02:08:09,961 --> 02:08:13,801
One coma? Nothing. I get the first rule from Ed.

1249
02:08:13,931 --> 02:08:17,661
So if you look at this guy here, right, I have Sean and AGI, 80, 78.

1250
02:08:17,671 --> 02:08:24,991
What's all the attributes or dimensions or features or variables for the first row in my dataset?

1251
02:08:26,101 --> 02:08:29,521
Alternatively, if I wanted. Although.

1252
02:08:30,941 --> 02:08:37,621
Project scores for all the students straight. I would do class rep and now again out of the coma.

1253
02:08:38,081 --> 02:08:44,261
But now someone tell me, how will I get all the column values if I wanted all the auditing values?

1254
02:08:44,261 --> 02:08:51,481
What about it? True or false? How would I get that? What's the next step would come in five?

1255
02:08:53,641 --> 02:08:58,981
That's right. So because that's the fifth column, right? So when I do that, I essentially get that vector that I'd saved.

1256
02:08:59,131 --> 02:09:03,721
Right. The one thing, if you have hundreds and hundreds of values, you might not remember.

1257
02:09:03,841 --> 02:09:07,141
What's the index number? So for that, what you could do is.

1258
02:09:08,861 --> 02:09:12,611
Oh. Control C is going to come here again.

1259
02:09:12,611 --> 02:09:17,531
Right. But I know that the column name is called Project OC or this one is ordered in read.

1260
02:09:17,981 --> 02:09:24,531
So good. Also indicated like this on the thing. Remember, though, the case is very important here.

1261
02:09:24,551 --> 02:09:28,211
Okay. So if I don't articulate that, I get the same things.

1262
02:09:28,691 --> 02:09:32,171
So as opposed to giving the index, I could just get the full column itself.

1263
02:09:32,921 --> 02:09:37,480
Alternatively, that is this operator. Call the operator.

1264
02:09:37,481 --> 02:09:44,831
Right. When you do that, the advantage of that is that automatically shows you in your data frame what are your individual column names?

1265
02:09:44,831 --> 02:09:50,621
Right. And if I wanted, let's say, program, I come down, put tab and I get that.

1266
02:09:52,341 --> 02:09:55,821
Yeah. Mm hmm. It uses one, two, three, four.

1267
02:09:56,151 --> 02:09:59,511
Right. I can use it all. So why didn't you buy four instead of one?

1268
02:09:59,931 --> 02:10:05,061
Well, because I was getting the fifth column. Right. So, one, two, three, four, five.

1269
02:10:05,551 --> 02:10:12,921
What did I think? I confused you because I used off of program at the end, so I should have just said this should have been quality.

1270
02:10:13,971 --> 02:10:19,831
So auditing is the fifth column, not the fourth call. So you could do it that way, right?

1271
02:10:21,091 --> 02:10:25,021
You don't even have to go through top as you may. Honestly, you might have an audience.

1272
02:10:25,021 --> 02:10:28,681
That's right. Hundreds and hundreds of, you know, columns.

1273
02:10:29,071 --> 02:10:33,390
So if you knew the first name of the particular column that you talking about.

1274
02:10:33,391 --> 02:10:38,581
Right. So what you could do is you could do classic donors saying you start writing, right, you start typing.

1275
02:10:38,581 --> 02:10:43,501
The thing that's going to be R is going to automatically shortlist what fills that criteria.

1276
02:10:43,681 --> 02:10:47,101
And I just have two of these ones and you can scroll through them and use them, right?

1277
02:10:47,551 --> 02:10:51,151
That's how you could do that as well. So again, ways to sort of you don't get that.

1278
02:10:51,481 --> 02:11:01,050
What if I wanted, though? I want you to sort of use the information I gave you about getting a set of index values from the from the vector.

1279
02:11:01,051 --> 02:11:06,171
Right. So let's say, what if I wanted? On the third and the fourth column.

1280
02:11:07,211 --> 02:11:11,321
Of this data. All values. How would I do that? Can someone tell me what I should write?

1281
02:11:11,921 --> 02:11:16,211
I want the fourth and fifth.

1282
02:11:18,541 --> 02:11:23,391
Actually, that's make it hard. One, the third and fifth.

1283
02:11:25,111 --> 02:11:31,501
Column values from the class clustering dataset.

1284
02:11:31,981 --> 02:11:36,751
And remember, if your common goes into the second line, you have to restart the hashtag sign.

1285
02:11:36,761 --> 02:11:44,220
Okay, so tell me, what should I, what should I pass here to get my all the entries from interested said which

1286
02:11:44,221 --> 02:11:47,341
have the third and the fifth from that column which essentially I think is the.

1287
02:11:48,421 --> 02:11:52,931
What is it? It's. Don't forget. It's the midterm and the auditing.

1288
02:11:52,961 --> 02:12:00,131
I want that for my dataset. What? Right. Someone told me.

1289
02:12:09,081 --> 02:12:13,501
Oh, it's much better.

1290
02:12:14,251 --> 02:12:18,151
This is this is this is how for a struggling with this for a long time.

1291
02:12:18,661 --> 02:12:34,821
Okay. So, yes. How do I get that? When you've done this before or some version of this, you know this.

1292
02:12:38,011 --> 02:12:42,061
You have to put three in five. Yes. All right.

1293
02:12:42,071 --> 02:12:46,171
So should I just put it like this? Come on. Three and five for the common right.

1294
02:12:46,451 --> 02:12:51,931
There's. I forget how much I like a and if I do have colon.

1295
02:12:51,961 --> 02:12:55,291
Okay, let's do the colon. Right. So if I do the colon, I get three, four and five.

1296
02:12:56,101 --> 02:12:59,211
So do I get three empire? Use the scene.

1297
02:12:59,481 --> 02:13:03,231
Yes, I use the seed, which is the list function. Right. And I just want.

1298
02:13:03,981 --> 02:13:08,351
Exactly. Yeah. I want three and five. Yeah, exactly.

1299
02:13:08,361 --> 02:13:14,121
And I get that right. What if I specifically knew I wanted, you know, our project and auditing columns.

1300
02:13:14,121 --> 02:13:18,351
Right? So I could do that again because I'm generating.

1301
02:13:20,201 --> 02:13:25,811
If I wanted the project column and the auditing column. Same thing.

1302
02:13:25,831 --> 02:13:29,041
See quotation marks on the moon. Exactly.

1303
02:13:29,561 --> 02:13:34,721
So you say project and you do auditing.

1304
02:13:35,951 --> 02:13:40,720
Is that right? The gotcha question.

1305
02:13:40,721 --> 02:13:46,241
Forget about it. All I'm saying is that this is supposed to be a lower case because it's it's sent to them.

1306
02:13:46,931 --> 02:13:49,991
Now, will you have a question like that? And it's going to be very mean if I get a question like that.

1307
02:13:51,161 --> 02:13:54,171
But again. Yeah. Okay. So this just to be aware of it.

1308
02:13:54,281 --> 02:13:58,111
Yeah. Okay.

1309
02:13:59,581 --> 02:14:04,800
All right. So where are we next? So we can get this.

1310
02:14:04,801 --> 02:14:08,251
We get the dollar sign we can use, right? We can store these things.

1311
02:14:08,461 --> 02:14:11,641
I can also add a new column again, once mighty. That's at a save, right?

1312
02:14:11,881 --> 02:14:16,531
So let's say right now my dataset has a name, program item, project auditing.

1313
02:14:16,861 --> 02:14:22,901
I can have something, let's say now I know your final scores as well. So I can just create a new column by just doing something like last.

1314
02:14:23,671 --> 02:14:27,211
Let's call it a new column called Final Score Finals.

1315
02:14:28,171 --> 02:14:31,651
And I'd say, okay, let's do this.

1316
02:14:31,861 --> 02:14:41,551
So I want to enter all six values for you. Right? So let's say I was 188, 97 and then 93.

1317
02:14:43,611 --> 02:14:47,331
So assuming this is what everybody's calling the final three, I can just create a new one.

1318
02:14:47,811 --> 02:14:55,011
And now what you will see is when you go to class again, you'll see that this new thing has been added to it.

1319
02:14:55,311 --> 02:15:00,081
The new column has been added. So you can essentially append in your column just using the function like that.

1320
02:15:01,761 --> 02:15:05,031
Remember, one thing that you have to do is when imaginary doing something like that,

1321
02:15:05,331 --> 02:15:11,781
you have to ensure that the number of entries in this new column has to match the number of rows in your dataset.

1322
02:15:12,171 --> 02:15:15,771
So essentially, if I had done something like this right, class rank.

1323
02:15:17,141 --> 02:15:21,371
Great. Okay. And then something like. See, and this is all you know.

1324
02:15:21,881 --> 02:15:28,771
Oh, a. A, B, B minus five.

1325
02:15:28,981 --> 02:15:32,131
So ended five entries here, so I mistakenly added five entries here.

1326
02:15:32,401 --> 02:15:36,731
When I do that, I get an error because my is said a six rows.

1327
02:15:37,141 --> 02:15:40,411
But you have just given me five values to find those X stores.

1328
02:15:40,801 --> 02:15:47,341
So I said that's something sort of, you know, be mindful of. Was her.

1329
02:15:58,541 --> 02:16:05,080
And then we come to sort of this that's a sort of opposite of you have the narration, you can also select specific.

1330
02:16:05,081 --> 02:16:11,171
Now I what it now I'm sort of playing around with it, right? So remember that it's rows and columns so.

1331
02:16:14,191 --> 02:16:20,910
That's right. Yeah. So if I want to let's say if I wanted all France scores, right?

1332
02:16:20,911 --> 02:16:24,071
So I would have said classic Frank is the wrong.

1333
02:16:24,131 --> 02:16:31,351
No, not Frank misses two. Let's do the first ones right. If I wanted the first draws or project scores.

1334
02:16:33,021 --> 02:16:37,251
I would have goodness. I would get this right. So this is what my.

1335
02:16:40,761 --> 02:16:44,511
You to ask Rick. This is.

1336
02:16:44,781 --> 02:16:50,781
And I wanted the first Rose project cause I would just do something like class project, right?

1337
02:16:51,291 --> 02:17:01,251
So now let's combine two things that we have done today, right? The Boolean function stuff and extracting values from the dataset.

1338
02:17:01,851 --> 02:17:13,941
So let's say if I said I want. I wanted France of France projects, cause how would I get that?

1339
02:17:15,061 --> 02:17:18,421
Let's build step by step together. Okay. What do you mean? The final answer had one goal.

1340
02:17:18,631 --> 02:17:25,151
So the question is, I wanted to get Frank's project score from the dataset, the method classroom.

1341
02:17:25,211 --> 02:17:33,561
Okay. Can someone tell me what should go in these two two values over a point?

1342
02:17:33,981 --> 02:17:42,891
That is a. Three.

1343
02:17:44,191 --> 02:17:48,051
Yes. You don't know the rule yet. So you don't know the rule. You just know the name of the person as Frank Kim.

1344
02:17:49,921 --> 02:17:55,230
Instead, Frank typed Frank. So let's do the easy part first project for sure.

1345
02:17:55,231 --> 02:17:59,461
Right. So I do that. I get all the project scores right now and one Frank's ones, right?

1346
02:17:59,731 --> 02:18:07,181
So you say, Frank, you. Again any because there is no.

1347
02:18:07,301 --> 02:18:13,241
So, Frank, when you say classic Frank, as if you're essentially telling are that the real name is Frank.

1348
02:18:14,321 --> 02:18:20,881
But that's not true, right? The ruling is not front. So that's the reason boolean operator that has to operate here, right.

1349
02:18:22,331 --> 02:18:28,121
And I haven't. I have. Yeah. So let's. Let's see if we can do this or not. What if I did that?

1350
02:18:28,271 --> 02:18:32,791
This one work. I think this might be up to we haven't we haven't come to that yet.

1351
02:18:32,801 --> 02:18:38,151
So what if you do something like this? Well.

1352
02:18:38,231 --> 02:18:45,281
So we have to see. Okay. So if I want to get France, if I want to get France entry, what I would do is this.

1353
02:18:48,151 --> 02:18:54,081
The new function called subset OC. I go to class, Rick, which is my dataset right now.

1354
02:18:54,081 --> 02:19:00,801
The reason I've said works is this and how we figured that out is this to a question mark on the console and we subset here and enter.

1355
02:19:01,341 --> 02:19:05,301
Now this one can give a subset of the vector matrices loaded up in the conditions, right?

1356
02:19:05,631 --> 02:19:11,481
So I want a specific draw on a specific column and again, use subset to get a specific row and column for this one.

1357
02:19:12,081 --> 02:19:18,981
So the way the entries work here is right, so you have a subset where you pass the object name, which is what class reunion is.

1358
02:19:19,731 --> 02:19:23,271
I want the condition that I have here is I want the name to be front.

1359
02:19:23,901 --> 02:19:30,651
So my condition here is subset is equal to name is equal to equal to front.

1360
02:19:33,271 --> 02:19:38,541
So this is the. But as and part of this is to make it easy to understand.

1361
02:19:38,541 --> 02:19:44,101
Right? So what I'm doing here is. I want from the virus that's upset.

1362
02:19:44,551 --> 02:19:48,691
I want to upset the rules which mean this particular criteria.

1363
02:19:49,021 --> 02:19:52,740
The criteria that I have is that the name of the person.

1364
02:19:52,741 --> 02:20:03,241
And there should be frank. When I do that, what I get is the particular rule, which means that criteria having the name as Frank right now,

1365
02:20:03,241 --> 02:20:07,291
what I want is I want only the project scores for Frank, right?

1366
02:20:07,741 --> 02:20:13,591
So now I want a specific column. Again, I can use I can use either subset for this or the dollar sign for this.

1367
02:20:13,981 --> 02:20:19,901
Let's use the dollar sign first and then a subset function itself. Okay. But actually let's do the subsurface.

1368
02:20:20,351 --> 02:20:24,011
So subsurface take multiple arguments.

1369
02:20:24,461 --> 02:20:28,511
You have the object which is gastric. The criteria here is a subset.

1370
02:20:28,961 --> 02:20:32,551
And now I want to say I want to get the column name. I'm going to put this on Slack as well.

1371
02:20:32,561 --> 02:20:36,301
So again, this is about for you to sort of work with the data set.

1372
02:20:36,461 --> 02:20:39,491
It is. And say let's let's the column names that I want.

1373
02:20:39,761 --> 02:20:43,031
In this case, I want the column name project.

1374
02:20:48,071 --> 02:20:52,901
But I do that. This is what I get. That's. That's Frank's project's course.

1375
02:20:53,651 --> 02:20:58,061
So essentially what you have, you have this. This is the object you want. This is the idea that.

1376
02:20:58,271 --> 02:21:07,121
That the particular drawing that thing has to me. Right. And that's the column name for that criteria meeting draw in my dataset.

1377
02:21:07,901 --> 02:21:11,111
That's one thing to sort of do, right? I could do multiple.

1378
02:21:11,111 --> 02:21:13,661
Now, this one you can use for multiple different things. Right?

1379
02:21:14,051 --> 02:21:21,911
I could sort of select from here or all the rows which have, let's say the midterm scored higher than the mean score.

1380
02:21:22,151 --> 02:21:25,451
I can do that, too. All that would change. Subset.

1381
02:21:25,691 --> 02:21:32,771
Class record. Subset. This argument here is equal to midterm, bigger than, let's say, 80.

1382
02:21:33,041 --> 02:21:36,941
I want all the students who got the midterm score as above 80.

1383
02:21:37,481 --> 02:21:40,931
I wanted the names of the students. So I think the length is equal to me.

1384
02:21:41,601 --> 02:21:45,310
So when we do that, let's see what we get. So I'm going to just put a comment here.

1385
02:21:45,311 --> 02:21:51,491
So that's easy to understand on a subset of the dataset.

1386
02:22:04,861 --> 02:22:19,261
Criteria. The DRO has to meet his name equal to equal to select the column project.

1387
02:22:21,421 --> 02:22:32,261
Similarly, let's do the same thing now I want. I want to get the names.

1388
02:22:33,581 --> 02:22:41,711
Of all students who have midterm scores bigger than 80.

1389
02:22:43,241 --> 02:22:47,501
So I'll make the job easier for you. I will.

1390
02:22:50,281 --> 02:22:54,551
Now, can someone tell me what changes and what remains?

1391
02:22:55,091 --> 02:23:00,791
The ability to move this for you? Is that is this confusing? Okay, semi what changes and what remains to get that.

1392
02:23:19,251 --> 02:23:22,681
Rethink. Based on what we've already seen before.

1393
02:23:22,681 --> 02:23:25,871
Right. I'm going to put this down. You can sort of do an analogy.

1394
02:23:25,871 --> 02:23:32,201
Step here, right. So here I wanted the raws, which have the name as prime and the column was the project.

1395
02:23:33,201 --> 02:23:37,670
Now I want to have all the rules for risk to make them.

1396
02:23:37,671 --> 02:23:41,581
Scores are bigger than 80. And I want the column name.

1397
02:23:42,181 --> 02:23:46,501
So what changes midterms greater than me? That goes into the subset.

1398
02:23:46,531 --> 02:23:49,831
Right. So I. Midterm. Bigger than that.

1399
02:23:49,981 --> 02:23:51,941
Right. That's what you have here. That's the criteria.

1400
02:23:51,961 --> 02:23:57,101
We have learned about the boudin of it is going to give you a true follow through for that's what's going to give you a right and select.

1401
02:23:57,331 --> 02:24:01,971
We essentially give name, right? Yeah. And that's what he had.

1402
02:24:02,301 --> 02:24:09,081
So you have Louisa Frank for her children and Emily are the ones who have them at dump scores bigger than anything beyond E.T.

1403
02:24:09,081 --> 02:24:13,691
I could also say, let's see if I wanted the midterm scores above the mean of the midterm.

1404
02:24:13,701 --> 02:24:17,841
I wanted to get all the students who have the above above average values right in the midterm.

1405
02:24:18,501 --> 02:24:21,831
I do that and I get this one. These are Frank children and Emily.

1406
02:24:22,431 --> 02:24:28,491
Okay. I think once you understand the basic building blocks of each of these functions, right, then life becomes easier.

1407
02:24:28,821 --> 02:24:34,401
So the hard part is getting all these things done. The indexing, the boolean operators, the sub setting ways.

1408
02:24:34,671 --> 02:24:38,841
And when you have that then is just, you know, it's relatively easier.

1409
02:24:39,531 --> 02:24:41,901
So think about it this way, right? So let's come to our role.

1410
02:24:42,591 --> 02:24:47,781
I'm going to actually end this with a quick linear regression function because I want to still do that, at least introduce you to that.

1411
02:24:47,991 --> 02:24:52,371
It will nest us, right? So this is my dataset. Forget about health care for not right.

1412
02:24:52,641 --> 02:24:56,301
Oh, Rita said when I have midterm scores, credit scores,

1413
02:24:56,631 --> 02:25:04,131
and now this as a as an instructor standing in the sort of, you know, the, what, ten days before the exam, right?

1414
02:25:04,611 --> 02:25:07,670
Like, okay, I want to see predict who gets the highest scores in the class.

1415
02:25:07,671 --> 02:25:10,791
Right. I don't I don't think it's tough to do that at all. I just thought it was an example.

1416
02:25:10,791 --> 02:25:14,390
Right. So I want to predict who gets the highest scores based on what I know about these students.

1417
02:25:14,391 --> 02:25:17,771
Right. I know the names. That's not going to be useful.

1418
02:25:18,381 --> 02:25:24,231
It's going to be useless. And I'm why it's going to be bad. It's actually a very good example because name is a variable here.

1419
02:25:25,461 --> 02:25:30,111
If a mindless sort of, you know, data science person who doesn't have any domain knowledge.

1420
02:25:30,111 --> 02:25:33,261
Right. Throws names into the Soviet space. Right.

1421
02:25:33,591 --> 02:25:37,431
You might get, get, get, get a model which is useless.

1422
02:25:37,431 --> 02:25:40,581
Right. But which might still show a very good performance.

1423
02:25:41,331 --> 02:25:44,351
Think about it. Why would good should make sure good performance. Right.

1424
02:25:44,361 --> 02:25:48,020
That's a hard part exercise for you. Maybe you want to cover some new content next class.

1425
02:25:48,021 --> 02:25:53,781
You might you might you might try to figure that out. But I know midterm and the project scores right.

1426
02:25:54,171 --> 02:25:58,641
Can be indicative of what is caught in the final. Right. So final is my why here.

1427
02:25:58,971 --> 02:26:03,291
That's my outcome that I'm interested in predicting and midterm and the project

1428
02:26:03,291 --> 02:26:07,311
is my X variables right on the basis of which I want to predict the final score.

1429
02:26:08,001 --> 02:26:13,011
Okay. So any new student this pops up and you want to make them score 85?

1430
02:26:13,341 --> 02:26:17,961
I've trained my model, linear model on this dataset. I think you're going to get this as a final score.

1431
02:26:18,441 --> 02:26:23,211
That's what I want to do, right? So let's do that right now because you all know know what the frames are.

1432
02:26:23,691 --> 02:26:28,491
You'll know what individual columns are. Right. And you have an idea of what a linear regression model is.

1433
02:26:29,461 --> 02:26:32,621
So how do we do that in art? That's the thing.

1434
02:26:32,641 --> 02:26:34,801
I mean, I'm sort of jumping a few hoops here and there,

1435
02:26:35,161 --> 02:26:39,451
but I still wanted to because I know this is not a class of art, is a class of learning, modeling regression models.

1436
02:26:39,451 --> 02:26:44,851
Right. So when you use this is what is go word that so that you can then play around with this for the rest of the class.

1437
02:26:46,021 --> 02:26:49,260
So there's an R I can see anything here in.

1438
02:26:49,261 --> 02:26:52,500
Ah there's a functional element which is a linear model.

1439
02:26:52,501 --> 02:26:59,900
Okay. The way the function and let's actually do it will help you write to figure out what that function is if it's a linear model.

1440
02:26:59,901 --> 02:27:03,380
Right. It takes in the model function.

1441
02:27:03,381 --> 02:27:09,981
You pass the dataset or the object in which has the columns you want to do a regression on and you tell what what are the for?

1442
02:27:09,981 --> 02:27:17,571
What's the formula? What's the X and what's the Y? So the way here is, remember, let me put this here in the comments here.

1443
02:27:17,571 --> 02:27:22,911
Right. I want to estimate the final score.

1444
02:27:24,591 --> 02:27:30,560
Let's keep it simple. Based on your midterm score, I'm not even adding multiple variables.

1445
02:27:30,561 --> 02:27:34,821
I'm adding only one variable. Oh, an estimate. Your final score based on your midterm score.

1446
02:27:36,661 --> 02:27:42,061
So let's first of all, create an object. Let's call it a linear model.

1447
02:27:44,291 --> 02:27:52,780
Linear modeling, linear model model, find it okay, make it a meaningful name.

1448
02:27:52,781 --> 02:27:54,250
Because when you have hundreds of models,

1449
02:27:54,251 --> 02:27:58,541
then I'll ask you to compare between ten different models and see which one is more accurate, which one is more biased?

1450
02:27:58,841 --> 02:28:02,051
If you have model one, model to model three, that's going to be very confusing.

1451
02:28:02,081 --> 02:28:07,241
Okay. So rule M and what I want to do is final based on a midterm score.

1452
02:28:07,741 --> 02:28:13,751
My own regression lingo. You all might remember if you've done that. And again, I think different instructors use different languages.

1453
02:28:13,751 --> 02:28:20,821
Right. You regress. Final scores on medium scores.

1454
02:28:22,221 --> 02:28:28,611
So final score is your dependent variable or why write it depends on your independent variables.

1455
02:28:29,821 --> 02:28:33,631
So let me just put that as a buy here. Why?

1456
02:28:33,661 --> 02:28:37,771
Right. Final is my way. And my midterm scores are my ex's.

1457
02:28:39,781 --> 02:28:46,130
Does it make sense what I just said here? So my final score is my way, which I want to predict.

1458
02:28:46,131 --> 02:28:51,321
Remember, go back to your role or we'll feel like that's what gets us right.

1459
02:28:51,831 --> 02:28:56,321
So final score is my wife. I don't want to predict that based on my X's, which is my midterm scores.

1460
02:28:56,331 --> 02:29:02,361
Okay. So my formula is Y is equal to intercept, plus beta X plus some error.

1461
02:29:02,631 --> 02:29:07,821
That's my formula. Okay. So how do I do that here? So I do that by l'm.

1462
02:29:09,881 --> 02:29:13,241
Let us have the names of the one more function that might be handy.

1463
02:29:13,691 --> 02:29:16,301
And in doing the modeling right, so names,

1464
02:29:16,841 --> 02:29:22,451
especially when you have large datasets with a number of variable names which feature names and you do names cluster,

1465
02:29:22,481 --> 02:29:26,710
it gives you all the column names. So I don't ever sort of jump between, you know, class.

1466
02:29:26,711 --> 02:29:30,461
We can figure out the names and do that. I know the class work has these names.

1467
02:29:30,461 --> 02:29:36,521
There's a metal, there is a final score. Okay, so what I do is find those.

1468
02:29:38,701 --> 02:29:42,781
This call is his call. Tell that to the same right so that you finally stood up.

1469
02:29:44,231 --> 02:29:50,001
Metal. Okay. That's your whiten progressing on the x stone.

1470
02:29:50,211 --> 02:29:56,391
That's what I'm telling them. Okay. Next thing that passes the data and the data here is fluttering.

1471
02:29:58,121 --> 02:30:02,651
This is the simplest form of a linear regression model, the one that you get an Excel.

1472
02:30:02,861 --> 02:30:09,611
If I had two columns called The and Project and I plotted that plot there and the trend line, this is what I would get with the same thing.

1473
02:30:10,301 --> 02:30:14,131
So when I run this and I'll do a control, enter. It has run.

1474
02:30:14,311 --> 02:30:21,151
There's a model which is already run. And if you see this one right, this is the model object which saves all the entries in that one.

1475
02:30:21,631 --> 02:30:24,991
Let's see what it has. There's a function called summary.

1476
02:30:26,101 --> 02:30:32,521
When I do somebody linn mod final I get something like this.

1477
02:30:35,371 --> 02:30:40,680
This is what is this? There's a line formula is the finals is wrestling on the midterm score.

1478
02:30:40,681 --> 02:30:45,061
Right. Using the data class trick. And this is how you're looking at it.

1479
02:30:45,481 --> 02:30:48,451
The intercept time is 99.6163.

1480
02:30:48,451 --> 02:30:55,291
So essentially it says that it's a very weird thing because I think if you look at my we are going to do the definition yet.

1481
02:30:55,291 --> 02:31:01,711
Right. So this was your project, Midterm Scores, this was your final score.

1482
02:31:02,611 --> 02:31:06,371
If you want to sort of just look before we go to the interpreting the results, right?

1483
02:31:06,391 --> 02:31:13,171
Let's just do what we call basic visualization. And then because that might make more sense, as do a lot.

1484
02:31:15,691 --> 02:31:19,861
X is equal to metal. Why is equal to.

1485
02:31:21,561 --> 02:31:26,841
As to watch bicycle to find and cross through.

1486
02:31:33,061 --> 02:31:44,471
Okay. This is my class on my midterm on the x axis, my phone on the y axis, and this is my distribution.

1487
02:31:44,821 --> 02:31:48,841
So clearly, based on this one variable alone, right, there's two variables alone.

1488
02:31:49,411 --> 02:31:57,591
Can anyone see a pattern emerging here? Do you think your midterm scores are linearly off or vice versa?

1489
02:31:57,591 --> 02:32:05,201
A final score than a linear function of my project to top five or six data points they write and it's all over the place, right?

1490
02:32:05,211 --> 02:32:12,111
I mean, you have somebody who has a very low midterm score getting a hundred, somebody who was a high midterm score, getting low values.

1491
02:32:12,111 --> 02:32:19,281
Right. So this is actually an example of where the model is going to be very bottom at sort of capturing what we have admittedly here.

1492
02:32:19,281 --> 02:32:24,951
You don't have that many sort of axes. You only have one midterm value, one midterm variable, and you have the final.

1493
02:32:25,281 --> 02:32:28,701
But again, this is the best example of when your model is useless.

1494
02:32:29,061 --> 02:32:32,421
So now we look at our model here, right? Let's talk about the model a bit.

1495
02:32:33,291 --> 02:32:37,431
And you all have learned about P values and significance in your stats class, right?

1496
02:32:38,031 --> 02:32:43,041
When you have three stars, that essentially means is or excuse me,

1497
02:32:43,401 --> 02:32:52,011
that means that that that coefficient statistically significant at the 95%, 99% or so on and so forth.

1498
02:32:52,011 --> 02:32:59,391
Right. So the coefficient of interest here is the beta value, the midterm coefficient, right.

1499
02:32:59,721 --> 02:33:04,611
I want to see how much can my midterm predict my final that one.

1500
02:33:06,151 --> 02:33:12,211
Can someone, let's say, forget about the significance? Can someone just tell me what does this mean?

1501
02:33:12,241 --> 02:33:16,650
Unless you want to write it out for you, because that might be easier than if you don't see that problem you write.

1502
02:33:16,651 --> 02:33:27,171
So. Its final score is equal to.

1503
02:33:28,421 --> 02:33:38,111
99, 46, 46 do plus or minus, actually.

1504
02:33:40,591 --> 02:33:46,831
Minus point. Zero one went on.

1505
02:33:49,761 --> 02:33:54,561
Can someone tell me what this what this means based on what you've learned today?

1506
02:33:55,281 --> 02:34:00,410
This clearly, I just use the coefficients there. Right? The estimates I got from there was that 10.2 was the intercept.

1507
02:34:00,411 --> 02:34:05,691
Tom, and the point minus .01 was the beat item that we learned earlier.

1508
02:34:06,081 --> 02:34:13,171
That's what your equation is. And this is estimates that estimate this is actually quite high.

1509
02:34:14,611 --> 02:34:22,191
So what does this mean? If I were to tell you this is a good model for the model.

1510
02:34:22,211 --> 02:34:28,291
Yes, I'm going to tell you, they feel like they're fine, although it was 99 points.

1511
02:34:28,321 --> 02:34:34,921
Well, you take the midterm would be just a little bit under one final, like it is slightly better on the final.

1512
02:34:36,091 --> 02:34:39,541
No, no, that's not how you would interpret that. So the. This is the intercept.

1513
02:34:40,681 --> 02:34:46,471
This is the intercept. What that means is that for anybody who got the got zero on their metal.

1514
02:34:46,861 --> 02:34:52,491
Right, they would get 99.62 on the fan. Then for every.

1515
02:34:53,121 --> 02:34:58,681
Yes, that's what this means, right? Yeah. So if you had gone zero on your midterm, you're.

1516
02:34:58,721 --> 02:35:03,561
What am I supposed to do on your final? But every one more point, you would have one on your midterm.

1517
02:35:03,861 --> 02:35:10,121
You would have gotten less than that. So let's say if you had gotten and this is how people use this this model is.

1518
02:35:10,671 --> 02:35:16,970
So if you've gotten 100 on the midterm, right, you would essentially get like one 6 to 9.01 times hundred,

1519
02:35:16,971 --> 02:35:20,061
which is point, which is one, and you would get 98.62.

1520
02:35:20,451 --> 02:35:28,641
So that's why doesn't have a right finals for somebody you want zero in the midterm right when

1521
02:35:28,821 --> 02:35:36,051
you don't know the final zero would be 99.62 and final for somebody who had 100 on them and so.

1522
02:35:38,121 --> 02:35:45,801
It would be nice to see you. Minus one zero one times hundred, which is just one, and that would be 90.6 now.

1523
02:35:47,091 --> 02:35:50,630
So essentially, right. That's the two for every one unit increase.

1524
02:35:50,631 --> 02:35:54,711
And it becomes called your your final score was actually going down.

1525
02:35:55,431 --> 02:35:58,481
But clearly that's where some returns are useful for.

1526
02:35:58,491 --> 02:36:04,041
Right. There is more significance to this model. Right. It is statistically not significant at any level to.

1527
02:36:04,041 --> 02:36:07,901
So the p. Value the though senator is a super high like this.

1528
02:36:08,181 --> 02:36:13,421
This is the estimate minus .21. The senator is point one which is bigger than the estimate.

1529
02:36:13,431 --> 02:36:16,521
What does that mean? There's a high variance in what you're capturing.

1530
02:36:16,521 --> 02:36:21,231
You're not able to capture with precision what these estimates are. That's what you have here.

1531
02:36:21,831 --> 02:36:23,421
That's why this model is sort of useless.

1532
02:36:23,781 --> 02:36:30,681
It's telling you this model, that this leaner model shows that there is no there's no relationship between your midterm score on your final score.

1533
02:36:32,381 --> 02:36:37,991
Makes sense. So essentially what it's telling me is that it could be multiple things.

1534
02:36:38,261 --> 02:36:41,951
I'm using a very crappy model. Latina model is not appropriate.

1535
02:36:42,731 --> 02:36:46,811
All my features that I capture, the midterm score, it's just not informative.

1536
02:36:47,021 --> 02:36:51,911
Maybe something else is informative. Maybe if I use the project score along with it, that would be more informative.

1537
02:36:52,121 --> 02:36:56,411
Maybe if I used, you know, whether or not the student does the auditing, that would be informative.

1538
02:36:56,621 --> 02:37:04,511
Maybe this is something to think about, right? If I'd use the name of the student or the age or gender of this to know the reason the student.

1539
02:37:04,871 --> 02:37:08,381
That would be informative. Or would it be people use.

1540
02:37:08,411 --> 02:37:13,061
People talk about the kitchen sink approach in machine learning. Right. That here you have ten variables through all of them.

1541
02:37:13,781 --> 02:37:17,980
That's the thing to think about, right? Why do sometimes equity issues about issues come up?

1542
02:37:17,981 --> 02:37:26,051
Right. Are they capturing trends which won't really exist but are just sort of perpetuating what's a database artifact or something?

1543
02:37:26,451 --> 02:37:29,441
This doesn't capture that. Don't think too much about this from this angle.

1544
02:37:29,741 --> 02:37:34,901
But again, these are challenges that you face when you run engle quote unquote popular's models.

1545
02:37:35,531 --> 02:37:37,721
Okay. Does this make sense what we just did today?

1546
02:37:38,601 --> 02:37:44,060
And I think what I why this is important for us to understand the way our does this right is when I run.

1547
02:37:44,061 --> 02:37:48,561
Now, if I run, let's see a much more machine learning model.

1548
02:37:49,531 --> 02:37:54,240
If I just had the same variables, the finals and the midterm score. But the model is real, let's say.

1549
02:37:54,241 --> 02:37:58,890
You know, this is a linear model, a nonlinear model. Almost everything remains the same.

1550
02:37:58,891 --> 02:38:03,121
The Y is still the Y axis. The the x equals to the data.

1551
02:38:03,121 --> 02:38:08,021
Right. I just have a different function to do that. That makes sense.

1552
02:38:08,891 --> 02:38:12,281
And we learn all about that. We use random forests. We use trees.

1553
02:38:12,281 --> 02:38:16,381
We'll use maybe neural nets. I mean, I don't think it's going to be useful in that one variable or something of that.

1554
02:38:16,421 --> 02:38:22,271
Right. But again, we use an array of sort of models to see which is a more appropriate set amount.

1555
02:38:22,781 --> 02:38:26,111
And when do you even need a model of any variables in an informative like in this setup?

1556
02:38:26,351 --> 02:38:32,621
I mean, the first thing that you would do so let's say you were asking your analyst he'd run a model which predicts,

1557
02:38:32,621 --> 02:38:36,671
you know, funding scores or mortality rates based on these four variables.

1558
02:38:36,971 --> 02:38:41,531
The first thing you should be doing is seeing these basic plots, right? Does that even make sense to me?

1559
02:38:42,101 --> 02:38:44,230
Sometimes they are informative, sometimes it's not informative.

1560
02:38:44,231 --> 02:38:50,141
But here you can clearly see somebody with a super low midterm score and a super high midterm score get the same value.

1561
02:38:50,831 --> 02:38:54,221
So as a linear model appropriate for that? Maybe not.

1562
02:38:54,941 --> 02:38:58,060
Admittedly, they're just six entries in here. You don't run a model on six entries.

1563
02:38:58,061 --> 02:39:01,311
You don't get to model on less than at least 20, 30 entries for sure.

1564
02:39:01,321 --> 02:39:09,821
Right. But for you to be aware of. Okay. So it's 812, but we started the class late, but you were still sitting in here.

1565
02:39:09,821 --> 02:39:15,011
So anyway, you have Dennis moments before we go, right? How about you sort of just play around with the zero set you have?

1566
02:39:15,131 --> 02:39:18,731
Ask Rick, you know what we did right now? Right. See what?

1567
02:39:18,911 --> 02:39:23,231
So one other thing you could do, right? You can apply other variables on that as opposed to midterm.

1568
02:39:23,561 --> 02:39:27,460
See whether our product scores are more indicative of the final scored or not.

1569
02:39:27,461 --> 02:39:30,641
Right. See if program is more indicative of the fund score tonight.

1570
02:39:30,641 --> 02:39:35,351
Right. So if you want to play around with that, I'm going to be sticking around a little deeper.

1571
02:39:35,351 --> 02:39:39,221
So but if you have issues, errors that you learn today, any questions about that?

1572
02:39:39,581 --> 02:39:47,371
I'm going to be there. But the idea for today was to lay the ground for what these models are, what the basic machinery of art is.

1573
02:39:47,741 --> 02:39:52,871
So the next week, we're going to be a bit more informed about this questions.

1574
02:39:55,031 --> 02:39:59,491
Did you hear this when? I was just like. I'm going to put all of them on.

1575
02:40:00,161 --> 02:40:06,251
I can't save this one. I have to sort of copy, paste this entire thing and said, you want the Arco to be also I put it on canvas.

1576
02:40:06,251 --> 02:40:12,261
Or Are you all good with that? Here's a look back to South Korea.

1577
02:40:13,221 --> 02:40:18,261
Oh, really? I just do that again. Yeah, yeah. But please feel free to ask questions if you haven't had one.

1578
02:40:18,651 --> 02:40:21,951
Yep. We want to do that.

1579
02:40:22,501 --> 02:40:25,820
You know what? If you're going to have to do this. Good question.

1580
02:40:25,821 --> 02:40:29,781
Very good question. So I'm going to talk about that in more of your next class.

1581
02:40:29,781 --> 02:40:33,281
Right. But one way to import. So I'll. Fabien.

1582
02:40:33,391 --> 02:40:39,731
Right, if I haven't had a question. Sorry. I mean, I know it's almost time, but from another question about right now, I made the leadership in art.

1583
02:40:40,221 --> 02:40:44,571
What if I want to applaud the data set into I. Right, I didn't talk about that today so you can do that as well.

1584
02:40:44,571 --> 02:40:52,071
You have file you can go to import dataset and I let's say for me it's a CSV file, right form text to it.

1585
02:40:53,151 --> 02:40:58,221
Then I go to my downloads. Right. Me too.

1586
02:40:58,721 --> 02:41:03,221
Oh, God, no, no. That's still important for people.

1587
02:41:03,381 --> 02:41:08,061
I said from tax base. So downloads.

1588
02:41:09,951 --> 02:41:15,380
I'm going to extract that from the zip file. But yeah, I'm going to show it to everyone.

1589
02:41:15,381 --> 02:41:17,241
I don't want to keep you holding, but give me a break second.

1590
02:41:17,241 --> 02:41:33,801
I'm going to show you how you sort of get that dataset as well, because I know what you're doing and.

1591
02:41:36,021 --> 02:41:46,281
All right, so let's get down to file and fold data, set context and this policy is file.

1592
02:41:46,281 --> 02:41:50,990
Okay, so you can and it's different for different downloads as an example.

1593
02:41:50,991 --> 02:42:06,681
Right? So I just, you know, I think there should be a different version of loads.

1594
02:42:08,601 --> 02:42:10,550
Okay, this is expenditures lecture.

1595
02:42:10,551 --> 02:42:18,021
One is is that enough said that I have your right which has each region in the in the in the country right for their population size,

1596
02:42:18,021 --> 02:42:22,640
income size and so on. Right. So when to import it, I said it's a CSV file that straightforward.

1597
02:42:22,641 --> 02:42:30,071
Right. And I see always you can evaluate really does it whether or not you know sometimes you have CSV file with comma separation,

1598
02:42:30,081 --> 02:42:33,171
sometimes you have to have separations so you can do all of that. Right.

1599
02:42:33,411 --> 02:42:36,741
I have a header so I say heading. Yes and I import that.

1600
02:42:37,281 --> 02:42:40,430
So here I want to make sure that's important. Right. There's actually a command for that.

1601
02:42:40,431 --> 02:42:43,011
You want to do all of that so you can just do expenditures, lecture one,

1602
02:42:43,521 --> 02:42:49,671
read CSP and you can give that one more thing for you to remember as or especially and I'll talk about that next class as well.

1603
02:42:50,091 --> 02:42:57,170
But whenever you have saved your source data files, you want to set your working directly as that we come to that next class.

1604
02:42:57,171 --> 02:43:01,671
So for now it's too much of a windows of information. Let's run with it. So yeah, I'm done with the next lesson.

1605
02:43:03,591 --> 02:43:10,251
Yes. Only so I try not to mention.

1606
02:43:10,461 --> 02:43:19,291
Yeah, I guess we're not going to do that.

1607
02:43:19,341 --> 02:43:24,081
He was encouraging me to a possible equal.

1608
02:43:25,371 --> 02:43:40,731
So you don't support impediments? Is there anything you want to hold on?

1609
02:43:40,851 --> 02:43:47,871
I know. I know that when you get out. So you have to wait for long hours.

1610
02:43:49,531 --> 02:43:56,901
So, yes, not that I know how to do so.

1611
02:43:57,021 --> 02:44:15,351
And of course. So when I heard that before, I could I could you know, I'm not sure that I wasn't.

1612
02:44:17,361 --> 02:44:28,731
Yeah, that's how we learned. So unemployment and then I just gave that is something I saw you kind of you know,

1613
02:44:31,881 --> 02:44:44,891
when I was about that way in California, one of them actually talked.

1614
02:44:46,851 --> 02:45:06,141
The current health system we had one time more than one category is something them I love drive and then that is when you know that you need to run.

1615
02:45:07,971 --> 02:45:28,711
All decent jobs on the horizon. Actually, I'm not sure who they are and I'm concerned about that.

1616
02:45:32,541 --> 02:45:44,511
You know, I know they might want you to manage your way through a clinical trial.

1617
02:45:45,801 --> 02:45:51,651
Yeah, I know. But they let you guys out early, you know?

1618
02:45:51,681 --> 02:45:58,041
Yeah, I know, because, I mean, I think, you know what?

1619
02:45:58,061 --> 02:46:10,091
You know, how does something like this I mean, I think that helps you think about it.

1620
02:46:10,111 --> 02:46:30,741
And you can see that I'm just going to I go, I mean, you know, you feel guilty and there are a lot of nerve endings, you know.
