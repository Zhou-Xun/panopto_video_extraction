00:00:03,960 --> 00:00:07,040
Hi, everyone. This is Jessica.

2
00:00:08,860 --> 00:00:17,050
And this is the start of our two week module on immunizations.

3
00:00:19,170 --> 00:00:30,150
So the goals of this asynchronous lecture are to understand why vaccines are both a great public health success and a source of ongoing challenges.

4
00:00:30,990 --> 00:00:35,580
To build a larger picture of the public health system in the context of vaccination.

5
00:00:36,680 --> 00:00:41,930
And to examine how certain U.S. policies impact vaccine access.

6
00:00:44,430 --> 00:00:50,790
So I wanted to tie in your asynchronous reading for this week.

7
00:00:51,940 --> 00:00:55,940
This article by Walter Orenstein and colleagues.

8
00:00:56,950 --> 00:01:04,120
So I think for this article, it really, you know, the first sentence kind of the abstract kind of sums it up nicely.

9
00:01:04,120 --> 00:01:11,110
So immunization has a great success of preventive medicine, just some high points from the article.

10
00:01:12,490 --> 00:01:19,660
Really, the successes related to vaccination are the result of a comprehensive system

11
00:01:19,930 --> 00:01:25,840
within the U.S. and involves a lot of different components that work together.

12
00:01:26,380 --> 00:01:39,400
And despite the successes that we've seen in this country around immunization, this immunization system faces numerous challenges,

13
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:49,240
including vaccine supply, cost and safety, adult immunization, vaccine research and development and bio preparedness.

14
00:01:49,240 --> 00:01:53,860
Those are some of the the challenges that were discussed by Orenstein.

15
00:01:54,610 --> 00:02:01,360
And so I wanted to highlight this table from the or unseen article.

16
00:02:01,960 --> 00:02:15,550
I think that this table does a great job in illustrating the impacts of vaccines that vaccines have had on vaccine preventable diseases.

17
00:02:16,270 --> 00:02:24,579
And so we can look obviously and, you know, the the second column is the number of 20th century annual cases.

18
00:02:24,580 --> 00:02:28,239
And then this article was written in 2005.

19
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:36,879
So they use case numbers from 2004. But when you look at the percent decrease column, I mean, the numbers are just shocking.

20
00:02:36,880 --> 00:02:45,850
You know, so if we look particularly at rubella and congenital rubella syndrome,

21
00:02:46,180 --> 00:02:53,910
we can see that for rubella there has been a 99.97% decrease comparing the 20

22
00:02:54,340 --> 00:03:00,399
cases in the 20th century to 2004 and then looking at congenital rubella syndrome,

23
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:06,969
which we're going to actually take a deeper dove into both of these in the next slide.

24
00:03:06,970 --> 00:03:15,850
But when we look at congenital rubella syndrome, there's been a 100% decrease from the 20th century to 2004.

25
00:03:16,300 --> 00:03:29,680
So I think this just really explains the the magnitude and reduction of cases and exemplifies the the impact that immunizations have on illness,

26
00:03:30,100 --> 00:03:37,059
morbidity and mortality in the U.S. So I wanted to go into rubella is kind of a mini case study.

27
00:03:37,060 --> 00:03:42,219
So to give you a little bit of a background. Rubella is a contagious disease.

28
00:03:42,220 --> 00:03:45,640
It's caused by a virus. It's also called the German measles.

29
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:52,720
And symptoms of rubella are generally mild in children and adults and can range.

30
00:03:52,990 --> 00:04:02,050
Typically, there's a rash, but symptoms can range from, you know, rash, headache, pink eye swollen lymph nodes, a cough and a runny nose.

31
00:04:04,210 --> 00:04:17,800
However, if pregnant women are infected with rubella, then they the their baby can develop congenital rubella syndrome.

32
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:25,870
So this can cause birth defects if pregnant women are infected so that babies can have heart problems,

33
00:04:26,590 --> 00:04:33,400
loss of hearing and eyesight, intellectual disability, liver or spleen, damage, among other things.

34
00:04:34,090 --> 00:04:44,889
And so to kind of put this in context, you all should have or before class, you should watch the very brief.

35
00:04:44,890 --> 00:04:55,990
I think it's like a three minute video from the NIH from 1969, and this was around the start of the rubella vaccination program in the US.

36
00:04:56,380 --> 00:05:01,180
So before the Rubella Vaccination Program started in 1969,

37
00:05:01,480 --> 00:05:12,969
rubella was common and it was a widespread infection in the US and zeroing in on the last major rubella epidemic in the U.S.,

38
00:05:12,970 --> 00:05:21,310
which was from 1964 to 1965, there were an estimated 12.5 million people who got rubella.

39
00:05:21,910 --> 00:05:33,130
During that time, 11,000 pregnant women lost their babies, 2100 newborns died, and 20,000 babies were born with congenital rubella syndrome.

40
00:05:34,660 --> 00:05:40,750
So then again, the rubella vaccination campaign began began in the U.S. in 1969.

41
00:05:40,750 --> 00:05:47,200
And once the vaccine became widely used, the number of people infected with rubella in the US dropped dramatically.

42
00:05:47,710 --> 00:05:51,010
Rubella was actually eliminated from the United States in.

43
00:05:51,070 --> 00:05:59,740
2004. And what this means is that its elimination is defined as the absence of continuous

44
00:05:59,740 --> 00:06:04,750
disease transmission for 12 months or more in a specific geographic area.

45
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:10,090
So rubella is no longer endemic, which means constantly present.

46
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:17,350
So rubella is no longer endemic in the US. However, rubella does still remain a problem in other parts of the world.

47
00:06:18,070 --> 00:06:28,810
And so people can, you know, if people travel or live in other countries and then move to the US.

48
00:06:29,650 --> 00:06:33,130
Rubella can be brought into the US by that mode.

49
00:06:33,940 --> 00:06:41,680
But today, less than ten people in the United States are reported as having rubella each year, according to the CDC.

50
00:06:42,010 --> 00:06:47,590
And these cases tend from stem from, again, living abroad or traveling abroad.

51
00:06:48,460 --> 00:06:51,240
So this is obviously wonderful.

52
00:06:51,250 --> 00:07:00,430
But to maintain rubella elimination, it's really important that children and women of childbearing age continue to be vaccinated against rubella.

53
00:07:04,420 --> 00:07:08,990
So back to our little handy public health pyramid.

54
00:07:09,670 --> 00:07:16,750
The components of the U.S. vaccine system include vaccine, discovery, development, manufacture and distribution.

55
00:07:17,140 --> 00:07:24,370
And participants include federal, state and local governments, vaccine companies,

56
00:07:24,370 --> 00:07:32,230
academia, medical societies, health care professionals and insurance companies.

57
00:07:32,590 --> 00:07:40,370
And I would argue that really all components of the public health system have some hand in vaccines from you know,

58
00:07:40,420 --> 00:07:46,180
when you look at the spectrum of vaccine, vaccine, administration and development,

59
00:07:46,420 --> 00:07:53,560
you know, from vaccine discovery, development, manufacture, distribution, administration, education campaigns,

60
00:07:53,980 --> 00:08:00,130
and then creating policies around vaccine guidelines and then monitoring for adverse events.

61
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:05,829
Obviously, you know, vaccine campaigns have a ton of moving parts.

62
00:08:05,830 --> 00:08:14,710
And so really all components of the public health system are critically important in the US for our vaccine program.

63
00:08:15,960 --> 00:08:23,250
So just to dove a little bit more into that, you all may have seen this figure, I think, and public health 200.

64
00:08:23,250 --> 00:08:25,170
But just to give you a refresher,

65
00:08:25,530 --> 00:08:34,830
this walks through the stages of vaccine development and so much of the exploratory stage of vaccine development takes place at universities.

66
00:08:35,250 --> 00:08:40,260
Much of the development takes place within pharmaceutical companies.

67
00:08:40,680 --> 00:08:45,210
And then regulatory review and approval involves federal government.

68
00:08:46,020 --> 00:08:51,150
Manufacturing and distribution often brings in state and local health departments.

69
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:57,240
And so, again, this is just a kind of a broad overview of the process of vaccine development.

70
00:08:57,480 --> 00:09:02,280
And this brings us into exhibit two of the Orenstein paper.

71
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:11,520
So successfully implementing a vaccine program, as I mentioned, you know, involves a very large,

72
00:09:11,520 --> 00:09:19,640
complex system that requires many entities across sectors to collaborate.

73
00:09:19,650 --> 00:09:22,530
So I'm not going to go over this whole table,

74
00:09:22,530 --> 00:09:30,359
but I think it does a great job at exemplifying just how many different components are involved in this wide,

75
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:38,100
vast system of vaccine development all the way to administration and monitoring.

76
00:09:40,650 --> 00:09:41,010
Okay.

77
00:09:41,010 --> 00:09:56,309
So to take a little bit of a step back, I realized that when I was first preparing this presentation, I was using the phrase chain of infection a lot.

78
00:09:56,310 --> 00:10:02,010
And I just wanted to make sure that everybody is familiar with this concept.

79
00:10:02,340 --> 00:10:11,010
So the chain of infection is important to infectious disease epidemiology and infection prevention in general.

80
00:10:11,520 --> 00:10:17,460
And basically this chain must remain intact for infection to take place.

81
00:10:18,210 --> 00:10:26,040
So if we start at the top. Infection involves some sort of pathogen or microorganism.

82
00:10:26,040 --> 00:10:30,150
So a bacteria virus, fungus or parasite.

83
00:10:30,990 --> 00:10:35,819
And next in the chain is the reservoir or source.

84
00:10:35,820 --> 00:10:46,320
And so this can be dirty surfaces, people, water, animals, soil, air.

85
00:10:46,490 --> 00:10:55,740
It can be a number of different things, but it's the reservoir which kind of houses the microorganism initially.

86
00:10:56,250 --> 00:11:03,240
And then there has to be a portal of exit from that initial reservoir or source, and that could be.

87
00:11:03,900 --> 00:11:14,430
So if we're thinking about a human or animal reservoir, the portal of exit could be aerosols, broken skin secretions or excretions.

88
00:11:15,370 --> 00:11:26,529
And then there has to be a mode of transport that can carry the pathogen from the reservoir or source to another susceptible host.

89
00:11:26,530 --> 00:11:35,890
And modes of transport can be like when we think of modes of transmission of infectious diseases.

90
00:11:36,610 --> 00:11:45,610
Contact droplet and airborne are kind of like the big three methods of transmission, but it could also be vector,

91
00:11:46,330 --> 00:11:55,900
which, you know, typically vectors like mosquitoes and then fomites can be another mode of transmission.

92
00:11:56,890 --> 00:12:01,720
So then in order to reach a susceptible host, there must be a port of entry.

93
00:12:02,170 --> 00:12:08,860
And I'm going to assume that in this case, let's say the susceptible host is a human.

94
00:12:09,430 --> 00:12:15,610
So the port of entry has to be a way that the pathogen can get into this human.

95
00:12:15,610 --> 00:12:21,940
So it could be through a mucosa, open wounds, respiratory tract, you know, several different methods.

96
00:12:22,390 --> 00:12:26,410
And then the pathogen has to find a susceptible host.

97
00:12:26,860 --> 00:12:30,460
And this is where immunization comes in.

98
00:12:32,260 --> 00:12:40,510
So one of the key strategies for breaking the chain of infection is to prevent a pathogen from encountering a susceptible host.

99
00:12:41,080 --> 00:12:49,810
And so the concept of herd immunity suggests that if a high enough proportion of individuals in a population are resistant to an agent,

100
00:12:50,230 --> 00:12:56,080
then those few who are susceptible will be protected by the resistant majority,

101
00:12:56,080 --> 00:13:02,380
since the pathogen will be unlikely to be able to find those few susceptible individuals.

102
00:13:03,840 --> 00:13:12,390
And the degree of herd immunity necessary to prevent or interrupt an outbreak varies by disease.

103
00:13:12,900 --> 00:13:16,950
So I'm sure you all have heard this concept before.

104
00:13:16,950 --> 00:13:28,290
I think it was thrown around a lot, you know, toward the beginning of the pandemic, especially when talking about vaccines against SARS-CoV-2.

105
00:13:29,640 --> 00:13:39,030
And I think it's my feeling is that herd immunity was kind of made to seem like it was an easy target.

106
00:13:39,570 --> 00:13:42,660
And that's just not always true.

107
00:13:43,170 --> 00:13:45,030
So in theory,

108
00:13:45,030 --> 00:13:53,610
herd immunity means that not everyone in a community needs to be resistant or immune to prevent disease spread and occurrence of an outbreak.

109
00:13:54,240 --> 00:14:00,299
However, in practice, herd immunity has not prevented outbreaks of certain diseases.

110
00:14:00,300 --> 00:14:03,480
And so just as an example or as a couple of examples.

111
00:14:04,590 --> 00:14:11,970
Measles and rubella in populations with immunization levels as high as 85 to 90%.

112
00:14:12,780 --> 00:14:17,610
There have been instances where in highly immunized populations,

113
00:14:17,850 --> 00:14:29,190
the relatively few susceptible people are often clustered in subgroups defined by, you know, like socioeconomic status or cultural factors.

114
00:14:29,550 --> 00:14:39,660
So if the pathogen is introduced into one of these unvaccinated or, you know, very low levels of vaccination,

115
00:14:40,050 --> 00:14:46,560
one of these subgroups, then an outbreak may actually occur within those subgroups and then could potentially spread.

116
00:14:47,700 --> 00:14:54,780
So again, this is just to kind of put put everything into context and address herd immunity, which is a very important concept.

117
00:14:56,160 --> 00:15:04,620
So switching gears a little bit, I wanted to touch on some of the governmental policies around immunizations.

118
00:15:04,980 --> 00:15:14,790
And you may remember from the Orenstein paper that vaccine affordability was a major concern listed by these authors due to rising prices of vaccines.

119
00:15:15,180 --> 00:15:20,070
Remember that that paper is written in 2005. So how does the ACA come in?

120
00:15:20,610 --> 00:15:23,790
The Affordable Care Act, which was passed in 2010,

121
00:15:24,060 --> 00:15:32,190
includes a number of provisions to support preventative medicine to ensure access and affordability to millions of people.

122
00:15:33,090 --> 00:15:39,120
The ACA requires that all insurance plans that are purchased through HealthCare.gov must cover

123
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:45,780
31 different categories of prevented preventive health services for children with no copays.

124
00:15:46,260 --> 00:15:52,290
And included in these 31 categories is coverage of the 14 childhood immunizations.

125
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:59,639
These are listed on this slide, and I've provided a link to this slide in this site where you can go to check

126
00:15:59,640 --> 00:16:04,290
out other preventive services for children that are covered under the ACA.

127
00:16:06,690 --> 00:16:11,219
But then you might wonder, you know what? What about before the ACA?

128
00:16:11,220 --> 00:16:15,570
The ACA again was implemented in 2010.

129
00:16:15,580 --> 00:16:21,030
So before the ACA, there was the Vaccines for Children program.

130
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:31,350
This was created in 1994, and it's a program for children up to age 19 who are served by Medicare or who do not have health insurance.

131
00:16:31,740 --> 00:16:36,120
It also serves American, Indian and Alaska Native populations.

132
00:16:36,900 --> 00:16:45,210
And through this program, under insured children can get vaccinated at a federally qualified health center or at a rural health clinic.

133
00:16:45,480 --> 00:16:50,070
And approximately 40 million children each year get their vaccines through this program.

134
00:16:50,490 --> 00:16:53,280
So if we look at this infographic on the slide,

135
00:16:53,280 --> 00:17:03,809
the CDC estimates of vaccination of children born between 1994 and 2018 will prevent 419 million illnesses,

136
00:17:03,810 --> 00:17:13,290
which is approximately 26.8 million hospitalizations, or translates to 26.8 million hospitalizations.

137
00:17:16,080 --> 00:17:25,830
It will also help avoid 936,000 deaths and save nearly $1.9 trillion in total societal costs.

138
00:17:26,490 --> 00:17:36,900
So this is a wonderful program. But thinking, you know, back to the past or I guess recent years,

139
00:17:37,830 --> 00:17:44,459
some states have opted out of Medicaid expansion and health insurance is still out of reach for many Americans,

140
00:17:44,460 --> 00:17:47,540
whether they're unemployed or just can't afford it.

141
00:17:47,550 --> 00:17:54,930
So the Vaccines for Children program continues to be a really important safety net program for children to get their vaccines.

142
00:17:57,880 --> 00:18:03,370
And then I just wanted to talk about one more federal program before we wrap up.

143
00:18:03,820 --> 00:18:07,550
And this is a program through the CDC.

144
00:18:07,570 --> 00:18:10,000
It's called the Vaccine Safety Data Link.

145
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:19,810
And it is a collaborative project between the CDC Immunization Safety Office and nine different health care organizations.

146
00:18:20,260 --> 00:18:26,860
It started in 1990 and continues today in order to monitor safety of vaccines and

147
00:18:26,860 --> 00:18:31,840
conduct studies about rare and serious adverse events following immunization.

148
00:18:33,130 --> 00:18:44,350
So the varsity conducts vaccine safety studies based on questions or concerns raised from the medical literature and reports from VRS,

149
00:18:44,350 --> 00:18:48,250
which stands for the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System.

150
00:18:48,820 --> 00:18:58,390
When there are new vaccines that have been recommended for use in the US, or if there are changes in how a vaccine is recommended.

151
00:18:58,690 --> 00:19:04,180
The Vaccine Safety Data Link will monitor the safety of these vaccines.

152
00:19:04,510 --> 00:19:13,900
It also evaluates the safety of vaccines during pregnancy, and it has a long history of monitoring and evaluating the safety of vaccines.

153
00:19:14,110 --> 00:19:23,889
Since 1990, investigators in this program have published many interesting studies to address vaccine safety concerns.

154
00:19:23,890 --> 00:19:35,770
And so just a few of these examples of studies that have been published are they they evaluated the safety of the childhood immunization schedule.

155
00:19:36,130 --> 00:19:41,950
They looked at whether vaccines contain that contain additives are safe for children.

156
00:19:42,340 --> 00:19:46,180
They looked at are rotavirus vaccine safe for infants?

157
00:19:46,210 --> 00:19:51,790
Do vaccines cause febrile seizures? Are there safety concerns following the HPV vaccine?

158
00:19:52,360 --> 00:20:00,130
So I think this is just a really great example of how a partnership can leverage electronic health record data to evaluate vaccine safety.

159
00:20:03,570 --> 00:20:09,480
So what have we learned? Vaccines are a huge success story for public health.

160
00:20:09,960 --> 00:20:18,090
Vaccine development involves in many stakeholders public policies such as the ACA and vaccines for children have greatly expanded

161
00:20:18,090 --> 00:20:25,650
access to vaccines and the vaccine safety Datalink is an example of a public health partnership that evaluates vaccine safety.

162
00:20:26,310 --> 00:20:31,680
And over the course of the next two weeks, where we're focusing on immunizations,

163
00:20:31,950 --> 00:20:38,669
I hope that some of the things you get out of the content is sort of the history of vaccines,

164
00:20:38,670 --> 00:20:43,860
but also humanizing decisions around vaccines at the individual level.

165
00:20:44,430 --> 00:20:52,440
And as part of your asynchronous activities, you've been asked to explore some resources related to vaccine outreach campaigns.

166
00:20:52,890 --> 00:20:59,460
And in class this week within your houses, you're actually going to be working on vaccine outreach campaigns.

167
00:20:59,820 --> 00:21:05,729
And when this activity was done a couple of years ago, it was very popular.

168
00:21:05,730 --> 00:21:15,660
And I hope that you all have fun with it and and just learn a lot about the importance and sometimes the difficulty of vaccine outreach campaigns.

169
00:21:17,170 --> 00:21:24,220
And so just to give you kind of a preview of what we're going to be talking about over the next couple of weeks or the next two weeks,

170
00:21:25,450 --> 00:21:30,429
vaccine hesitancy is obviously a major challenge to vaccination uptake.

171
00:21:30,430 --> 00:21:34,839
And so we're going to learn more about this on Thursday when we have Dr. Abraham Wagner

172
00:21:34,840 --> 00:21:39,700
come to class and speak with us about the research he has done around vaccine hesitancy.

173
00:21:40,450 --> 00:21:47,710
Mohan is going to provide an asynchronous lecture about global health vaccine disparities.

174
00:21:48,040 --> 00:21:51,070
And then next Thursday, we're going to have another guest lecturer.

175
00:21:51,280 --> 00:22:00,460
Dr. Kendra Stokes will speak with us about her experience in establishing a pop up COVID 19 vaccine clinic in New York City.

176
00:22:02,820 --> 00:22:10,740
So we have a lot of interesting things planned for the next two weeks, and I really hope that you all learn a lot and enjoy it.

177
00:22:10,740 --> 00:22:14,220
And we look forward to seeing you in class this week.

178
00:22:14,820 --> 00:22:16,290
Thank you very much.
