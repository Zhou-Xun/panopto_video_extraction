1
00:00:06,187 --> 00:00:14,187
in which we will learn some basic methods for identifying interaction and effect modification in epidemiologic data.

2
00:00:14,187 --> 00:00:15,187
First, a brief outline.

3
00:00:15,187 --> 00:00:26,187
I'm going to introduce two different approaches which conceptually match on to the concept of effect modification and the concept of interaction.

4
00:00:26,187 --> 00:00:34,187
And then I will give some notation that we use when describing effect modification or interaction, which will be helpful in this session.

5
00:00:34,187 --> 00:00:42,187
And then we will go through some basic examples of approach one to identifying both multiplicative and additive interaction.

6
00:00:42,187 --> 00:00:51,187
And of course, this is the approach that is founded in the definition of effect modification as opposed to interaction.

7
00:00:51,187 --> 00:00:55,187
So let me maybe just clarify what I mean by this a little bit.

8
00:00:55,187 --> 00:01:03,187
So in this class, we are going to learn two approaches for identifying effect modification or interaction approach.

9
00:01:03,187 --> 00:01:09,187
One involves the comparison between homogeneity or heterogeneity of effects.

10
00:01:09,187 --> 00:01:15,187
What I mean here is that we identify whether the effect of the exposure of interest

11
00:01:15,187 --> 00:01:23,187
A on the outcome Y is the same or not across strata of a third variable Z.

12
00:01:23,187 --> 00:01:26,187
And we refer to Z as the effect modifier.

13
00:01:26,187 --> 00:01:35,187
And if you recall back to Part One, this approach maps on to the conceptual definition of effect modification.

14
00:01:35,187 --> 00:01:46,187
Approach two involves a comparison between the observed and expected joint effects of risk factor A and effect modifier Z.

15
00:01:46,187 --> 00:01:51,187
In this scenario, the joint effect of A and Z on the outcome,

16
00:01:51,187 --> 00:02:00,187
why is greater or less than expected on the basis of their independent individual effects on Y.

17
00:02:00,187 --> 00:02:10,187
And again, if you recall, back to Part One, this approach maps onto the conceptual definition of interaction.

18
00:02:10,187 --> 00:02:14,187
Mathematically, both approaches will get us to the same answer.

19
00:02:14,187 --> 00:02:20,187
It just depends on conceptually whether we want to think about effect modification versus interaction

20
00:02:20,187 --> 00:02:28,187
and how each of these concepts map on to the substantive research question that we have.

21
00:02:28,187 --> 00:02:35,187
But first, I want to introduce some notation that I will be using throughout the remainder of this part of the lecture,

22
00:02:35,187 --> 00:02:47,187
as well as in the live lecture. The risk of the outcome Y varies depending on A and Z when we have interaction.

23
00:02:47,187 --> 00:02:58,187
And here I denote this as Rij indicating the average risk of outcome Y when A equals i and Z equals j.

24
00:02:58,187 --> 00:03:07,187
And so for these four possible combinations of the variables, A and Z, we have four different ways of denoting the risk.

25
00:03:07,187 --> 00:03:18,187
So R00 is the probability of Y given that A and Z are not present, R10, is the probability of outcome Y occurring

26
00:03:18,187 --> 00:03:25,187
given that A is present and Z is not present, R01 is equal to the probability of Y occurring

27
00:03:25,187 --> 00:03:33,187
given that A is not present, but Z is present. And then finally R11 is the probability of Y occurring

28
00:03:33,187 --> 00:03:39,187
given that both A and Z are present and these again are risks, which you can also think

29
00:03:39,187 --> 00:03:46,187
of as incidence proportions that we introduced very early on in the semester.

30
00:03:46,187 --> 00:03:55,187
And these risks, of course, represent average risks, combining the proportions of each causal type in the population.

31
00:03:55,187 --> 00:04:05,187
Knowing that we have many different causal types that are theoretically possible when there is a statistical interaction present.

32
00:04:05,187 --> 00:04:12,187
And then we can translate these risks into relative measures of association, for example,

33
00:04:12,187 --> 00:04:24,187
RR11 on the top is the ratio of the risk when both A and Z are present to the risk when both A and Z are not present.

34
00:04:24,187 --> 00:04:35,187
Relative risk of A when Z is not present or R10 is the ratio of the risk when A is present,

35
00:04:35,187 --> 00:04:40,187
but Z is not present to the risk when neither A and Z are present.

36
00:04:40,187 --> 00:04:48,187
And then finally, the relative risk associated with Z or R01 is the ratio of risks

37
00:04:48,187 --> 00:04:54,187
when Z is present, but A is not present to the risk when neither is present.

38
00:04:54,187 --> 00:04:57,187
So this third risk, R01,

39
00:04:57,187 --> 00:05:07,187
can be thought of as the relative risk associated with changing Z from 0 to 1 holding A constant at 0. R10,

40
00:05:07,187 --> 00:05:13,187
the middle risk relative risk that I've shown here, can be thought of as the relative risk associated with

41
00:05:13,187 --> 00:05:23,187
changing A from 0 to 1 holding Z constant at 0, and then the relative risk R11 for both

42
00:05:23,187 --> 00:05:31,187
A and Z can be thought of as the relative risk associated with changing both A and Z from 0 to 1.

43
00:05:31,187 --> 00:05:43,187
And of course these are causal expressions that of course assume or indicate that no other biases are present, such as confounding.

44
00:05:43,187 --> 00:05:48,187
And we can also express the same things for the risk difference or the odds ratio.

45
00:05:48,187 --> 00:05:59,187
I've just shown the risk ratio here. And I've referred to it as the relative risk, as a generic indicator for a relative risk measure.

46
00:05:59,187 --> 00:06:01,187
OK, so let's get into some examples.

47
00:06:01,187 --> 00:06:11,187
So Approach One is the effect modification approach and we will go over examples of doing this for both multiplicative and additive interaction.

48
00:06:11,187 --> 00:06:18,187
As a quick review, multiplicative interaction is present when the relative difference or ratio measure in the

49
00:06:18,187 --> 00:06:25,187
risk of outcome y differs across strata of a third variable known as an effect modifier,

50
00:06:25,187 --> 00:06:31,187
which we indicate as Z. We evaluate multiplicative interaction by calculating the stratum-

51
00:06:31,187 --> 00:06:43,187
specific risk ratio or odds ratio for the association between A and Y where levels or categories of Z are the strata.

52
00:06:43,187 --> 00:06:52,187
And again, R01 describes the effect of A in the absence of Z, R01 describes the effect of Z in the absence of A, and R11

53
00:06:52,187 --> 00:07:00,187
describes the joint effect for both A and Z. And then, logically, it follows when R11,

54
00:07:00,187 --> 00:07:03,187
actually I'll say this using plain English

55
00:07:03,187 --> 00:07:10,187
because it's a lot easier, when the joint effects of A and Z are equal to their individual effects multiplied together

56
00:07:10,187 --> 00:07:17,187
we say there is no multiplicative interaction between A and Z. Just keep in the back of your mind for the live lecture that

57
00:07:17,187 --> 00:07:22,187
this would be the expected joint effect when there is no interaction,

58
00:07:22,187 --> 00:07:30,187
when the relative risk for the joint effect of A and Z combined is greater than the product of their individual

59
00:07:30,187 --> 00:07:36,187
effects multiplied together or less than the product of their individual effects multiplied together.

60
00:07:36,187 --> 00:07:42,187
Then we would say that there is interaction on the multiplicative scale.

61
00:07:42,187 --> 00:07:45,187
And just keep all of this in mind for the live lecture,

62
00:07:45,187 --> 00:07:52,187
because this final definition that I gave is a little bit more in line with the comparison of the observed and expected joint effects.

63
00:07:52,187 --> 00:08:01,187
But I, I think talking about this now helps make it a little bit more clear when we apply the effect modification approach.

64
00:08:01,187 --> 00:08:10,187
So let's do that now. So here I have a two by two table where

65
00:08:10,187 --> 00:08:19,187
the first column shows the strata of Z where it can equal no or yes, it's a binary variable.

66
00:08:19,187 --> 00:08:24,187
The second column indicates the presence or absence of A across levels of Z.

67
00:08:24,187 --> 00:08:29,187
And then we have the incidence rate per 1000 population members.

68
00:08:29,187 --> 00:08:37,187
And then we have the incidence density ratios. So what we would do here is we would evaluate whether the incidence density

69
00:08:37,187 --> 00:08:43,187
ratios associated for the outcome associated with A varies across levels of Z.

70
00:08:43,187 --> 00:08:48,187
So let's start filling this table. So first we fill in the reference category.

71
00:08:48,187 --> 00:08:55,187
And of course, this would be the absence of A across both strata of Z.

72
00:08:55,187 --> 00:09:00,187
And then we just take the incidence density ratio for these incidence rates shown in the third column.

73
00:09:00,187 --> 00:09:09,187
And we get incidence density ratios of 2.0 for both associated with A across both levels of Z.

74
00:09:09,187 --> 00:09:14,187
And so the incidence density ratio for A is the same across strata of Z.

75
00:09:14,187 --> 00:09:19,187
The incidence density ratio for A is 2.0 regardless of Z.

76
00:09:19,187 --> 00:09:22,187
So both of one Z equals zero and one Z equals one.

77
00:09:22,187 --> 00:09:30,187
This indicates no multiplicative interaction. Now, let's change this example a little bit,

78
00:09:30,187 --> 00:09:41,187
so I've changed the incidence rate associated with A in the presence of Z to 125 per 1000 person years.

79
00:09:41,187 --> 00:09:45,187
Again, let's start by filling in the null association.

80
00:09:45,187 --> 00:09:48,187
So that's an incidence density ratio of 1.0,

81
00:09:48,187 --> 00:09:56,187
in the absence of A across both levels of Z, and then we simply calculate the incidence density ratio associated with the presence of A,

82
00:09:56,187 --> 00:10:05,187
and we do this within both strata of Z. We get 2.0 when Z is absent and 5.0 when Z is present.

83
00:10:05,187 --> 00:10:10,187
How do we interpret this? So we notice right off the bat,

84
00:10:10,187 --> 00:10:19,187
of course, they are different. And what we would do is we would take the ratio of the incidence density ratios for A across levels of Z,

85
00:10:19,187 --> 00:10:23,187
which gives us 5.0 divided by 2.0, which equals 2.5.

86
00:10:23,187 --> 00:10:30,187
And this quantifies the amount of multiplicative interaction that is present.

87
00:10:30,187 --> 00:10:34,187
Let's do the same example, but for additive interaction. As a brief review,

88
00:10:34,187 --> 00:10:38,187
we say that additive interaction is present when the risk difference for outcome

89
00:10:38,187 --> 00:10:45,187
Y differs across strata of a third variable Z known as the effect modifier.

90
00:10:45,187 --> 00:10:53,187
We evaluate this by calculating the stratum specific risk difference for the association between A and Y, where levels of Z are the strata.

91
00:10:53,187 --> 00:10:59,187
So this is very, very simple. And we say, more formally,

92
00:10:59,187 --> 00:11:07,187
we say that A and Z do not interact addictively if the risk difference for the presence of both A and Z compared

93
00:11:07,187 --> 00:11:15,187
to the absence of both A and Z is equivalent to the sum of the individual risk differences for A and Z

94
00:11:15,187 --> 00:11:20,187
independently of one another. I've expanded this out here.

95
00:11:20,187 --> 00:11:31,187
And we can actually simplify this equation to indicate an equivalence of the risk difference for A in the strata where Z equals one.

96
00:11:31,187 --> 00:11:36,187
So we have the risk of A and Z combined minus.

97
00:11:36,187 --> 00:11:43,187
So sorry. We have the risk for both A and Z being present, minus the risk of A being absent when Z is present.

98
00:11:43,187 --> 00:11:49,187
And then on the right hand side of the equation, we have the risk where A is present.

99
00:11:49,187 --> 00:11:53,187
But Z is absent. Minus the risk where both are absent.

100
00:11:53,187 --> 00:12:03,187
So we say the A and Z do not interact additively if the risk difference for A is equal across strata of Z.

101
00:12:03,187 --> 00:12:07,187
And then of course, if Z was a non binary variable,

102
00:12:07,187 --> 00:12:15,187
so if it had more than two categories, we would just simply add those equivalencies to this equation.

103
00:12:15,187 --> 00:12:22,187
The absence of an additive interaction means, again, that the risk difference associated with A in the strata where Z equals 1 is

104
00:12:22,187 --> 00:12:26,187
the same as the risk difference associated A in the strata where Z equals 1.

105
00:12:26,187 --> 00:12:38,187
Let's go through an example. So I have pretty much the exact same table here where I have the stata of Z indicated in the first column.

106
00:12:38,187 --> 00:12:44,187
We have the values of A across strata of Z shown in the second column.

107
00:12:44,187 --> 00:12:48,187
I've shown incidence rate per 1000 person years in the third column.

108
00:12:48,187 --> 00:12:55,187
But now we have the attributable risk per 1000 person years in the 4th column rather than the incidence density ratio.

109
00:12:55,187 --> 00:13:01,187
So we've moved from a relative measure to an absolute measure.

110
00:13:01,187 --> 00:13:08,187
Again, the first step is to indicate the null and for a absolute measure, it is zero.

111
00:13:08,187 --> 00:13:14,187
And then we calculate the attributable risk associated with A across the strata of Z.

112
00:13:14,187 --> 00:13:19,187
And in both cases it equals 10. So the attributable risk for A is 10

113
00:13:19,187 --> 00:13:27,187
among those who are and who are not exposed to Z. So these are the strata where Z equals zero or "no"

114
00:13:27,187 --> 00:13:31,187
and the strata where Z equals one, indicated by "yes" In the table.

115
00:13:31,187 --> 00:13:36,187
And we say that no statistical interaction is present on the additive scale.

116
00:13:36,187 --> 00:13:43,187
Let's change this example. Again, we start by putting in the null of zero for the attributable risk and then we calculate the

117
00:13:43,187 --> 00:13:50,187
attributable risk associated with the presence of A compared to the absence of A across strata of Z.

118
00:13:50,187 --> 00:13:54,187
And here they are. How do we interpret this?

119
00:13:54,187 --> 00:14:05,187
Well, we have an attributable risk of 5.0 associated with A when Z is absent and attributable risk of 20.0 associated with A when Z is present.

120
00:14:05,187 --> 00:14:13,187
The attributable risk for A is larger among those who are exposed to Z than among those who are not exposed to Z.

121
00:14:13,187 --> 00:14:19,187
And we take the difference of these two risk differences. Rothman calls this the interaction contrast.

122
00:14:19,187 --> 00:14:25,187
And here it is. The difference is 15 per 1000 person years, we just subtract 5 from 20.

123
00:14:25,187 --> 00:14:30,187
And this quantifies the magnitude of interaction on the additive scale.

124
00:14:30,187 --> 00:14:36,187
And that's the end of Part Two. The next is Part Three, identifying interaction and effect modification, continued.

125
00:14:36,187 --> 00:14:41,306
That's happening in the live lecture on Tuesday, November 8th from ten thirty to twelve o'clock Eastern Time.
