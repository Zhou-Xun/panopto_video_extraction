1
00:00:00,470 --> 00:00:05,910
I guess I can't figure it out.

2
00:00:06,150 --> 00:00:12,730
I guess just maybe it's just the guy. Okay.

3
00:00:12,870 --> 00:00:19,320
All right, let's. Let's get started here. Holy cow. I know you're recording.

4
00:00:19,620 --> 00:00:23,579
I am recording now. Yeah. And so it's like you're, like, front and center.

5
00:00:23,580 --> 00:00:27,000
So you're going to be you're going to be the star of the recording whenever you're talking.

6
00:00:27,870 --> 00:00:31,710
Maybe I'm supposed to be like, Yeah, yeah. Imagine you're sitting right here.

7
00:00:32,250 --> 00:00:37,110
Right. Okay. So welcome back, everybody. I hope you all had a nice winter break.

8
00:00:37,560 --> 00:00:41,370
It sure does. It was so couple general logistic thing.

9
00:00:41,370 --> 00:00:46,769
Most of today is going to be logistics. We don't have any content or much content today ideally.

10
00:00:46,770 --> 00:00:50,399
So this is my first time, I think ever teaching in this particular classroom.

11
00:00:50,400 --> 00:00:56,280
I don't love the rose. I will figure out if we can break the zip ties and turn into group tables of next class.

12
00:00:56,280 --> 00:00:58,700
So if that's the case, what we'll do is when you come in,

13
00:00:58,740 --> 00:01:02,520
just kind of move the tables into groups because I prefer that as opposed to all of you staring at me,

14
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:06,120
which makes me a little self-conscious, although I realize we did that all last semester.

15
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:13,290
Okay, so. So today, all I really want to cover is introduce myself, because I'm sure none of you know who I am,

16
00:01:13,290 --> 00:01:18,779
and you've completely forgotten and basically just talk about what is going to be new in this class.

17
00:01:18,780 --> 00:01:22,560
The reason I keep looking around is there's a couple of new people, but they don't appear to be here.

18
00:01:22,800 --> 00:01:27,180
So for everybody else, I mean, people who weren't in six, eight that are registered for this class.

19
00:01:27,990 --> 00:01:31,620
So for those people, they're really like super confused. We're like, Oh my God, what a great craft.

20
00:01:31,620 --> 00:01:36,360
And so but for all of you who are pros at that, it'll be pretty straightforward.

21
00:01:38,220 --> 00:01:43,290
And then we'll talk a little bit about what is different in this course, about general stuff, about the content.

22
00:01:44,130 --> 00:01:45,570
I'll talk about this more in a few minutes.

23
00:01:45,570 --> 00:01:52,200
But one of the challenges of this class is, you know, the other class with three nutrients and we had like ten lectures for nutrients, give or take.

24
00:01:52,620 --> 00:02:00,689
This class was like 27 nutrients and there's only 18 classes. So there is historically there's only there's a couple of ways people teach this class.

25
00:02:00,690 --> 00:02:03,719
And I've decided to completely rearrange the way things are taught because I think

26
00:02:03,720 --> 00:02:06,870
sort of the nutrients of the day method makes it sort of like easy to be like,

27
00:02:06,870 --> 00:02:11,159
All right, I've learned everything I need to learn about copper and I will now forget about it because had a midterm, right?

28
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:12,930
So I'm going to try to integrate things a little bit better.

29
00:02:13,140 --> 00:02:19,830
And but to do that, what Drew Drew and I did that's over here came up with a sort of a general framework for all nutrients.

30
00:02:19,830 --> 00:02:25,980
So we're going to try to apply to every class. So there's a little bit of consistency, and we'll talk a little more about that in a minute.

31
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:30,330
Okay. So as you know, my name is David is a professor of nutrition.

32
00:02:30,330 --> 00:02:34,290
Not all of you know this, but you may have forgotten I'm Canadian. I've never taken nutrition class in my life.

33
00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:38,790
And so all of you have, which is great. So now all of you have that experience.

34
00:02:38,790 --> 00:02:41,889
I'll be leaning on you heavily to to help. To help teach.

35
00:02:41,890 --> 00:02:47,010
So I'm not going to spend too much time. I think all of you know enough about me but general who is so that is new about

36
00:02:47,010 --> 00:02:52,710
of the semester is going to be our GSI you're going to introduce yourself.

37
00:02:54,390 --> 00:03:01,530
Hello, everyone. My name is Jim and I must say the students in the sciences and I study interests interest.

38
00:03:02,170 --> 00:03:05,150
Nevertheless, the exposure was antioxidant intervention.

39
00:03:05,160 --> 00:03:13,469
I'm working with Dr. Lee and Dr. Petersen, my hometown of Chengdu, a city in the southwest of China, which is famous for this scientifically.

40
00:03:13,470 --> 00:03:21,990
It's also the hometown of Pandas. And I finished my undergrad in Nebraska and come to Michigan in 2020, 22.

41
00:03:22,350 --> 00:03:27,540
I took this class two years ago, and this is my first time I've been outside and very excited about this.

42
00:03:28,140 --> 00:03:33,720
And Tom and Jerry is one of my favorite How to Live and Work with Animals.

43
00:03:34,050 --> 00:03:42,209
And also I have a cat whose name is Taco. Yeah, I'm still trying to find my way of principles, man.

44
00:03:42,210 --> 00:03:45,570
So if I can answer that, like, not, right?

45
00:03:45,810 --> 00:03:51,959
Just correct me, by the way, and that's I think you have some empathy for Jerry.

46
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:54,390
You all know we all know all of you. He's new.

47
00:03:55,170 --> 00:04:01,080
And so it'll take a little bit a while for him to kind of get to get to know you all that and think he's going to do a great job.

48
00:04:02,580 --> 00:04:05,610
I did not know that I'm offended that all pandas are from the Chengdu region.

49
00:04:06,900 --> 00:04:08,860
Just that's like the capital. That's you. Something you claim, right?

50
00:04:08,880 --> 00:04:12,800
Like we claim also Europe comes from Ontario and Vermont is like, no, no, no, we have sirup too.

51
00:04:12,810 --> 00:04:22,350
So okay. So like I said, if you've not taken nutrition security last semester, I think I already sent you an email.

52
00:04:22,350 --> 00:04:29,460
If not, combine the after. So rather than go through all of detail to what great cocktails, which most of you are probably familiar with,

53
00:04:29,700 --> 00:04:33,720
I'm just going to kind of go through a little bit about what is different between that because most things are using.

54
00:04:34,050 --> 00:04:39,030
So the format similar, we're talking news grade craft, the class format is going to be basically the same.

55
00:04:39,030 --> 00:04:45,240
There's going to be a video and a reading with perusal and then I'm going to lecture a little bit and they'll be some activities that'll be pretty,

56
00:04:45,510 --> 00:04:50,970
pretty similar. All of the news posts, seminar posts, article posts, social media, online posts are all the same.

57
00:04:51,540 --> 00:04:58,290
Not obviously about macronutrients anymore, but that's the process of that is the same research, presentations, reports.

58
00:04:58,290 --> 00:05:01,439
All of those are the same for food of the day and peer review.

59
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:04,980
All that is going to be the same. And then there's still going be two midterms instead of three.

60
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:09,990
And so there'll be I think it's right before right before Fallbrook or whenever that when the midterms.

61
00:05:10,260 --> 00:05:13,910
Yeah, yeah. Right before so another me two. So that'll be worth three points each.

62
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:17,820
And so hopefully the three break down are like the two of them.

63
00:05:20,190 --> 00:05:25,020
Yeah. So they're both going to be the same often. We were, I want to say three more points each.

64
00:05:25,260 --> 00:05:33,479
So the total sum of them is the same and they're both equally and they'll be the same sort of multiple choice and short

65
00:05:33,480 --> 00:05:39,059
answer format for those of you who are trying to sign up for Food of the day already and realize the document is locked,

66
00:05:39,060 --> 00:05:44,340
that is like not an accident. So I will unlock it after this class when I get back to my office.

67
00:05:44,460 --> 00:05:44,790
Okay.

68
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:51,120
That seems like the fairest thing to do as opposed to I looked at earlier and those of you who are trying to get away for your families for the week,

69
00:05:52,020 --> 00:05:56,640
we're trying this out. Okay. So the format, most of the things are the same.

70
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:01,680
So what is different? So I didn't love how Piazza worked.

71
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:07,049
This is no fault of any of you, but I didn't love some of the way that Piazza looked or how accessible it was.

72
00:06:07,050 --> 00:06:13,350
So instead of using Piazza as our discussion board, I'm going to try this yellow dig tool, which I've heard good things about.

73
00:06:14,280 --> 00:06:17,370
It kind of looks like a Twitter you get to a through canvas.

74
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:22,350
So all discussion board things, comments, questions and things like that that would have previously gone on.

75
00:06:22,350 --> 00:06:26,160
Piazza will go on on Yelp. But as I said, there's one less midterm.

76
00:06:27,090 --> 00:06:30,450
And yeah, for problem relief.

77
00:06:30,690 --> 00:06:34,530
There is no problem that this is my first time teaching this class. I do not have a thousand questions pre-roll.

78
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:39,700
No matter how hard I worked over the semester, I am going to try.

79
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:47,520
I'm not going to guarantee that. But what if my plan for probabilities is that if there is enough good multiple choice questions,

80
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:52,380
submissions that you guys write, then I'll use those to try to put them in problem roulette as fast as we can.

81
00:06:52,620 --> 00:06:56,460
If it turns out not many people are doing the multiple choice activity,

82
00:06:56,670 --> 00:06:59,760
then they're probably not worth it because in primary that one only had like five or six questions.

83
00:06:59,760 --> 00:07:07,350
So that's sort of my plan. So right now there is nothing and I'll keep you guys updated as we get closer to the first midterm on on how that works.

84
00:07:07,350 --> 00:07:13,259
Because I know I think like 80% of you at least self-reported that you'd probably at some point.

85
00:07:13,260 --> 00:07:17,130
I know a lot of you really like that. And I don't know if you had the thoughts or concerns about how it could be improved.

86
00:07:17,940 --> 00:07:20,550
But, you know, it's I certainly think it's a good tool.

87
00:07:21,210 --> 00:07:26,580
The other big difference is right now, there is a lot less of the bonus enrichment group type activities.

88
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:30,720
That's because I don't have seven years worth of experience of being like, hey, this would make for a great activity.

89
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:34,730
And so we will try to populate those as we go. So, you know,

90
00:07:34,740 --> 00:07:38,459
it doesn't look like there's that many right now as things come up and I sort of see what

91
00:07:38,460 --> 00:07:41,760
you guys are interested in from things you say in class or things you say on perusal.

92
00:07:41,850 --> 00:07:45,360
We'll try to develop more activities to go on there, but there's not that many yet.

93
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:49,499
But you can probably bank on there will be some as they come up throughout the semester.

94
00:07:49,500 --> 00:07:53,190
Right. So even if you try to do great, predict right now they won't be there, but they will be some.

95
00:07:54,770 --> 00:07:55,340
In the future.

96
00:07:55,370 --> 00:08:00,770
There's a couple of things we added, which I'll talk about in a minute, that are going to kind of make up some of that potential points shortfall.

97
00:08:00,830 --> 00:08:04,400
Right. So the total points right now that you can get is almost the same.

98
00:08:04,580 --> 00:08:08,240
Like if you were crazy and did all the activities, which would be like 3800 points.

99
00:08:08,510 --> 00:08:12,860
That's about the same as what you could have done last semester. So I'm not that worried about that.

100
00:08:12,860 --> 00:08:17,840
But I, you know, like I said, because we have two big midterms instead of three, there's like less opportunities for for fixing things like that.

101
00:08:18,920 --> 00:08:24,340
And again, if you're if you're new and you don't know what I'm talking about, the points by me and I will explain that.

102
00:08:24,920 --> 00:08:29,480
So a couple of these things that are going to be new.

103
00:08:29,690 --> 00:08:35,260
So what we've got is a new category here, which are called nutrient specific details.

104
00:08:35,270 --> 00:08:40,820
And so basically what the idea is, is are sort of four things you could do. These would all be roughly nutrient specific.

105
00:08:40,850 --> 00:08:46,940
So next Monday, we're going to talk about choline, which you should all be familiar with because we talked a lot last semester.

106
00:08:48,140 --> 00:08:52,280
So there's a bunch of different ways that you can engage into a deep dive into, obviously, the food of the day.

107
00:08:52,520 --> 00:09:01,030
Hopefully, it has choline or something in it. So this is an activity where you would go through what is the basis by which the DRI was set.

108
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:05,359
So what was the data they used for? How did they decide? Last semester,

109
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:11,690
we talked a little bit about fiber and how the drive for fiber was set based on looking at who got cardiovascular disease versus how much fiber.

110
00:09:12,170 --> 00:09:14,780
And you could argue a bunch of different ways you would set that you are for five

111
00:09:14,780 --> 00:09:19,610
or maybe you're interested in the microbiome or your student IBS or something,

112
00:09:20,060 --> 00:09:23,480
but that's what they did. So for every nutrient you have the opportunity.

113
00:09:23,510 --> 00:09:27,260
One person will have the opportunity to sign up to do a deep dive in the DRI.

114
00:09:27,470 --> 00:09:33,350
I will give you information about where you can find that information. That'll be a presentation in class if you do that, if somebody doesn't do it.

115
00:09:33,890 --> 00:09:38,959
But I think that'll be a good sort of activity on any specific thing. So these are both be like presentations.

116
00:09:38,960 --> 00:09:43,850
There's the same sign up sheet which is here and again will be unlocked as soon as we get back to office.

117
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:47,990
In terms of outside of the class, for each nutrient, there's sort of two different projects.

118
00:09:48,020 --> 00:09:51,049
A one is what I'm calling nutrient effectors.

119
00:09:51,050 --> 00:09:57,620
So it's like a bioinformatic analysis of like what do all of the iron binding proteins do or what do all the calcium binding proteins do?

120
00:09:57,770 --> 00:10:01,190
So that's a way to kind of explore a little more deeply what a nutrient does.

121
00:10:01,190 --> 00:10:06,769
And then genetics is looking at genetic variants into the transporter metabolism, that particular nutrient,

122
00:10:06,770 --> 00:10:13,370
and how does that relate to disease or sufficiency levels or things like that that you can do each of these twice?

123
00:10:13,640 --> 00:10:20,060
You can do each of these once, yeah. If you are doing Heat of the day and the your eyes, you have to do them on the same day.

124
00:10:20,330 --> 00:10:24,260
No, no, you probably don't. Ideally you can.

125
00:10:24,740 --> 00:10:32,030
I would recommend again that you can do one of each of these once, but try not do it on the same day just for your own, your own sanity.

126
00:10:32,750 --> 00:10:33,409
You can if you want.

127
00:10:33,410 --> 00:10:39,470
But like that seems like a lot to do unless you're just like, no, like on March 22nd, I'm going to be like walked in and ready to go.

128
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:43,970
Okay. Does anybody have any information about these on? Great track. More details.

129
00:10:43,970 --> 00:10:47,570
If you have questions about these, it's going to be any questions about the new type stuff.

130
00:10:48,410 --> 00:10:53,330
You'll notice now they're like QR codes because now the thing that makes the links also has a QR code generator.

131
00:10:53,510 --> 00:10:58,970
So that's just a QR code. If you want to type in the which when we print out slides which we'll do next class, you could just get I don't know,

132
00:10:59,480 --> 00:11:08,180
you could probably scan it from where you're sitting, but ah okay so that sort of methodology type stuff.

133
00:11:08,900 --> 00:11:12,260
So what are we learning about this class, I'm told is called vitamins and minerals.

134
00:11:12,260 --> 00:11:15,770
So that's what we're learning. So like I said, there's 27 of them.

135
00:11:15,980 --> 00:11:20,719
They're broadly categorized into three groups. Vitamins, major minerals and trace minerals.

136
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:24,830
The difference between beer minerals and trace minerals is really due to concentration.

137
00:11:25,250 --> 00:11:28,940
Some things like sodium, potassium. We get a ton of some things like selenium and copper.

138
00:11:29,150 --> 00:11:32,240
We have very, very little of it's low in our food, low in our bodies.

139
00:11:32,960 --> 00:11:36,800
They all have important roles. So we're going to talk about all of them separately.

140
00:11:37,700 --> 00:11:41,989
Okay. So the first thing is now I feel like I've been talking for so much is what I want you guys

141
00:11:41,990 --> 00:11:47,180
to do is go to yonder really link slash QR code link and it should send you to a Google doc.

142
00:11:47,570 --> 00:11:53,540
And what I want you to do, because I'm sure you spent all the break thinking about what you wanted to learn about for vitamins,

143
00:11:53,540 --> 00:11:58,219
minerals, come up with a couple of ideas of specific or general things you want to learn about,

144
00:11:58,220 --> 00:12:03,830
either in general about vitamins, minerals, or specifically like I really want to understand something,

145
00:12:03,830 --> 00:12:05,750
blah blah blah about copper or whatever, right?

146
00:12:05,750 --> 00:12:12,230
So I want you to come in, come up with two ideas of your own, add them to the list, and then after 5 minutes or so,

147
00:12:12,830 --> 00:12:17,959
what I'll do is I will ask you to stop writing ideas and then go through everybody else's ideas.

148
00:12:17,960 --> 00:12:20,740
And if you think, Oh yeah, that to put a little star next to it, right?

149
00:12:20,900 --> 00:12:25,160
We're going to use that for some of our in class activities to sort of frame making sure that if we're going to

150
00:12:25,160 --> 00:12:29,880
come up with an example of why something might matter or at least intersecting it with your guy who's interested,

151
00:12:30,380 --> 00:12:35,510
does that make sense? Okay, so hopefully the link works and if Junior can check.

152
00:12:35,630 --> 00:12:40,400
And then like I said, Junior and I will just circle around it, make sure that you're working hard on this.

153
00:12:41,090 --> 00:12:45,590
And meantime, you guys can hear me in the back from I don't have to raise my voice or anything.

154
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:50,090
There's a lot of weight threads in this class, too, so it was really good.

155
00:12:58,420 --> 00:13:10,990
Yeah. I just heard, like.

156
00:13:35,070 --> 00:14:11,850
And. The.

157
00:14:35,660 --> 00:15:08,360
Yes. Actually, now that I think about it, we didn't.

158
00:15:08,600 --> 00:15:11,209
He's here from the engine room. When you put the staff and stuff,

159
00:15:11,210 --> 00:15:16,010
you've got your things written through and start putting asterisk next to the other things I should put in at the beginning, not at the end.

160
00:15:16,730 --> 00:15:24,580
So like start before them. Some really easier to kind of finance or spend a couple minutes in Houston.

161
00:15:24,890 --> 00:15:49,730
This is. No.

162
00:16:16,650 --> 00:16:22,980
All right. That's enough space for two people to be three.

163
00:16:46,670 --> 00:17:11,570
They put themselves away for their record. One couple.

164
00:17:40,100 --> 00:17:43,180
You guys need more time or. Okay.

165
00:17:43,500 --> 00:17:46,670
Ah, we can keep looking at that, but that's not going anywhere.

166
00:17:46,680 --> 00:17:56,339
So. Okay. So organizationally the way that we source reorganized the content here is we're going to start with one carbon

167
00:17:56,340 --> 00:18:02,399
metabolism and iron and that is going to lead us into one whole class that is going to be specifically about anemia,

168
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:08,040
which you may be surprised to learn has to do with iron. Then we're going to go into minerals and cofactors,

169
00:18:08,040 --> 00:18:12,540
then we're going to go on to nutrients and hormones that's going to finish with calcium phosphate and vitamin D.

170
00:18:12,540 --> 00:18:17,040
So then we're going to have a whole lecture associated specifically with bone homeostasis and osteoporosis.

171
00:18:17,250 --> 00:18:22,559
Our plan right now is to make those two underlying all those three underlying things, more like case study examples,

172
00:18:22,560 --> 00:18:30,300
right to work and spend a few weeks on each of the nutrients and then go through a few different ways by which bone anemia or hypertension may,

173
00:18:30,540 --> 00:18:35,009
may work. Then we're going to we want to antioxidants, cofactors and regulation of macronutrients,

174
00:18:35,010 --> 00:18:38,250
and then we're going to finish with electrolytes, water balance and hypertension.

175
00:18:38,310 --> 00:18:38,459
Okay.

176
00:18:38,460 --> 00:18:44,430
So that's how that's why it may seem a little a little strange when you look at the order of these things, but there is there is sort of a method of,

177
00:18:45,660 --> 00:18:49,650
okay, so this is like 100% of the content I'm going to give you today, which is going to be very, very superficial.

178
00:18:50,070 --> 00:18:54,899
So just a quick general intro to however nutrient is going to behave, right?

179
00:18:54,900 --> 00:19:00,690
So I'm going to start with sort of general processes here. So we get our nutrients and food in nutrition.

180
00:19:00,690 --> 00:19:04,410
So that shouldn't be a surprise. It may surprise you to know that they all have different structural forms.

181
00:19:04,470 --> 00:19:08,459
So that's why they are different, different shapes. You also might get it as an additive or a supplement.

182
00:19:08,460 --> 00:19:12,510
So we're going to talk a lot about food fortification programs, usually food fortification program.

183
00:19:12,520 --> 00:19:17,129
That's always the same chemical. Those are then modified or just like with macronutrients,

184
00:19:17,130 --> 00:19:23,970
by cooking and digestion into various different some forms of whatever that nutrient is always but not always.

185
00:19:23,970 --> 00:19:31,560
But usually they all then have to get absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract into our oh man, sorry.

186
00:19:31,620 --> 00:19:38,100
It was like a really cool animation that just did not work. I spent I spent a really long time on those guys anyways.

187
00:19:38,340 --> 00:19:44,880
Those should have like swooped across the screen. Just imagine, just close your eyes and imagine them swooping across the screen.

188
00:19:45,450 --> 00:19:49,230
But the point is, even though they are in different forms, different chemical forms,

189
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:54,360
in our food and in our bodies, usually the absorption of them is specific to some subset of the chemical forms.

190
00:19:54,600 --> 00:19:57,419
So for example, iron heme iron is absorbed much better.

191
00:19:57,420 --> 00:20:03,510
So you can imagine this mechanism you are compared to Fahrenheit or ferrous iron which are in our food but not absorbed that quickly.

192
00:20:03,510 --> 00:20:10,800
I should know better just to trust the animation. Those nutrients can all go off and have some sort of biological function and then they're usually

193
00:20:11,130 --> 00:20:15,720
at various rates excreted from our body and almost all of these steps are potentially regulated.

194
00:20:15,720 --> 00:20:20,970
My argument is that probably all of these are regulated, but relative to macronutrients,

195
00:20:20,970 --> 00:20:24,390
what you'll find in this class is that we know a lot less about.

196
00:20:24,390 --> 00:20:28,980
Whole lot of these are right now, some of them we know a lot of we know a lot about how calcium homeostasis is managed,

197
00:20:28,980 --> 00:20:33,809
a lot of bone anemia, something we know almost nothing about. Right. So like, for example, copper, we know there's some regulation of copper uptake.

198
00:20:33,810 --> 00:20:39,720
We have no idea what the signals are for that. But that's sort of the general path for for all of these nutrients.

199
00:20:39,990 --> 00:20:45,930
So there is because of that, depending on the nutrient, there's a lot of variance in what we know.

200
00:20:46,110 --> 00:20:51,959
We know about the same amount of protein, carbs and fats, but for some nutrients we know a ton and some we know very little.

201
00:20:51,960 --> 00:20:56,790
So what that's going to mean is some of the readings are going to be pretty long and pretty in-depth, like, for example, iron, calcium, vitamin D.

202
00:20:57,120 --> 00:21:00,570
And some of them are going to be really, really sharp, like selenium, copper, manganese.

203
00:21:00,750 --> 00:21:04,170
And that's just because not necessarily they're less or more important, but we just know less about them.

204
00:21:04,650 --> 00:21:08,760
And as such, I'm going to have probably a lot less to say, although I usually have a lot of stuff to say.

205
00:21:09,960 --> 00:21:14,250
So my goal, and I've probably given you this analogy, almost every one of you,

206
00:21:14,280 --> 00:21:19,829
maybe individually over the course of last semester, is to get us from paleo facts to organized clauses, right?

207
00:21:19,830 --> 00:21:21,450
So I think of knowledge as a pile of facts.

208
00:21:21,690 --> 00:21:26,100
If you're trying to find your socks in this pile, that is going to be less efficient than if you're trying to find socks in that pile.

209
00:21:26,310 --> 00:21:32,310
Right. So the whole goal here is to try to come up with some organizational structure so that when I bombard you with a million facts or the readings,

210
00:21:32,310 --> 00:21:36,540
one by George Rubin about you, you know exactly where to put that. You're like, Oh, that sounds like an absorption thing.

211
00:21:36,630 --> 00:21:40,380
That sounds like a chemical difference in food thing or that sounds like a bioavailability thing.

212
00:21:40,560 --> 00:21:44,040
And so that's going to be consistent across all the nutrients.

213
00:21:44,370 --> 00:21:50,880
And so what I'm suggesting here is that there are going to be some consistent themes across these nutrients here.

214
00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:59,759
So what I decided to do to try to put this all in context is generate this study oops, this study guide document.

215
00:21:59,760 --> 00:22:06,000
So if you guys want to go to my PowerPoint, if you guys want to go to that link now, there should be a template.

216
00:22:06,180 --> 00:22:09,750
You should not hopefully be able to edit it. Please don't edit it if you can.

217
00:22:10,560 --> 00:22:16,350
And so what I want you to do is go to that template and just open it up so you can kind of get a sense of, of what I'm talking about here.

218
00:22:16,560 --> 00:22:21,750
And if you don't have your phone over, just talk to somebody next to you and look at a look at their screen.

219
00:22:22,890 --> 00:22:26,760
So what I tried to do is I was always going through all the nutrients and preparation for the

220
00:22:26,760 --> 00:22:31,530
semester was kind of come up with a lot of leading questions that you could ask about a nutrient,

221
00:22:31,920 --> 00:22:35,430
right. Is anybody can can anybody get on this page?

222
00:22:35,430 --> 00:22:42,360
Let's start with that. Okay. So what you can imagine is for every single lecture you can go through and try to answer all of those questions.

223
00:22:42,850 --> 00:22:51,630
That's so. So if you think of the things that you could know about nutrients, the study guide,

224
00:22:51,970 --> 00:22:57,870
this is pretty sure to think that this would be like the sum of all the knowledge that you could in order to do that.

225
00:22:58,070 --> 00:23:03,530
So in theory, you could try to answer all of those questions about every single measure.

226
00:23:03,620 --> 00:23:09,470
Now, that would probably be not super duper productive and certainly is not in the smaller sub circle of things that will be on the exam.

227
00:23:09,830 --> 00:23:15,770
Right. But as probably all you've learned at this point, I sort of think that knowing all of this stuff helps solidify this stuff in the middle.

228
00:23:15,780 --> 00:23:21,530
Right? So that's why that study got us there. So if there's something on that study guide that is not covered,

229
00:23:21,530 --> 00:23:27,590
it's either because I didn't have the time to cover it or the reading didn't cover it, or it's not important or it's not there.

230
00:23:27,800 --> 00:23:32,180
So don't panic. If you see something on there that is like, Oh, my God, there was this whole class.

231
00:23:32,180 --> 00:23:35,809
You didn't talk about how I the sense in the body or something, right?

232
00:23:35,810 --> 00:23:41,570
That might just mean it's not that important for the exam, but that doesn't mean it's not important for like understanding how that works.

233
00:23:42,170 --> 00:23:46,340
So the reason I wanted to create these study guide templates is I generally won't organize the

234
00:23:46,340 --> 00:23:50,330
lectures around going through these five things over and over that would get pretty boring,

235
00:23:51,290 --> 00:23:52,429
especially from interest me.

236
00:23:52,430 --> 00:23:59,720
If I'm bored then you're probably super bored, but that should be a good indicator being like, Oh, is there something in here about that?

237
00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:00,680
Does that make sense?

238
00:24:01,520 --> 00:24:07,520
So like I said, I don't want you to look at this and be like, Oh my God, we're going to learn all of that times 27 because we're not.

239
00:24:07,730 --> 00:24:12,240
But that should be a way to sort of organize. You know what?

240
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:15,870
A closet organize what the closet is for where things go.

241
00:24:15,920 --> 00:24:19,280
Right. So if I talk about something, that's how it is. I also think it'll be helpful for you.

242
00:24:19,290 --> 00:24:24,420
I've talked a lot of you about how you study for the exams. I think maybe almost every single one of you about how you study for the secondary exams.

243
00:24:24,690 --> 00:24:27,239
Some of you really like these sort of template type study guides, right?

244
00:24:27,240 --> 00:24:30,330
So I think that'll be useful, but you do not have to use it if you find it useless.

245
00:24:30,330 --> 00:24:32,980
Don't bother. Right. I'm just, like I said, trying to find a way that you can coordinate.

246
00:24:33,390 --> 00:24:39,030
The goal of the template is that you can just copy it, rename the nutrient to whatever calling, which will be Monday.

247
00:24:39,210 --> 00:24:41,070
And then as you're doing the readings kind of go through and be like,

248
00:24:41,070 --> 00:24:44,910
here's another place I can take note of a calling, or Here is something that I'm not sure about.

249
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:52,530
Is this important? And I'm happy to. You know, work with you either on Yellow Day or Piazza Perusal or whatever.

250
00:24:52,950 --> 00:24:55,680
In terms of like, is this covered? Did I miss this? Right?

251
00:24:56,310 --> 00:25:01,020
He was like I said, there's going to be a lot that that is going to be covered in a lot that is not okay.

252
00:25:01,020 --> 00:25:06,270
So what I want you guys to do then for the next 10 minutes or so.

253
00:25:07,800 --> 00:25:12,060
5 minutes or so is I want you to go through those and just randomly pick a question.

254
00:25:12,150 --> 00:25:15,560
All right. So, you know, I know sometimes people's eyes go to an easy question,

255
00:25:15,570 --> 00:25:20,370
but just like kind of close your eyes and randomly pick a question and see if you could answer that about a macronutrient.

256
00:25:20,520 --> 00:25:26,579
Because we talked about a lot of these things about macronutrients and this going be sort of our first great craft activity here.

257
00:25:26,580 --> 00:25:31,890
So pick one of those, pick a sentence and be like, Oh yeah, yeah. That reminds me of like fiber or whatever.

258
00:25:32,700 --> 00:25:36,029
And then think of you come to answer the question, I kind of don't really care if you're right.

259
00:25:36,030 --> 00:25:38,639
I just want you to sort of be able to kind of remember that we learned a bunch

260
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:42,060
of things about macronutrients not that long ago and that you could apply that.

261
00:25:42,060 --> 00:25:47,940
And so it'll be a sort of way to do that. What Drew, Drew and I will do is we'll take all of your individual submissions and put them all in there.

262
00:25:48,150 --> 00:25:52,650
So if it helps to have illustrating examples on the study guide, that's kind of what we do, right?

263
00:25:52,650 --> 00:25:56,850
So if you're like, Oh, I don't really know what he means by nutrient interactions, but then there's an example there.

264
00:25:56,850 --> 00:26:00,060
Then it might help crystalize what I mean by nutrient interactions.

265
00:26:00,450 --> 00:26:03,689
And because it gets really quiet in this room, I think in this case I would prefer,

266
00:26:03,690 --> 00:26:07,340
if you like, talk to the people around you as you're doing this because it's disconcerting.

267
00:26:07,350 --> 00:26:10,220
Quite. We all just want to hear. Yeah.

268
00:26:10,770 --> 00:26:15,209
And then you should be able to log on to get logged on to great contribute a new great craft account to submit it.

269
00:26:15,210 --> 00:26:18,150
And so for the new people, I will explain to you what I mean by that.

270
00:26:18,150 --> 00:26:50,560
So if you want to be heard to get an agreement, know she can start with you and then take a second idea to have a great.

271
00:26:53,440 --> 00:27:37,019
Okay, so we have become more examples of this and then you want me to do that because so far I wouldn't look at it.

272
00:27:37,020 --> 00:28:02,040
And I have to say you have to work for the stuff of the.

273
00:28:03,750 --> 00:28:44,460
Yeah. Okay. You know, the division of the conflict on the other person, reasonable person would want to.

274
00:28:49,500 --> 00:29:23,700
But I don't think when I hit against.

275
00:30:45,190 --> 00:30:54,630
Okay. Or you just.

276
00:30:56,340 --> 00:31:05,570
I didn't think I was going to.

277
00:31:19,160 --> 00:31:31,500
Oh. So it sounds like the typing is kind of dialed down a little bit.

278
00:31:32,430 --> 00:31:36,690
So if somebody want to suggest or volunteer one of their ideas or answers.

279
00:31:38,220 --> 00:31:45,080
So from African elephants. And the question says, are there other factors and three sources that affect the bioavailability of this nutrient.

280
00:31:45,090 --> 00:31:50,220
And I set up a diet very high in carbohydrates without any spare elements and started using carbohydrates for fuel.

281
00:31:51,150 --> 00:31:55,350
And is it just cooking or other types of food preparation affect the bioavailability of the nutrient?

282
00:31:55,350 --> 00:32:02,700
I said, yes. Some less stable factors that can be oxidized by high heat cooking or hydrogen generated by manufacturing processes.

283
00:32:02,790 --> 00:32:04,890
Yeah, absolutely. Those are those are really great examples.

284
00:32:05,010 --> 00:32:08,820
So one thing I put in my notes that are not showing because I couldn't get the projected word correctly,

285
00:32:09,060 --> 00:32:13,590
is that there's a couple general things are going to be different in terms of focus in this semester.

286
00:32:13,590 --> 00:32:18,240
So one thing for sure is calories a fun fact. Micronutrients in minerals do not have calories.

287
00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:25,650
So we spent a lot of time talking about calories and efficiency and calories and food and how these things are converted into energy.

288
00:32:25,650 --> 00:32:26,850
That's like not going be the case at all.

289
00:32:27,030 --> 00:32:32,970
Now, obesity has a chronic disease that affects especially the liver and kidney function is going to come up a lot,

290
00:32:33,090 --> 00:32:36,270
but we're not going to directly talk about calories as much as we did before.

291
00:32:36,510 --> 00:32:44,190
The other big difference is that the inner conversion, which Nicole indirectly alluded to here of fat,

292
00:32:44,280 --> 00:32:49,440
can become things that can become carbohydrates and carbohydrates can become fat and proteins and whatnot.

293
00:32:49,980 --> 00:32:52,620
In some circumstances, that's like not going to happen at all either, right?

294
00:32:52,620 --> 00:32:56,250
So these it doesn't matter how much iron you need, your vitamin D status is not going to help.

295
00:32:56,310 --> 00:33:00,719
Right. So these things are all more or less discrete and not interchangeable, which is a big difference from macronutrients,

296
00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:05,160
which hopefully I hammered into your heads that are like reasonably interchangeable and kind of surprising.

297
00:33:05,280 --> 00:33:12,270
They're not. Anybody else have any other ideas of things that they thought of that would fit in that guide that were related to macronutrients?

298
00:33:17,090 --> 00:33:21,340
Now the question is what are the major tissue reservoirs of this nutrient?

299
00:33:21,340 --> 00:33:26,420
And then I just chose that and we'll just talk about how that is generally starting adipose and

300
00:33:26,440 --> 00:33:31,540
how this access it can be stored within or between organs and then also stored like subcutaneous.

301
00:33:31,900 --> 00:33:33,100
Yeah. So that's a good example.

302
00:33:33,100 --> 00:33:38,170
And so almost every nutrient going to have a sort terminal and start with middle ever, not always, but almost always going to be the liver.

303
00:33:38,920 --> 00:33:42,860
And so yeah, that's very important and it also is going to be important when things spill out of the organ.

304
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:44,350
All right. So I don't make that analogy.

305
00:33:44,350 --> 00:33:51,280
A lot of lipo dystrophy being fat in the wrong place is kind of similar to say, having magnets in wrong place or having not sure.

306
00:33:51,700 --> 00:33:54,820
Good examples. Anybody else.

307
00:33:58,780 --> 00:34:00,340
I chose the one where it said,

308
00:34:00,760 --> 00:34:11,860
does this nutrient have different structural changes in the body of food carbohydrates that exist as monomeric units and they exist as polymers?

309
00:34:11,860 --> 00:34:21,990
And it can either be something that starch which is digestible or cellulose and other factors that are not digestible or have similar.

310
00:34:22,550 --> 00:34:25,510
Yeah. So a couple of things I think that's those are really good. I think.

311
00:34:26,710 --> 00:34:31,480
So certainly the ability of you to break it down into an available form is going to come up quite a lot.

312
00:34:31,480 --> 00:34:37,600
There are certain nutrients that are need to be converted by something into an absorbable form that's really rare, but it is going to come up.

313
00:34:37,600 --> 00:34:41,589
But then more so, more importantly is like the actual structure of them is going to matter a lot, right?

314
00:34:41,590 --> 00:34:45,489
Especially for the bioavailable in that matters a lot in terms of what is the kind of thing that is

315
00:34:45,490 --> 00:34:50,230
4 to 5 kind of things supplement and which form is the best for which person and things like that.

316
00:34:50,330 --> 00:34:56,770
Yes, that's good. Okay. So I have a couple of examples and these will be oops, I have one question and then a couple of examples.

317
00:34:57,010 --> 00:35:00,729
So so for the study guide, I think these are going to be useful.

318
00:35:00,730 --> 00:35:05,800
And again, since this is like a great craft based course, it's like up to you decide if you think it's useful and if you want to do it or not.

319
00:35:06,820 --> 00:35:14,230
I would like input on how to make working on the study guide somehow like worth points in some way.

320
00:35:15,820 --> 00:35:20,980
I don't know what that looks like. I spent a little bit of time over the course to break think about it, but I haven't really come up with anything.

321
00:35:21,100 --> 00:35:28,120
But if you have an idea of something of like I think that maybe we could do something collaborative or people could submit partial study guides,

322
00:35:28,120 --> 00:35:31,570
or you could work in groups to complete a study guide or complete 50% of study guide or whatever,

323
00:35:31,750 --> 00:35:36,340
and then submit that as something you get points for. I think that would be probably good.

324
00:35:36,340 --> 00:35:39,730
I don't know exactly what that would look like and I don't know.

325
00:35:40,680 --> 00:35:44,759
You guys know how you study. So what I would like to find is sort of the intersection of like what you guys would

326
00:35:44,760 --> 00:35:48,479
find useful in studying but is also useful in terms of getting you great craft points.

327
00:35:48,480 --> 00:35:51,000
So your points are in line with the study. So,

328
00:35:51,480 --> 00:35:55,140
so if you have ideas and I would like you to have ideas because you get some better ideas and you usually

329
00:35:55,860 --> 00:36:00,370
post that at some point after class on yellow dick and you'll be able to see every else's things too.

330
00:36:00,390 --> 00:36:04,170
So if you just think, Oh yeah, that also is a good idea. I agree with that. Then we'll talk about that next class.

331
00:36:04,170 --> 00:36:08,040
Right? So I'd like I said I'd like to make some sort of great craft assignment if you guys are going to put effort into this,

332
00:36:08,040 --> 00:36:12,149
if you choose to put effort into into this elective activity. Okay.

333
00:36:12,150 --> 00:36:16,320
So I have three or four examples. I can see what slide I have ahead of me.

334
00:36:16,530 --> 00:36:22,800
So first one, pretty obvious. The nutrients have a pile of coral that in about overall we wouldn't notice if it wasn't working.

335
00:36:23,280 --> 00:36:30,569
So this is iron. Here it is. You can see iron, as many of you hopefully know, is important for carrying oxygen around as part of the Heme group,

336
00:36:30,570 --> 00:36:33,840
which is about in turn to hemoglobin, which is in turn in a red blood cell.

337
00:36:33,840 --> 00:36:39,659
Right. So by sort of the multiple transitive property, you can imagine a scenario that if you're doing a lot of aerobic exercise,

338
00:36:39,660 --> 00:36:42,870
being anemic or having more iron or low hemoglobin is not going to be helpful.

339
00:36:42,970 --> 00:36:46,080
Right. So that's how it's about all is related to its carrying of iron.

340
00:36:46,080 --> 00:36:51,870
Of course, that's not the only thing that the iron does. Now, another example is what are the main forces?

341
00:36:51,870 --> 00:36:59,060
Is there evidence of deficiencies or excesses? So in this case here, I'm showing you the prevalence of anemia worldwide.

342
00:36:59,070 --> 00:37:03,690
So anemia is pretty common in the U.S. relative to some of the other diseases we talked about.

343
00:37:03,690 --> 00:37:09,450
Somewhere between five and 10% of people in the U.S. have anemia.

344
00:37:09,450 --> 00:37:11,670
But you can see globally the problems is much, much higher.

345
00:37:11,700 --> 00:37:16,319
So, for example, in India and some places in sub-Saharan Africa, the prevalence of anemia as like 40 to 45%.

346
00:37:16,320 --> 00:37:21,870
Right. So it's a really, really major public health concern. Right. And so why is that the case in?

347
00:37:22,200 --> 00:37:26,070
There's different reasons for the different rationales for the anemia.

348
00:37:26,460 --> 00:37:32,010
Also, this goes into the question of like, are they fortifying foods with sufficient are they fortifying the right foods

349
00:37:32,160 --> 00:37:35,490
with the right kind of iron at the right rates in all of these countries?

350
00:37:35,500 --> 00:37:40,770
And that's we'll talk about that when we get to the folate lecture into how to look at global food fortification programs.

351
00:37:41,040 --> 00:37:43,610
But obviously, if you're not consuming iron, you're not getting it.

352
00:37:43,620 --> 00:37:48,420
Eventually you're going run out of iron and eventually you're going to develop at least iron deficiency anemia.

353
00:37:49,620 --> 00:37:54,000
I didn't mean to make all of these about iron. It just happened to be the first three that I came up with were.

354
00:37:54,570 --> 00:37:58,110
So this is to Jinnah's point about the relative importance of structure.

355
00:37:58,260 --> 00:38:04,940
So iron exists in our food in sort of three different forms. There's iron that is bound to him, usually in the form of meat.

356
00:38:05,610 --> 00:38:10,830
There's also just free iron and free iron either in the ferric or the ferrous form.

357
00:38:10,980 --> 00:38:15,330
And that really dramatically impacts the bioavailability. And the reason for that, as we'll talk about in the Iron Unit,

358
00:38:15,540 --> 00:38:20,310
is that there's a specific heme transporter that allows for to absorb heme really effectively.

359
00:38:20,460 --> 00:38:24,210
So if you're not eating heme bound iron and for many people or regions or vegetarians,

360
00:38:24,210 --> 00:38:28,230
they are not they have to be aware that the bioavailability of the iron they're consuming is much, much lower.

361
00:38:28,260 --> 00:38:33,630
Right, because it's absorbed much less effectively. And that's because of the differences in in their structure.

362
00:38:35,010 --> 00:38:41,940
How does that happen? How do we know if we absorb or not very often, but not restate that there is often regulation of transport?

363
00:38:42,060 --> 00:38:46,350
My bias is there is always regulation of transport. We just don't always know what it is.

364
00:38:47,190 --> 00:38:50,850
And so this is a pretty canonical example of vitamin D affecting calcium transport.

365
00:38:51,360 --> 00:38:56,969
Vitamin D gets converted into this complicated 1.25 hydroxy vitamin D, which is the active form.

366
00:38:56,970 --> 00:38:58,590
It activates the vitamin D receptor,

367
00:38:59,100 --> 00:39:04,499
and then that causes an increase in calcium transporters to increase the bioavailability of calcium from the blood.

368
00:39:04,500 --> 00:39:07,530
Begin to talk about this a lot and we get very low in calcium.

369
00:39:07,530 --> 00:39:12,839
But what that means is that the production of this active form of vitamin D is dependent on sensing of calcium.

370
00:39:12,840 --> 00:39:18,059
So if you need calcium, you actually more vitamin D, you're actually more vitamin D, you are able to absorb more calcium.

371
00:39:18,060 --> 00:39:24,690
So this is an example. We know all the pieces, most of the pieces that were exposed here in how this happens.

372
00:39:24,690 --> 00:39:26,999
But we do not know this for all of them.

373
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:32,430
So, for example, for folate, we know folate absorption is higher when you're on a reduced folate diet or if you were on well,

374
00:39:32,760 --> 00:39:38,459
we have no idea how that happens. We're actually 900% sure that it's due to activation of the receptors.

375
00:39:38,460 --> 00:39:45,960
Right. So that's regulation of transport. And then the last example I have is this idea of nutrient interactions, which also happens to be about iron.

376
00:39:46,020 --> 00:39:50,400
So as I said, iron, non iron is in two different forms, a three plus and a two plus form.

377
00:39:50,880 --> 00:39:59,040
You can convert the three plus to the two plus form if you have this due to cytochrome b here it turns out cycle B also requires vitamin C.

378
00:39:59,340 --> 00:40:03,690
So that is a cofactor for this enzyme, which means that if you have insufficient amounts of vitamin C,

379
00:40:03,690 --> 00:40:11,580
you are unable to turn vitamin or turn iron into its bioavailable form, a slightly more bioavailable form about three times more bioavailable.

380
00:40:11,790 --> 00:40:17,579
And this is shown by like an old study from 1970 is that if you just give people ferric iron supplements with or without orange juice,

381
00:40:17,580 --> 00:40:21,719
they get much more iron absorption if they have orange juice. So that's what I mean by nutrient interactions.

382
00:40:21,720 --> 00:40:25,350
And so this can happen with macronutrients or it can happen with micronutrients and it happens a lot.

383
00:40:25,590 --> 00:40:29,770
A lot of these things are either working together or working in antagonism to each other, right?

384
00:40:29,790 --> 00:40:33,150
So if you have too much of two nutrients, they compete for the same transporter sometimes.

385
00:40:33,330 --> 00:40:38,100
Sometimes two nutrients work together, in this case, vitamin C and iron. Working together to synergize the absorption.

386
00:40:38,220 --> 00:40:43,180
You can also make the same argument. Hear about having enough vitamin D allowing you to have calcium.

387
00:40:43,180 --> 00:40:46,940
So it'll be another example of a nutrient interaction here. Okay.

388
00:40:46,990 --> 00:40:52,090
And then the last example, again, General mentioned this is sort of the variety of structures.

389
00:40:52,330 --> 00:40:58,930
So I mentioned vitamin B6 really briefly in passing. It's a trans mini supporting thing for all of you to remember what trans Americans are.

390
00:40:59,710 --> 00:41:08,080
And so it turns out when you eat vitamin B6, one B6 comes in at least six different forms that are sort of structurally different.

391
00:41:08,380 --> 00:41:14,560
These are the only ones that are bioavailable. So we call these vitamins. And so these are the ones that we can absorb, but they're not functional.

392
00:41:14,590 --> 00:41:17,410
This is the one that's functional. Right. So there has to be some metabolism.

393
00:41:17,590 --> 00:41:21,850
And again, there'll be a whole lecture about vitamin B6 of like, how do we figure out how to absorb these?

394
00:41:21,850 --> 00:41:27,579
And then how do we regulate the conversion of the precursor vitamins into the active pyridoxine phosphate,

395
00:41:27,580 --> 00:41:31,580
which goes on in as a cofactor in this case for trans lemonades and a bunch of other things.

396
00:41:31,640 --> 00:41:36,990
Right. So there's a lot of metabolism of these nutrients. Now there's less than four macronutrients, right?

397
00:41:37,010 --> 00:41:41,590
Like there was these long, complicated pathways by which alanine could become glutamate or something like that.

398
00:41:41,770 --> 00:41:45,490
There's less of that, but there's still quite a bit. Right. And it's important that we sort of know all these structures.

399
00:41:45,700 --> 00:41:52,150
And remember, if we're eating food, if you imagine if you're a carnivore and you're eating food, I have all of these in my body.

400
00:41:52,270 --> 00:41:57,879
So if somebody was eating meat that looks sort of like the biochemical composition of me, then they would absorb all of these, right?

401
00:41:57,880 --> 00:42:02,530
Or they could theoretically, but they only have access to some of them and some of them aren't even the ones that are useful.

402
00:42:02,740 --> 00:42:08,740
So there has to be some conversion, and you'll probably not be surprised to hear that various people have various genetic deficiencies

403
00:42:08,740 --> 00:42:12,030
and various parts of these steps and that all affect their level of requirement for this.

404
00:42:12,340 --> 00:42:16,180
That'll be a lot of the examples that we go through, go through in class.

405
00:42:16,780 --> 00:42:20,079
Okay. So that is all I have for you guys for today, for this whole week.

406
00:42:20,080 --> 00:42:24,040
But I'm already done teaching for a week. This amazing one down, it came to go.

407
00:42:24,910 --> 00:42:28,360
So next week we're going to start with Colleen and Full eight.

408
00:42:28,360 --> 00:42:32,070
So the readings and the quizzes are already posted. Same thing.

409
00:42:32,080 --> 00:42:40,659
Take a look up perusal beforehand. Hopefully you can get access to all the various electronic learning tools that we're using.

410
00:42:40,660 --> 00:42:43,020
If you are stuck or whatever, then let me know.

411
00:42:43,120 --> 00:42:47,920
And like I said, if you're the two people who didn't take 630, you can just hang out for a couple of minutes.

412
00:42:48,130 --> 00:42:51,150
So it'll be like at least 20 minutes until I am left for the day itself.

413
00:42:51,240 --> 00:42:59,370
So if you want to go get a copy, you're more than welcome to, but I'll unlock it at some point, 1230 ish, and I'll see you guys all on Monday at 11.
