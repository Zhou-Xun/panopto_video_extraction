1
00:00:04,954 --> 00:00:09,954
the cohort study design as used in epidemiology. Before we do that, we will

2
00:00:09,954 --> 00:00:14,954
review the classes of epidemiological study designs that were introduced in the very first session to

3
00:00:14,954 --> 00:00:20,954
this class. Recall that there are two main classes of study designs

4
00:00:20,954 --> 00:00:25,954
in epidemiology, observational studies, which includes cohort case control, cross-sectional

5
00:00:25,954 --> 00:00:30,954
and ecological studies and experimental studies, which includes intervention trials

6
00:00:30,954 --> 00:00:35,954
or and randomized controlled trials or RC teams. We will go over each of

7
00:00:35,954 --> 00:00:40,954
these five different study designs in the upcoming sessions, beginning with cohort studies

8
00:00:40,954 --> 00:00:45,954
today. In a cohort study, we ascertain exposure,

9
00:00:45,954 --> 00:00:51,954
status of the individuals in the study. And then we follow them forward over time to

10
00:00:51,954 --> 00:00:56,954
assess the outcome. Cohort studies are also referred to as longitudinal studies

11
00:00:56,954 --> 00:01:02,954
or follow up studies. You may also see them referred to as panel studies in the economics literature.

12
00:01:02,954 --> 00:01:07,954
So an example would be imagine that you are the investigator. This little stick figure at the bottom

13
00:01:07,954 --> 00:01:12,954
of the slide and this diagram shows the temporal ordering of time as it occurs in

14
00:01:12,954 --> 00:01:18,954
a cohort city. So you would conduct your study beginning now. In the present time,

15
00:01:18,954 --> 00:01:23,954
you would enroll your cohort and you would define people in the cohort who are exposed to exposure X

16
00:01:23,954 --> 00:01:28,954
and the group of people who are not exposed to X given a binary exposure. That is either

17
00:01:28,954 --> 00:01:34,954
present or not present. We would then follow the cohort forward as calendar

18
00:01:34,954 --> 00:01:39,954
time naturally unfolds and we would look to see who gets disease Y among those

19
00:01:39,954 --> 00:01:44,954
who were and were not exposed. And this is considered to be a strong design

20
00:01:44,954 --> 00:01:49,954
to establish temporality, which is where the exposure precedes the outcome.

21
00:01:49,954 --> 00:01:55,954
Recall that Temporality was one of the Bradford Hill viewpoints, and it is considered to be very important

22
00:01:55,954 --> 00:02:00,954
for causal inference. In contrast, in a case control

23
00:02:00,954 --> 00:02:05,954
study, we select people on the basis of their outcome. And we defined this

24
00:02:05,954 --> 00:02:11,954
group as the cases and comparable people who do not have the outcome or controls.

25
00:02:11,954 --> 00:02:17,954
So imagine that you, the investigator, are the little stick figure again at the bottom of the slide

26
00:02:17,954 --> 00:02:22,954
and you conduct your study. Now, in present calendar time, we would actually recruit

27
00:02:22,954 --> 00:02:27,954
people on the basis of their disease or outcome status. So you would identify a group of

28
00:02:27,954 --> 00:02:33,954
people with the outcome or disease y and a comparable group of people without the outcome

29
00:02:33,954 --> 00:02:38,954
or disease y. And then we would go back in time to compare the exposure

30
00:02:38,954 --> 00:02:44,954
histories of people with and without the disease. And we can get these data from a variety of sources,

31
00:02:44,954 --> 00:02:49,954
such as historical employment records, medical records, residential histories or self reported histories

32
00:02:49,954 --> 00:02:54,954
of lifestyle factors, etc. We will go over case control studies in more depth

33
00:02:54,954 --> 00:03:00,954
in some of the upcoming sessions. And finally, cross-sectional studies.

34
00:03:00,954 --> 00:03:05,954
In a cross-sectional study, we assess the exposure and the outcome at the same point in time.

35
00:03:05,954 --> 00:03:10,954
So a survey would be across sexual study or if we were to take data from the baseline

36
00:03:10,954 --> 00:03:17,954
or starting point of a cohort study and analyze it. This would be a cross-sectional design.

37
00:03:17,954 --> 00:03:23,954
Usually in a cross-sectional study, we cannot establish temporality between the exposure and the outcome.

38
00:03:23,954 --> 00:03:29,954
And this is why across sexual study is considered to be the weakest design for causal inference.

39
00:03:29,954 --> 00:03:34,954
So let's move on to cohort studies and a little bit more death. So the first

40
00:03:34,954 --> 00:03:39,954
question is, how do we define a cohort for a study? So I introduced

41
00:03:39,954 --> 00:03:44,954
to you earlier the idea that we define individuals in a cohort study on the basis

42
00:03:44,954 --> 00:03:49,954
of their exposure status. So we can certainly recruit people into a cohort study on

43
00:03:49,954 --> 00:03:56,954
the basis of them being exposed and then find a comparable group of people who are not exposed.

44
00:03:56,954 --> 00:04:01,954
But there are other ways we can define a cohort which is usually based on membership to a meaningful

45
00:04:01,954 --> 00:04:06,954
social group. So one example is by year of birth. So the

46
00:04:06,954 --> 00:04:12,954
1946 British Birth Cohort Study or the Millennium Birth Cohort Study are good examples

47
00:04:12,954 --> 00:04:17,954
of birth cohort studies. And these are real, true cohorts because they enroll people

48
00:04:17,954 --> 00:04:22,954
born in a given year and then they follow them forward over time to assess a range of different health

49
00:04:22,954 --> 00:04:27,954
outcomes. Many cohort studies are also defined according to occupational

50
00:04:27,954 --> 00:04:33,954
groups. So one famous example is the US nurse at US Nurses Health Study,

51
00:04:33,954 --> 00:04:38,954
which has provided a wealth of information on women's health and chronic disease.

52
00:04:38,954 --> 00:04:43,954
Another well-known example are the Whitehall studies, which were conducted among government

53
00:04:43,954 --> 00:04:48,954
workers in Whitehall, London and the first Whitehall study was one of the first studies that

54
00:04:48,954 --> 00:04:53,954
demonstrated socio economic gradients and cardiovascular disease outcomes.

55
00:04:53,954 --> 00:04:58,954
And finally, another common way that cohorts are defined in studies are by geography.

56
00:04:58,954 --> 00:05:04,954
So the U.S. Health and Retirement Study is a nationally representative cohort study of U.S. adults

57
00:05:04,954 --> 00:05:09,954
aged 50 and over. Another important example is the Framingham Heart Study,

58
00:05:09,954 --> 00:05:14,954
which has provided much of the essential and foundational data that we have

59
00:05:14,954 --> 00:05:20,954
on a range of cardiovascular health outcomes. And the Framingham Heart Study was defined

60
00:05:20,954 --> 00:05:27,954
by its sampling frame of residents of the town of Framingham in Massachusetts.

61
00:05:27,954 --> 00:05:32,954
The next question is, where do we get data from in cohort studies? So once we've defined our cohort, there

62
00:05:32,954 --> 00:05:37,954
are a variety of ways to get data. One is through routine administrative records such as

63
00:05:37,954 --> 00:05:43,954
vital records, medical records, disease registries or occupational records. Another

64
00:05:43,954 --> 00:05:48,954
primary method of collecting data in cohort studies comes from surveys or interviews. And

65
00:05:48,954 --> 00:05:53,954
these can be conducted through a variety of ways, such as in-person interviews, telephone

66
00:05:53,954 --> 00:05:58,954
interviews, mail in surveys or online surveys. And then finally, direct measurements

67
00:05:58,954 --> 00:06:07,954
such as blood draws taken to assess biomarkers or measures of blood pressure or height.

68
00:06:07,954 --> 00:06:12,954
One of the primary strengths of cohort studies are their ability to establish the temporality of

69
00:06:12,954 --> 00:06:17,954
an exposure being measured before the disease outcome. And this happens because the exposure status is

70
00:06:17,954 --> 00:06:22,954
always measured before the disease outcome occurs. And this has a few other benefits

71
00:06:22,954 --> 00:06:27,954
as well. With respect to reducing error and bias in our studies. So first, the

72
00:06:27,954 --> 00:06:33,954
disease status does not influence the amount of error with which the exposure was measured because the disease

73
00:06:33,954 --> 00:06:38,954
has not happened at that point in which we measure the exposure. And similarly, the disease

74
00:06:38,954 --> 00:06:43,954
status does not generally influence the likelihood that someone is selected into the study.

75
00:06:43,954 --> 00:06:48,954
If this did happen, it would be a form of selection bias. And we will talk about this later on in the course.

76
00:06:48,954 --> 00:06:54,954
Another key strength, of course, studies is that they can be used to study multiple outcomes and exposure.

77
00:06:54,954 --> 00:06:59,954
So they can give us really a wealth of data. This is also useful when exposures change

78
00:06:59,954 --> 00:07:04,954
in value over time. And we want to capture that. So, for example, people often quit smoking

79
00:07:04,954 --> 00:07:10,954
and we would want to capture that change in exposure status over time. In a study of smoking and

80
00:07:10,954 --> 00:07:15,954
a certain health outcome. We can also use cohort studies to investigate

81
00:07:15,954 --> 00:07:20,954
rare exposures so we can select people for the study based on their exposure status. And

82
00:07:20,954 --> 00:07:25,954
we will get into that in more depth later on in this session. Cohort

83
00:07:25,954 --> 00:07:31,954
studies can be prospective retrospective or and be directional.

84
00:07:31,954 --> 00:07:36,954
The first and probably the most common type of cohort city that you will see is the classic

85
00:07:36,954 --> 00:07:42,954
prospective study. So the investigator begins the study and selects our participant

86
00:07:42,954 --> 00:07:47,954
participants. And study follow up. Goes forward in calendar time.

87
00:07:47,954 --> 00:07:52,954
And it is called in other terms, a concurrent study, because the follow up period

88
00:07:52,954 --> 00:07:57,954
of this study naturally matches with calendar time. The second

89
00:07:57,954 --> 00:08:03,954
type of court study is a retrospective study. And so the investigator would begin the study

90
00:08:03,954 --> 00:08:08,954
actually after follow up has ended. But what the investigator would do would go be

91
00:08:08,954 --> 00:08:14,954
to go back in time, select people and define them into exposure categories

92
00:08:14,954 --> 00:08:20,954
and then follow them forward for outcomes. So, for example, many occupational cohorts

93
00:08:20,954 --> 00:08:25,954
are retrospective studies. So, for example, we may go back and get employment records

94
00:08:25,954 --> 00:08:30,954
from, say, 30 years ago and then categorize people into exposure groups based on their

95
00:08:30,954 --> 00:08:35,954
employment records that happened 30 years ago and then follow them forward to present time to

96
00:08:35,954 --> 00:08:40,954
look at outcomes. And an bidirectional study is a blend of a prospective and retrospective

97
00:08:40,954 --> 00:08:46,954
study. We may use historical data to gain information about some exposures, but we are still following

98
00:08:46,954 --> 00:08:52,954
people up actively into calendar time going forward.

99
00:08:52,954 --> 00:08:57,954
And I can also recognize here that it may be confusing right now to distinguish between a retrospective cohort

100
00:08:57,954 --> 00:09:02,954
study and a case control study, because both use historical data and go back in time

101
00:09:02,954 --> 00:09:07,954
in order to clarify things. I would say that a constant attribute of cohort studies is that

102
00:09:07,954 --> 00:09:13,954
participants are selected into the study on the basis of belonging to a meaningful cohort.

103
00:09:13,954 --> 00:09:18,954
So whether that is defined by something like year of birth, geography or occupational class

104
00:09:18,954 --> 00:09:23,954
or on the basis of their exposure. And this distinguishes retrospective cohort studies

105
00:09:23,954 --> 00:09:28,954
from the case control design, where participants are always selected into the study on the basis of

106
00:09:28,954 --> 00:09:33,954
their outcome rather than exposure. Hopefully this will become more clear later on

107
00:09:33,954 --> 00:09:39,954
when we learn more about case control studies. And some issues to consider when determining

108
00:09:39,954 --> 00:09:44,954
the type of cohort study to conduct include what is your research question? What is the most appropriate design?

109
00:09:44,954 --> 00:09:49,954
How much time and money do we have? And do we actually have the study population that we need

110
00:09:49,954 --> 00:09:55,954
to answer the question available, as well as the type of data that we need available?

111
00:09:55,954 --> 00:10:00,954
So let's briefly run through some advantages and disadvantages of each type of car study.

112
00:10:00,954 --> 00:10:05,954
So in a prospective cohort study, we can design the study measures and methods of follow up specifically

113
00:10:05,954 --> 00:10:10,954
to suit our research question. So there's a lot of flexibility involved, but a disadvantage

114
00:10:10,954 --> 00:10:15,954
of a prospective court study, which you may have figured out as we've talked

115
00:10:15,954 --> 00:10:20,954
about this. It may take a long time to follow up, to observe incident cases, and this

116
00:10:20,954 --> 00:10:27,954
means that prospective court studies can be very expensive because they take a lot of resources.

117
00:10:27,954 --> 00:10:32,954
A retrospective cohort is less expensive than a prospective cohort and less time intensive

118
00:10:32,954 --> 00:10:37,954
because the follow up time has already elapsed in history. We just need to go back and get the records.

119
00:10:37,954 --> 00:10:42,954
But this also means that we need to rely on available information. So if we're using historical record

120
00:10:42,954 --> 00:10:47,954
data, they may be less than ideal quality with respect to the exposure and outcome that we're interested

121
00:10:47,954 --> 00:10:53,954
in. One other really important point with cohort studies

122
00:10:53,954 --> 00:10:59,954
is that a dynamic population can be artificially transformed into a fixed cohort.

123
00:10:59,954 --> 00:11:04,954
If all of information is available on each cohort member. So recall earlier on

124
00:11:04,954 --> 00:11:09,954
in the course, we learned about open populations as dynamic populations where people can

125
00:11:09,954 --> 00:11:14,954
enter and withdraw at different points in calendar time. One thing we could do then

126
00:11:14,954 --> 00:11:20,954
is we could align calendar time according to the time of entry into the population

127
00:11:20,954 --> 00:11:25,954
or cohort and assign that to be time zero and then follow people up based on

128
00:11:25,954 --> 00:11:30,954
that time in the study. Here, this is called a fixed cohort. I also personally think about it

129
00:11:30,954 --> 00:11:35,954
as a synthetic cohort because we are synthetically aligning time according to follow

130
00:11:35,954 --> 00:11:40,954
up time rather than natural calendar time. There are certain situations in which we would

131
00:11:40,954 --> 00:11:45,954
want to do this. So, for example, if we have a an ongoing cohort study that is elapsing

132
00:11:45,954 --> 00:11:51,954
in calendar time, but we want to look, let's say, compare different health outcomes

133
00:11:51,954 --> 00:11:56,954
and cancer survivors, non's versus non survivors, we may actually take all individuals

134
00:11:56,954 --> 00:12:01,954
who develop cancer in this cohort and then define the time of diagnosis

135
00:12:01,954 --> 00:12:06,954
of their cancer as time zero, regardless of when the cancer diagnosis happened

136
00:12:06,954 --> 00:12:12,954
in calendar time, and then follow them up from their. And finally,

137
00:12:12,954 --> 00:12:17,954
the slide shows a diagram of a hypothetical cohort. And I think this is a really important and useful

138
00:12:17,954 --> 00:12:22,954
diagram to keep in mind. And because we follow cohorts up over time,

139
00:12:22,954 --> 00:12:28,954
they naturally reduce in size over time because people drop out of the cohort

140
00:12:28,954 --> 00:12:33,954
or they die. So in this example, we start with an initial cohort of 1000 people. And

141
00:12:33,954 --> 00:12:38,954
the arrows indicate drop out from the cohort, which could be due to the person

142
00:12:38,954 --> 00:12:43,954
no longer being interested in taking part or dying over the follow up period. And at the end,

143
00:12:43,954 --> 00:12:48,954
we have nine hundred and eighty nine individuals involved. And this is a key limitation

144
00:12:48,954 --> 00:12:54,954
of cohort studies. And this type of dropout can result in selective pruning of the cohort,

145
00:12:54,954 --> 00:12:59,954
which can lead to bias. If the reasons for drop out are correlated with the exposure and

146
00:12:59,954 --> 00:13:04,954
outcome under study, we will discuss this later in the session. And finally,

147
00:13:04,954 --> 00:13:09,954
if we have the time and money to conduct a cohort study, they can provide valuable epidemiological evidence

148
00:13:09,954 --> 00:13:15,954
on the causes of disease and are typically considered the strongest observational epidemiological

149
00:13:15,954 --> 00:13:20,954
designed for a causal inference. And that's the end of part one.

150
00:13:20,954 --> 00:13:24,802
The next is part two, which focuses on exposures and measures in cohort studies.
