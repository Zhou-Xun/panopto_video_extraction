1
00:00:08,590 --> 00:00:13,280
Okay. Morning, everyone.

2
00:00:19,130 --> 00:00:35,720
So last time we started with some examples of convolution in the end, the start of the major topic after that, and that was the convergence.

3
00:00:35,930 --> 00:00:38,960
So we're continuing with it.

4
00:00:40,220 --> 00:00:43,580
Now last time we just defined convergence.

5
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:54,300
Um, so there's more modes that we considered, but basically looking at two of them that are most important in statistics.

6
00:00:54,920 --> 00:01:05,380
And this is convergence and probability. That was.

7
00:01:14,310 --> 00:01:26,490
That was defined as the probability of deviations of the members of the sequence from the limit.

8
00:01:27,970 --> 00:01:33,970
Um, greater than epsilon. For any given epsilon, this is supposed to go to zero.

9
00:01:38,210 --> 00:01:46,760
This is for any absolute greater than zero. And then we defined almost true convergence.

10
00:01:54,750 --> 00:02:01,860
And if there is no further context, we understand the straw is with respect to that measure.

11
00:02:11,820 --> 00:02:15,150
Or any absolutely continuous.

12
00:02:22,860 --> 00:02:30,880
Probability measure. With respect to that.

13
00:02:35,370 --> 00:02:45,240
I remember what that means. That means that any sense of zero probability according to the bag measures at some

14
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:53,310
zero lengths also give zero to the absolutely continuous probability measure.

15
00:02:55,020 --> 00:03:00,890
And this property. Um, and we also showed, uh,

16
00:03:01,550 --> 00:03:13,070
kind of extended the general fact that absolutely continuous random variables are the ones that have a PDF almost surely almost everywhere.

17
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:29,690
And. And so we defined the almost sure convergence, uh, in that was, um.

18
00:03:31,870 --> 00:03:38,560
We considered the several definitions based on our understanding of limits.

19
00:03:41,530 --> 00:03:47,020
And so this was the probability that it's those two acts.

20
00:03:47,590 --> 00:03:51,580
This time, it's just a calculus thing.

21
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:57,020
So this thing in brackets. He's.

22
00:03:58,330 --> 00:04:13,000
So it's funny, the those two acts of the right wing, they get this fixed and we are looking at all of this such that this is happening.

23
00:04:14,830 --> 00:04:21,190
And the probability of it is one which means that the convergence is not happening.

24
00:04:22,710 --> 00:04:26,250
Uh, that's possible, but only for sense of measure zero.

25
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:34,580
Okay. And we consider the bunch of equivalent definitions.

26
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:42,080
For convergence and for mobility, as well as a true convergence.

27
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:55,550
We also got a sense of convergence and probability being weaker than almost true convergence in the sense that,

28
00:04:56,360 --> 00:05:08,030
well, that was the last time, simply an intuitive consideration when we expressed more as so of probability.

29
00:05:08,030 --> 00:05:15,860
And another one that convergence and probability is limb, slope of probability being zero,

30
00:05:16,220 --> 00:05:22,040
and sometimes almost true, a convergence is a probability of soup.

31
00:05:22,350 --> 00:05:25,670
So that's intuitively a stronger statement.

32
00:05:26,300 --> 00:05:32,420
Uh, consider the bunch of definitions of. And.

33
00:05:41,780 --> 00:05:53,410
And that was it. It's okay. So because we have this lecture basically continuous.

34
00:05:54,960 --> 00:06:01,830
To build on the legend. So once we defined it, we want to study some relationships between the two.

35
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:10,800
We want to follow up on that intuition, that convergence and probability is a weaker type of convergence of random variables.

36
00:06:11,460 --> 00:06:14,760
And then we'll.

37
00:06:16,940 --> 00:06:23,480
And as usually is the case for a weaker convergence with some additional conditions,

38
00:06:24,020 --> 00:06:31,610
we can actually imply convergence in probability, almost surely from convergence and probability.

39
00:06:31,640 --> 00:06:36,200
With some additional conditions, we'll see. One example of such condition.

40
00:06:37,950 --> 00:06:49,460
Um. Okay. But before we go there, because most of the proofs have an element of contradiction to them.

41
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:55,940
So it makes sense to do some complement statements, as I call them.

42
00:07:10,330 --> 00:07:19,210
So and we'll start with what does it mean that x m does not converge to exit from village?

43
00:07:29,640 --> 00:07:36,760
Me. The options and the probabilities.

44
00:07:39,080 --> 00:07:58,550
What happened? And then I'm basically taking the a bunch of equivalent definitions that we can see in the previous lecture and then inverting them.

45
00:07:59,060 --> 00:08:07,220
So the Epsilon Delta, uh, so we had in the definition for any Epsilon Delta and if we want to complement the statement,

46
00:08:07,230 --> 00:08:11,809
so that's being flipped instead of for any epsilon delta greater than zero.

47
00:08:11,810 --> 00:08:21,830
I'm saying there exists uh, at least one epsilon, then delta a greater than zero such that.

48
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:31,790
So there we had uh, there exists some and such that for some numbers after and now I'm flipping it.

49
00:08:31,970 --> 00:08:37,580
So that's for any M I can find in one.

50
00:08:38,900 --> 00:08:42,320
So we have previously for all and one grades on them.

51
00:08:42,390 --> 00:08:49,820
Uh uh. And. Uh, Greater Eagle and.

52
00:08:51,330 --> 00:09:05,100
Such that my convergence in probabilities is not taking place, which means that x and one minus x greater epsilon.

53
00:09:05,100 --> 00:09:10,500
So this probability is not good to zero. So it's separated from zero by a delta.

54
00:09:20,230 --> 00:09:24,129
Okay. So again, a reminder of the notation.

55
00:09:24,130 --> 00:09:31,290
This is for any. This is there exists.

56
00:09:37,930 --> 00:09:42,090
There exist. Okay. So now.

57
00:09:44,040 --> 00:09:45,960
So if I'm looking at this destination,

58
00:09:46,830 --> 00:09:57,480
so I see that so I can find numbers epsilon delta greater than zero such that this probability will be a separated, uh, uh.

59
00:09:58,170 --> 00:10:04,190
And for a am I can find the member of that sequence where this is happening.

60
00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:14,540
Uh huh. Right. And, uh. Yeah, I can.

61
00:10:15,590 --> 00:10:24,790
So when we're talking about the sequence, so this is essentially a calculus sequence of probabilities of deviations that we're talking about in

62
00:10:24,950 --> 00:10:30,589
the convergence of a sequence is basically equivalent to convergence of some tail of that sequence.

63
00:10:30,590 --> 00:10:39,380
Right? So if I cut some initial part of it, uh, the same definitions applied to the tail of the sequence.

64
00:10:40,310 --> 00:10:53,360
And what that means is that, uh, so if I now cut into m one, um, I can take an equals in one.

65
00:10:55,020 --> 00:11:08,599
And then I'll. I'll find that I can find a number in the remaining tale of the sequence, let's say.

66
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:15,560
And two grades are equal and one such that and then the same thing.

67
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:34,140
Right here. And then I'll take again in equals and two, and then I can find in three grades equal into such that.

68
00:11:35,160 --> 00:11:40,380
So the previous definition is going to be valid for the table and so on.

69
00:11:40,860 --> 00:11:45,420
What it means is that there exists.

70
00:11:49,320 --> 00:12:00,730
The subsequent. It's in key such that.

71
00:12:02,270 --> 00:12:08,750
The probability is in case more in the sticks.

72
00:12:09,410 --> 00:12:13,580
Greater Epsilon will be separated from zero.

73
00:12:14,420 --> 00:12:16,970
Uh, for all members of that sub sequence.

74
00:12:20,060 --> 00:12:31,459
So if you kind of look back to calculus, so there was the epsilon delta language, the disk defined limits the name.

75
00:12:31,460 --> 00:12:37,100
So way to define limits and also the sub sequence and the self sequence thing

76
00:12:37,280 --> 00:12:42,830
was that so limit exists if and only if all sub sequences have the same limit.

77
00:12:43,950 --> 00:12:50,760
Right. So the complement of that is that there exists some sequence that doesn't have the limits and.

78
00:12:53,490 --> 00:12:58,410
So this is a pretty useful tool, as we will see later.

79
00:13:00,140 --> 00:13:13,580
Um, then so piling up on the subsequent idea there exists and basically interpreting the previous one in a somewhat different way.

80
00:13:14,120 --> 00:13:20,659
There exists a sub sequence. Uh, so the index here is key.

81
00:13:20,660 --> 00:13:26,050
Very two. One, two, three. So one. Such that.

82
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:31,670
Limited. Superior is key.

83
00:13:31,740 --> 00:13:39,420
Goes to infinity. Probability of a deviation for all members of that sub sequence.

84
00:13:44,680 --> 00:13:58,209
So instead of zero, it's larger than zero. Or so.

85
00:13:58,210 --> 00:14:04,810
We couldn't have said that. Uh, for the original sequence as well.

86
00:14:05,860 --> 00:14:13,300
So the simple argument instead of Kay can do and go into infinity.

87
00:14:15,050 --> 00:14:24,430
Probability X and minus x greater than epsilon is going to be greater than zero instead of equal to zero.

88
00:14:26,830 --> 00:14:30,070
Okay. So that was a convergence in probability.

89
00:14:31,480 --> 00:14:37,990
So here we apply calculus tools to probabilities, essentially because they are numbers.

90
00:14:38,890 --> 00:14:44,840
Now. Let's look and see how we can formulate that.

91
00:14:44,840 --> 00:14:48,980
Excel does not converge almost truly to X.

92
00:14:53,140 --> 00:14:56,379
So this was not an emergent probability.

93
00:14:56,380 --> 00:15:02,100
Do x. This is now does not converge almost truly acts.

94
00:15:02,620 --> 00:15:07,690
So here how we calculate sequence of numbers values of x.

95
00:15:09,640 --> 00:15:19,450
Of exams for a fixed on the right and there are strings attached as to what I guess when the convergence takes place.

96
00:15:22,680 --> 00:15:26,910
Some trivial, uh, counting and statements.

97
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:33,959
So the probability that exam goes to X again, this event is interpreted as all lawmakers.

98
00:15:33,960 --> 00:15:40,540
Where. That's that is the X of it is the limit of omega.

99
00:15:41,050 --> 00:15:45,880
So instead of one, it's less than one. Right.

100
00:15:46,510 --> 00:15:52,540
And this, in turn, means that I can find this, said A.

101
00:15:54,490 --> 00:15:58,600
Such that its probability is greater than zero instead of zero.

102
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:08,540
Such that I will not have a calculus convergence of exam of the.

103
00:16:10,030 --> 00:16:16,220
Yes. And goes to infinity to render these.

104
00:16:16,470 --> 00:16:23,470
This is a sequence of numbers. So the calculus sounds and this is for any army in that a.

105
00:16:24,840 --> 00:16:27,840
That has a probability greater than zero.

106
00:16:29,410 --> 00:16:37,230
Uh, so repeating the, uh, some sequence ideas so I can find the subsequent sets and key.

107
00:16:39,210 --> 00:16:46,020
Such that so again in the calculus sense for every omega in the set a.

108
00:16:47,650 --> 00:16:58,660
The division of SMK subsequent members from the limits is going to be greater than they have so on and it's not going to go to zero.

109
00:17:01,330 --> 00:17:04,650
For any. Okay.

110
00:17:04,830 --> 00:17:20,360
And for some maps. Now.

111
00:17:21,980 --> 00:17:27,610
So if we're using this new way of describing it.

112
00:17:27,620 --> 00:17:34,250
So again, I can find a set. A host probability is greater than zero.

113
00:17:36,130 --> 00:17:42,160
Such that soap over the tails of the name it takes place than soap of the over the tail is zero.

114
00:17:45,130 --> 00:17:50,630
And then if it does not take place, then. It's actually none.

115
00:17:50,630 --> 00:17:57,590
Zero. So it's going to be separated from zero.

116
00:18:01,070 --> 00:18:08,310
This these for any. And.

117
00:18:10,620 --> 00:18:20,420
For any the. Okay.

118
00:18:20,660 --> 00:18:27,350
So I believe we're now ready to do proofs by contradiction with these statements.

119
00:18:27,880 --> 00:18:33,020
Um, let's do the theorem. Following up in our intuition.

120
00:18:33,020 --> 00:18:40,720
That's almost true. Convergence is stronger. So it's basically said that those almost truly.

121
00:18:41,470 --> 00:18:48,240
So it's. Then it's also goals and probability to x.

122
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:16,240
Contradiction. So suppose I have simultaneously that seven girls on this show and it's X, but.

123
00:19:18,540 --> 00:19:22,670
It actually does not go in for me, which it tracks.

124
00:19:35,220 --> 00:19:38,700
Then I can find absolutely great zero.

125
00:19:40,280 --> 00:19:48,650
So I'm taking the version of that X and not going to x probability.

126
00:19:48,710 --> 00:19:54,930
So this one. Right here.

127
00:20:02,470 --> 00:20:08,150
And one for a subsequent. That's later on.

128
00:20:10,380 --> 00:20:20,020
Well. So there exists an absolute greater than zero.

129
00:20:22,290 --> 00:20:26,490
Such that they can find a subsequent X and k.

130
00:20:28,710 --> 00:20:37,530
Such that my probabilities of deviations for all members of the sequence will be separated from zero.

131
00:20:45,670 --> 00:20:51,440
Zero. And this is in UK.

132
00:20:52,670 --> 00:21:01,100
One, two, three. And so on. And for some delta greater than zero rates.

133
00:21:01,100 --> 00:21:10,340
I have a top there. So now let's denote.

134
00:21:14,740 --> 00:21:18,610
By E key the events.

135
00:21:22,750 --> 00:21:26,590
And the probability. So these ones.

136
00:21:26,600 --> 00:21:32,010
Right. So which was a set of mean there's such that.

137
00:21:34,170 --> 00:21:38,010
K minus X where you take a lapse.

138
00:21:44,600 --> 00:21:51,500
Yeah. And so the. Ltd superior.

139
00:21:52,860 --> 00:21:57,420
Yes. Kid goes to infinity. All those sets he kicks.

140
00:22:00,690 --> 00:22:12,360
So by definition of limited superior. So this would be when the percent of army goes such that the event of deviation

141
00:22:12,360 --> 00:22:16,710
being greater than epsilon is basically occurring infinitely many times.

142
00:22:20,700 --> 00:22:27,800
It's a set of. It is such that it's an Cayman's tax.

143
00:22:29,780 --> 00:22:40,910
The absence. Is happening.

144
00:22:45,660 --> 00:22:57,280
You need to do many types. So then by definition.

145
00:23:00,870 --> 00:23:09,700
For any family that it. So let's call it B.

146
00:23:21,030 --> 00:23:30,000
And for any and I can find k greater than and such that.

147
00:23:31,940 --> 00:23:39,950
My X and k omega stacks of omega is going to be greater than have so.

148
00:23:42,860 --> 00:23:47,470
Right. So if it's happening infinitely many times. So when you take over, they cut.

149
00:23:47,810 --> 00:23:51,820
Uh. By the capital number.

150
00:23:52,470 --> 00:23:56,910
So I'm looking for the right part of the tale. The simplest one violation there.

151
00:23:58,120 --> 00:24:06,920
So deviation being greater than absolute. Okay.

152
00:24:07,340 --> 00:24:19,760
And so if this is happening, something like this right, then, uh, so X and K would not be converging to X of omega for this specific omega.

153
00:24:23,210 --> 00:24:31,730
So for the B external, the key is not converging.

154
00:24:32,330 --> 00:24:37,310
So if they have fixed line is not converging to arxiv.org and in the calculus since.

155
00:24:41,050 --> 00:24:48,700
Right. So then the assumption right there.

156
00:24:48,820 --> 00:24:52,840
So we have that almost true, a convergence is taking place.

157
00:24:54,280 --> 00:24:57,310
And except.

158
00:24:59,640 --> 00:25:05,400
That means the calculus convergence is happening for all except the set of measure zero.

159
00:25:05,910 --> 00:25:10,770
So that means that this be if this is the case, is a set of measures zero.

160
00:25:12,590 --> 00:25:18,960
But because. And convergence was truly X.

161
00:25:23,710 --> 00:25:28,090
The probability of B must be zero.

162
00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:40,550
Yes. For the elements of be this this convergence is not happening and almost true it means see, it can only be a set of measures zero.

163
00:25:43,230 --> 00:25:48,090
Okay. So that's that's one thing. And let's throw.

164
00:25:54,670 --> 00:26:01,870
That probability of B is actually greater than zero, in which case we arrive at a contradiction.

165
00:26:06,910 --> 00:26:13,630
So consider. Since the M.

166
00:26:16,250 --> 00:26:23,790
That by definition, our union's starting from an infinity of key.

167
00:26:26,250 --> 00:26:31,740
So this was the type of sense we considered when we defined limits superior.

168
00:26:33,260 --> 00:26:38,390
So such beams. So they are decreasing sets.

169
00:26:45,550 --> 00:26:54,340
And they have limits. He's super freaky.

170
00:26:57,060 --> 00:27:01,320
That's just not what's in Busan. That's my definition of a bean soup.

171
00:27:03,820 --> 00:27:15,790
And they are decreasing because the union is taking over a smaller set of a case with increasing them.

172
00:27:18,050 --> 00:27:25,780
And let's say. So is decreasing sense, so they have a limit.

173
00:27:25,780 --> 00:27:29,500
So the m those m goes to infinity.

174
00:27:30,250 --> 00:27:35,150
So that leaves solve that we denoted by B. Right.

175
00:27:35,180 --> 00:27:38,960
So that'll be sort of a case be up there.

176
00:27:46,060 --> 00:27:50,190
Then. So obviously.

177
00:27:58,610 --> 00:28:04,790
So if I take a AM, it's going to be part of the union that includes that.

178
00:28:11,890 --> 00:28:15,370
And then I can say that the probability of a.

179
00:28:24,020 --> 00:28:31,640
He's going to be. On the one hand, because we're saying it's not converging.

180
00:28:33,320 --> 00:28:38,210
In probability, the extend is not converging in the probability to x.

181
00:28:39,350 --> 00:28:42,560
Then this probability is separated from zero.

182
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:49,910
On the one hand and on the other hand.

183
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:59,710
The probability of b m is greater than the probability of m does.

184
00:28:59,770 --> 00:29:04,300
B is. This guy writes.

185
00:29:09,880 --> 00:29:16,030
So if I am is part of the team, then its probability is less of equal.

186
00:29:21,640 --> 00:29:28,450
And this guy goes to be of be by continued you probability.

187
00:29:42,670 --> 00:29:46,390
And P.O.V. before we found to be zero.

188
00:29:52,520 --> 00:29:56,590
That's from. The star statement.

189
00:29:57,460 --> 00:30:08,810
Right. So we definitely have something. Uh uh, we definitely have a contradiction because on the right we have this thing greater than zero.

190
00:30:08,810 --> 00:30:12,230
On the left we have it's equal to zero. So this can't happen.

191
00:30:17,960 --> 00:30:28,160
This is a contradiction. That completes the proof.

192
00:30:39,010 --> 00:30:46,800
Okay. So it would be nice to have some intuition.

193
00:30:47,850 --> 00:30:49,800
So now that this is the case, right?

194
00:30:49,860 --> 00:31:02,610
So I know that some x him going in probability to x, they would not be converging almost truly because this fact is only going one way.

195
00:31:05,730 --> 00:31:14,880
They are convergence and probability is weaker. So it's going from energy to the he's.

196
00:31:16,080 --> 00:31:20,910
We? Then. It's.

197
00:31:21,960 --> 00:31:28,760
Almost surely it x. And that means that there are examples.

198
00:31:36,670 --> 00:31:47,530
Well. Kids and girls and probably be with you to X but the almost true convergence.

199
00:31:48,660 --> 00:31:56,610
Is not taking place. And let's do one such example.

200
00:32:16,130 --> 00:32:22,140
Okay. So I'm going to index things by two indices, right?

201
00:32:22,280 --> 00:32:29,570
So I'm going to have. Index and an index.

202
00:32:29,580 --> 00:32:36,270
I like it and I will be going from one to L.

203
00:32:42,670 --> 00:32:48,430
Now it's clear that I can always reformulated into a new l uh, from that.

204
00:32:56,220 --> 00:33:04,350
By counting elements of that thing because it's essentially a loop and that's that loop, right?

205
00:33:04,770 --> 00:33:08,550
So the external one goes over and 1 to 3 and so on.

206
00:33:09,330 --> 00:33:13,620
The internal loop goes from one to M.

207
00:33:14,670 --> 00:33:20,310
And I can certainly let this nested loop count.

208
00:33:20,530 --> 00:33:30,490
Then, um, right inside it. So I'm not losing any generality by considering pairs of indices instead of one of them.

209
00:33:31,390 --> 00:33:37,360
It still remains countable. So then I can introduce events.

210
00:33:38,950 --> 00:33:53,080
So this is essentially enlisted. Low and is this low is the outer loop.

211
00:33:58,150 --> 00:34:13,130
I. Is that? And I'm going to consider the is closed intervals.

212
00:34:14,210 --> 00:34:17,340
I mean this one over and two I.

213
00:34:26,450 --> 00:34:34,040
And my random variable. Yes, i m will be the indicator of that.

214
00:34:43,640 --> 00:34:47,420
Now I'm also having the probability space.

215
00:34:48,230 --> 00:34:53,330
So my omega is the interval zero one.

216
00:34:56,370 --> 00:35:00,599
Cause all my I might in a so on and high they remain less so equal.

217
00:35:00,600 --> 00:35:05,850
And so those items will always be within the interval zero one.

218
00:35:13,150 --> 00:35:16,300
That's why we're taking on things like this.

219
00:35:18,070 --> 00:35:24,140
We have if being. So sigma algebra.

220
00:35:26,650 --> 00:35:28,330
Generated by these events.

221
00:35:28,780 --> 00:35:44,950
And so they'll just be disjoint for a while, then end goals and they will be overlapping when the increments of end and I'm taking the length.

222
00:35:47,790 --> 00:35:55,140
Right. So that's the simplest case. So that would allow me to.

223
00:35:58,220 --> 00:36:03,310
Fine probabilities of air. Let's do this.

224
00:36:03,610 --> 00:36:07,180
So the probability of a i n.

225
00:36:10,200 --> 00:36:18,290
The equal to the length of that interval. And that's the difference between right and left hand.

226
00:36:18,830 --> 00:36:23,640
And it's just one of. And this will go to zero.

227
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:27,090
Obviously as Allen goes to the finish.

228
00:36:36,560 --> 00:36:43,040
Now this interval is where my random variable takes a value of one.

229
00:36:43,430 --> 00:36:48,370
Right. So I am. As an indicator variable.

230
00:36:52,380 --> 00:37:01,340
I'm having a simple space here. It. So that's going to be equal to one.

231
00:37:02,720 --> 00:37:09,310
So my omega numbers. Numbers in zero one.

232
00:37:13,330 --> 00:37:20,260
That's going to be equal to one if I'm in that belongs to a and it's equal to zero otherwise.

233
00:37:27,030 --> 00:37:31,410
Right. And X equals two one.

234
00:37:31,910 --> 00:37:35,740
This is where. Yes, I.

235
00:37:35,880 --> 00:37:40,170
And is actually greater than epsilon.

236
00:37:40,980 --> 00:37:48,570
This epsilon is between zero and one. Right.

237
00:37:48,580 --> 00:37:57,930
So if we, uh, ask about the convergence in probability, so we should evaluate probabilities.

238
00:37:58,350 --> 00:38:02,520
I am greater than epsilon for any epsilon. Meaning that it's small enough.

239
00:38:03,370 --> 00:38:06,820
And so that can only happen on the sets.

240
00:38:06,830 --> 00:38:17,500
And for those variables and I have the probabilities going to zero, so the probability of x I am deviating from the limits.

241
00:38:18,850 --> 00:38:25,380
So the limit random variable. He's.

242
00:38:26,900 --> 00:38:35,300
X equals zero. And this is for any girl in zero one.

243
00:38:39,350 --> 00:38:45,940
And because of this guy. My construction.

244
00:38:48,640 --> 00:38:52,990
I will have X and the league in probability to it.

245
00:38:53,260 --> 00:39:12,230
It's. That's because the probability of X and deviating from x by anything larger than zero is so because that is a shrinking thing.

246
00:39:14,200 --> 00:39:18,730
It's going to be a zero. So let's now make a picture of what's happening.

247
00:39:20,220 --> 00:39:26,880
So when an is equal to one, I have only one eye that's going to be equal to one.

248
00:39:27,780 --> 00:39:36,580
So here is my interval zero one. And my indicator function.

249
00:39:37,710 --> 00:39:42,420
My ex. I am. He's going to be that big thing.

250
00:39:42,840 --> 00:39:46,350
Right. So it's just an impulse that's.

251
00:39:49,200 --> 00:39:52,730
That is. My ex won the one for me, though.

252
00:39:52,890 --> 00:39:54,270
That's a graph of it, right?

253
00:39:57,440 --> 00:40:07,670
So for an equals one I have an interval, uh, from I minus one I is on for one because it needs to be equal to M in this case.

254
00:40:08,450 --> 00:40:11,600
So it's from 0 to 1. That's the whole Omega.

255
00:40:12,950 --> 00:40:17,900
So they indicate is equal to one over the whole lot. Well, this is my only.

256
00:40:19,480 --> 00:40:25,500
That's the start. When I have any calls to, I have two situations.

257
00:40:27,980 --> 00:40:41,330
I have pi equals one and I equals two. And my the size of my interval where x I am is is equal to one is now half of the full omega.

258
00:40:41,960 --> 00:40:51,810
So if I equals one, it's going to be like this. So that's next to one of the.

259
00:40:53,620 --> 00:40:57,460
Again. This is zero. This is one five. This is one.

260
00:41:02,760 --> 00:41:08,120
This is one equals one and this is one equals two because there is two.

261
00:41:08,130 --> 00:41:14,970
So I girls. Than two. That's when it's going to take the other.

262
00:41:17,290 --> 00:41:28,100
Place from one half to one. And you can imagine what's going to happen, right?

263
00:41:29,180 --> 00:41:35,570
Is my aim is increasing. So I will have a picture.

264
00:41:35,870 --> 00:41:41,240
Where? So will start with an impulse like this.

265
00:41:41,840 --> 00:41:49,940
And this the impulse with I is going to go all the way to the right, the end of the interval.

266
00:41:53,090 --> 00:42:03,830
It's it's going to be running like this if you if I do a cartoon changing these pictures over I I will see the the impulse running from left to right.

267
00:42:05,090 --> 00:42:15,470
And as I'm doing my nested loop over and and then within that over, I, I will see the impulse running from left to right repeatedly.

268
00:42:15,800 --> 00:42:22,250
But each time it completes that cycle, it's going to shrink because its size is one over here.

269
00:42:27,160 --> 00:42:32,190
So impulse. With.

270
00:42:34,180 --> 00:42:39,750
And I think increasing. It's running.

271
00:42:45,300 --> 00:42:50,330
From left. To write.

272
00:42:53,380 --> 00:43:01,760
And shrinking. The rates of one over 11.

273
00:43:08,470 --> 00:43:12,910
So that shrinking care that gives us convergence in probability, obviously.

274
00:43:13,720 --> 00:43:21,130
Right. Because the probability is length of that based on the impulse, it's going to zero.

275
00:43:22,720 --> 00:43:26,440
So that is the convergence in probability.

276
00:43:26,440 --> 00:43:29,470
That would just the noted above.

277
00:43:29,950 --> 00:43:33,010
Right. So but what about convergence? Almost surely.

278
00:43:33,340 --> 00:43:39,490
So convergence almost surely X and so X is not happening.

279
00:43:41,310 --> 00:43:49,600
Because. There is always so for any and.

280
00:44:00,410 --> 00:44:05,330
And it's equal and right. There's always an army there.

281
00:44:18,110 --> 00:44:35,850
Actually for all the Omega. So the.

282
00:44:38,350 --> 00:44:43,750
The difference is going to be greater than epsilon.

283
00:44:48,400 --> 00:44:54,250
For some. I am ready to go out.

284
00:44:57,280 --> 00:45:07,320
Right. So if I fix a go. Regardless of what my aim is.

285
00:45:11,640 --> 00:45:15,180
That's being also fixed in this context.

286
00:45:17,410 --> 00:45:23,710
So my shrinking impulse when I moves it to the right.

287
00:45:24,100 --> 00:45:28,120
So at some point it will be right over on the right.

288
00:45:28,120 --> 00:45:31,810
And this is where this thing is going to be happening.

289
00:45:37,110 --> 00:45:42,930
And that's regardless of the maker. That's because the impulse each time covers all of their own egos.

290
00:45:43,170 --> 00:45:52,410
Right. So regardless of which candidate I choose and fix and look at it, I will find that at some point.

291
00:45:53,340 --> 00:46:06,110
Uh, for some. Sufficiently large and actually for any seeks them because I will move the impulse over all of the on it goes.

292
00:46:06,110 --> 00:46:11,630
So there will be a point where the impulse is right on top of the Omega,

293
00:46:12,110 --> 00:46:22,280
where this will be equal to one and that's going to be greater than a small epsilon, greater than zero.

294
00:46:22,790 --> 00:46:26,690
That is required for convergence, almost surely.

295
00:46:32,470 --> 00:46:43,500
So that was the example. Let's do some language.

296
00:46:52,620 --> 00:46:56,540
And. Impulse.

297
00:46:57,570 --> 00:47:08,130
Well, for some, I. Be over.

298
00:47:10,020 --> 00:47:16,620
Any. Six stomach. Zero one.

299
00:47:20,370 --> 00:47:25,690
So that actually means that X and x I.

300
00:47:26,250 --> 00:47:29,630
Yeah. He's not going to be converging.

301
00:47:30,520 --> 00:47:33,850
To. Next so far, which is zero.

302
00:47:41,340 --> 00:47:49,560
Not only for some sense of probability as zero, but for actually settling measure one.

303
00:47:49,710 --> 00:48:02,140
Right. So everywhere. Okay.

304
00:48:14,080 --> 00:48:22,150
So we mentioned that, uh, convergence in probability is weaker.

305
00:48:25,790 --> 00:48:30,650
And then. Convergence, almost surely.

306
00:48:33,720 --> 00:48:44,400
And this means. There might be.

307
00:48:48,990 --> 00:49:05,920
An additional condition. Such that if I have convergence and probability.

308
00:49:08,500 --> 00:49:12,870
And. An additional condition.

309
00:49:20,500 --> 00:49:26,350
There might be a convergence, almost surely in this case.

310
00:49:32,210 --> 00:49:38,000
And. It was low.

311
00:49:38,350 --> 00:49:48,550
The battery. I don't know what this was.

312
00:49:53,910 --> 00:50:06,720
So we can formulate it as a theorem. So suppose we have convergence in probability x and two x.

313
00:50:08,620 --> 00:50:13,600
And. Suppose that it's an.

314
00:50:14,970 --> 00:50:18,390
These and monotonic sequence.

315
00:50:26,900 --> 00:50:38,660
Almost surely. And monotonic over in.

316
00:50:41,660 --> 00:50:54,620
So that means if I saw me go and look at x and omega is a sequence of numbers, they are monotonic, either not increasing or decreasing.

317
00:50:55,760 --> 00:51:00,200
And that happens for every single Onaga, except perhaps a set of measures there.

318
00:51:03,140 --> 00:51:08,330
It's something like this. So for me, it looks like this.

319
00:51:11,090 --> 00:51:14,190
So one. Three.

320
00:51:15,480 --> 00:51:22,880
So on September. That's the sound of a six Tomika.

321
00:51:23,330 --> 00:51:28,700
So they all look like that. Except, uh. Four sets of measures.

322
00:51:28,700 --> 00:51:40,240
Zero. And we'll do the proof after the break.

323
00:53:09,720 --> 00:53:15,170
What? That's what I want.

324
00:53:18,940 --> 00:53:31,810
So. Yeah.

325
00:53:33,180 --> 00:53:38,970
That that would leave the difference between this event in the home and a subset of measures that.

326
00:53:43,070 --> 00:53:49,060
Yeah. Theocracy is. Right.

327
00:56:57,460 --> 00:57:02,760
Okay. So we continue. So that's the theory.

328
00:57:03,710 --> 00:57:12,860
So it's one version of an additional condition that would make convergence and probability imply almost a convergence.

329
00:57:12,860 --> 00:57:15,530
That's the one that to me still makes sense sequence.

330
00:57:16,010 --> 00:57:28,160
So we briefly note that it will break the current example that we had with the impulse, because the sequence of ZM is not monotonic here.

331
00:57:28,170 --> 00:57:31,760
Right? So it's for any omega, it's zero for a while.

332
00:57:31,760 --> 00:57:39,169
Then when the impulses, although Omega becomes one and then four further members of the sequence, it's again zero, right?

333
00:57:39,170 --> 00:57:45,440
So it's going from 0 to 1 then back. So that's breaking that condition.

334
00:57:46,520 --> 00:57:49,670
Okay. So and for the proof.

335
00:57:50,060 --> 00:58:02,610
So without loss of generality. I will consider the limit being zero, right?

336
00:58:02,880 --> 00:58:08,820
Because if not, I can say that my new x is x minus the limit.

337
00:58:11,450 --> 00:58:15,200
Then my new ex will be zero as the limit of that thing.

338
00:58:16,010 --> 00:58:22,910
And I will also consider, without loss of generality, that axiom is a decreasing sequence.

339
00:58:28,600 --> 00:58:41,160
Because it doesn't matter whether it's increasing or decreasing. Uh, so if I have it increasing, uh, I can say my new axes minus my old ex.

340
00:58:43,000 --> 00:58:47,740
It's been turning an increasing sequence into a decreasing one.

341
00:58:52,340 --> 00:59:00,080
So these are continuously and that means that my extend is greater equals zero.

342
00:59:02,370 --> 00:59:05,880
And also my essay on Girls in probability to zero.

343
00:59:07,700 --> 00:59:12,530
After that without loss of generality, simplifications.

344
00:59:12,920 --> 00:59:19,700
Right. So just like I showed on the picture. Something like this.

345
00:59:20,570 --> 00:59:23,570
Okay, so. Thank you.

346
00:59:23,690 --> 00:59:44,600
We are proving it by contradiction. So we have all the conditions fulfilled but so extend those and from ability to access and fix them and the tiny.

347
00:59:46,480 --> 00:59:51,990
He's. Like these.

348
00:59:53,190 --> 01:00:01,260
Right. But nevertheless it's and is not converging on was truly two lax.

349
01:00:10,520 --> 01:00:14,030
What does that mean? So one of the terms of the definitions.

350
01:00:14,630 --> 01:00:20,870
Right. That means I can find this set a host probability is going to be greater than zero.

351
01:00:22,630 --> 01:00:31,240
Such that my so and greater equal and soon will be greater than the epsilon.

352
01:00:31,240 --> 01:00:37,000
Than epsilon is greater than zero. And this is for any of the E.

353
01:00:41,630 --> 01:00:46,520
So I'm choosing to characterize countless conversions by the super over the tape.

354
01:00:48,120 --> 01:00:59,460
Here. Right then of course it is some sense whose probability is greater than zero such that this is the case.

355
01:01:00,400 --> 01:01:05,830
Uh, but I can also say that there is a larger sense that this is a part of.

356
01:01:08,110 --> 01:01:14,040
And this is a sad. So and critical.

357
01:01:14,140 --> 01:01:17,320
And it's an everyday capsule.

358
01:01:17,560 --> 01:01:24,040
Right. So when I'm defining an event like these, that means all of them go.

359
01:01:25,980 --> 01:01:29,889
Such that. This thing is happening.

360
01:01:29,890 --> 01:01:40,780
Right. So, a, was some say up where this is happening and it's certainly part of a set up where I include all of is where this is happening.

361
01:01:44,380 --> 01:01:48,040
So that means because of that.

362
01:01:49,540 --> 01:01:56,500
So my probability of E is going to be less or equal, the probability of this.

363
01:01:56,770 --> 01:02:01,540
So yeah, I'm great and in great times.

364
01:02:09,230 --> 01:02:12,350
And on the other hand.

365
01:02:13,430 --> 01:02:19,970
So by assumption, by the definition of A, that probability is larger than zero.

366
01:02:24,430 --> 01:02:28,750
Okay, then. So here is where this starts working.

367
01:02:30,060 --> 01:02:38,070
Because aim is not decreasing. Then what can we say about the super M?

368
01:02:38,880 --> 01:02:44,890
So it's not decreasing over in. Right.

369
01:02:48,470 --> 01:02:54,049
Decreasing. Not not decreasing. Getting confused, right?

370
01:02:54,050 --> 01:03:00,140
So I have a decreasing sequence of and so if I'm taking some of the largest value of that.

371
01:03:02,620 --> 01:03:06,280
Sam under that soup is actually the first one.

372
01:03:07,090 --> 01:03:16,460
If it's a decreasing sequence. So that's X of the first number where the table starts.

373
01:03:18,230 --> 01:03:27,760
And this is of course, everything is almost full. And because of that.

374
01:03:29,130 --> 01:03:32,650
Uh. So my three stars.

375
01:03:36,700 --> 01:03:40,330
Can be written with like this.

376
01:03:50,410 --> 01:03:59,450
Right. But here I essentially have a deviation of X and from zero, right?

377
01:03:59,450 --> 01:04:07,340
In the form of x. And because I have convergence and probability happening,

378
01:04:07,850 --> 01:04:19,760
then this is going to go to zero is and goes to infinity because x and converges probability to zero.

379
01:04:22,230 --> 01:04:27,440
Zero is my ex. Right.

380
01:04:27,590 --> 01:04:40,069
And I see that's the p of gays actually squeezed between something that goes to zero and also needs to be greater than zero.

381
01:04:40,070 --> 01:04:43,430
So there's no other way.

382
01:04:46,250 --> 01:04:50,150
For it to be greater than zero. That's a contradiction.

383
01:05:08,720 --> 01:05:19,270
Okay. So now that I have that heading convergence any minute, any city of the sequence to convergence in probability actually makes it almost true.

384
01:05:19,280 --> 01:05:25,190
A convergence I can prove an interesting corollary.

385
01:05:34,840 --> 01:05:45,700
So if I have X and I'm going to X on this trolley, then this happens if and only if.

386
01:05:46,810 --> 01:05:52,390
So because it's k minus x.

387
01:05:54,860 --> 01:06:05,810
All the key grades equal them. Girls in probability is in going to infinity.

388
01:06:07,580 --> 01:06:12,410
So this. Two zero.

389
01:06:15,450 --> 01:06:23,220
So you can see that this is, uh, kind of yet another, uh, condition.

390
01:06:25,560 --> 01:06:33,540
Right. So if this went to to zero in probability, that would not be enough.

391
01:06:33,550 --> 01:06:45,060
But saying that it's a uniform kind of convergence in probability in that would take a suf which is a stronger condition and required to go to zero.

392
01:06:45,660 --> 01:06:49,030
So that's actually in that form of true convergence of moral.

393
01:06:49,540 --> 01:06:56,200
Moreover, it's it's equivalent to it. So let's do the proof.

394
01:06:57,960 --> 01:07:01,640
And it's going to be a consequence of the previous. Zero.

395
01:07:02,480 --> 01:07:05,970
So let's say. Um.

396
01:07:06,660 --> 01:07:11,680
Let's introduce annotation. So y n is going to be the super.

397
01:07:13,780 --> 01:07:20,090
Okay. Great. One. He wants tax.

398
01:07:22,390 --> 01:07:26,920
Right. It's still around the variable in this form.

399
01:07:26,920 --> 01:07:32,080
There's no probabilities attached for it. So it's still it's on the right path as a function of omni.

400
01:07:32,260 --> 01:07:43,030
So that's a random variable y and uh, so with how does it behave with them because it's a sub taken all of the smaller and smaller tail.

401
01:07:43,450 --> 01:07:49,060
So that's going to be a decreasing thing. So an is a decreasing sequence.

402
01:07:58,010 --> 01:08:06,400
Of them. And also it's a non-negative sequence.

403
01:08:11,440 --> 01:08:22,540
Right. So we'll start with sufficiency. So the right part of my equivalent statement up on top.

404
01:08:23,350 --> 01:08:29,440
Is that why? There was a probability to zero.

405
01:08:37,280 --> 01:08:46,080
I need to. Kind of get convergence out of it.

406
01:08:48,420 --> 01:08:54,420
So it gets Y and satisfies the previous theorem as a decreasing sequence.

407
01:08:56,140 --> 01:09:06,060
Uh, that that has a limit in probability. Is the previous theorem.

408
01:09:11,760 --> 01:09:19,710
And. That means that we'll be converging almost surely to zero.

409
01:09:34,540 --> 01:09:41,110
And that's the end of the sufficiency. And then the necessity.

410
01:09:53,270 --> 01:09:56,849
So my. It's an. Girls.

411
01:09:56,850 --> 01:10:05,580
Almost surely. Two X. Then this means that super.

412
01:10:06,620 --> 01:10:12,170
He greets equal and. It's K minus tax.

413
01:10:13,900 --> 01:10:17,560
Those 201 was truly.

414
01:10:21,120 --> 01:10:27,810
And then almost sure convergence implies convergence in probability.

415
01:10:33,900 --> 01:10:37,680
So then this. So came great people and.

416
01:10:41,370 --> 01:10:46,590
It's we'll be going from a religion to zero. And that's the end of.

417
01:10:49,050 --> 01:10:55,560
Necessity. Okay.

418
01:10:56,310 --> 01:11:11,190
So next time we'll show, uh, one more useful, uh, test or additional condition that can make sure convergence of, out of convergence in probability.

419
01:11:11,850 --> 01:11:22,170
And this will be that the convergence of probability happens faster than in the definition.

420
01:11:23,480 --> 01:11:29,270
So if we put some condition on how fast it goes, the probabilities of deviations go to zero.

421
01:11:30,320 --> 01:11:34,730
Then this would imply the almost triple convergence.

422
01:11:35,210 --> 01:11:40,820
Well, that will be in the next lecture. So that's it for today.
