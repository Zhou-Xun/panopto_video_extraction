1
00:00:00,090 --> 00:00:04,650
Used to be right here, I wonder why they moved it. Wow, that's not I would have sworn sparkle.

2
00:00:04,650 --> 00:00:18,480
Pony Mount was right here. I what's going on? Yeah, I don't know what the Princess Dream world is about the stuffed animal in my pocket.

3
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:23,310
Wait, Randy and I were still using that rocket. We still have some soft power left.

4
00:00:23,310 --> 00:00:39,640
Who is your friend who likes to play? No, you can't take my rocket to the top three and I go to the Moon.

5
00:00:39,640 --> 00:00:50,690
All right, we can't be done with me.

6
00:00:50,690 --> 00:00:56,150
Hey, it's going to be OK. We can fix this. We just need to get back to headquarters.

7
00:00:56,150 --> 00:01:01,440
Which way to the train station? I had a whole trip planned for us.

8
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:07,550
Hey, who's jingle is higher goes the Jingle Monster.

9
00:01:07,550 --> 00:01:12,050
Hi, Bing, Bong, look at this boy. All right, all you.

10
00:01:12,050 --> 00:01:17,360
Oh, here's a fun game. You point to the train station and we all go there.

11
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:25,160
Won't that be fun? Come on, let's go to the train station. I'm sorry they took your rocket.

12
00:01:25,160 --> 00:01:29,720
They took something that you loved. It's gone forever.

13
00:01:29,720 --> 00:01:35,360
Sadness, don't make him feel worse. Sorry. It's all I had left of Riley.

14
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:44,400
I bet you and Riley had great adventures. Oh, they were wonderful once we flew back the time we had breakfast twice that day.

15
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:48,530
Sadness sounds amazing. I bet Riley liked it.

16
00:01:48,530 --> 00:01:56,980
Oh, she did. We were best friends. Yeah, it's sad.

17
00:01:56,980 --> 00:02:07,380
Oh oh, oh oh.

18
00:02:07,380 --> 00:02:19,690
I'm OK now. It's come up, the train station is this way.

19
00:02:19,690 --> 00:02:25,240
How did you do that? I don't know. He was sad, so I listen to work.

20
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:39,190
There's the train. Oh, we made it.

21
00:02:39,190 --> 00:02:45,970
We're finally got all these facts and opinions look so similar.

22
00:02:45,970 --> 00:02:49,127
Don't worry about it happens all the time.
