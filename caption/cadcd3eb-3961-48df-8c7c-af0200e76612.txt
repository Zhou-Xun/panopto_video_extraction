1
00:00:56,390 --> 00:01:03,260
I need to talk about. Yeah. You want to forget my here?

2
00:01:03,650 --> 00:01:13,620
Oh, yeah. Yeah. We can start.

3
00:01:17,880 --> 00:01:21,720
All right. Welcome, everybody. Hope you guys had a great break.

4
00:01:22,350 --> 00:01:24,960
A little small break before the big break.

5
00:01:28,110 --> 00:01:35,489
Before we get started, I do want to just remind everybody that we have to our two final assignments, December six and December 16th.

6
00:01:35,490 --> 00:01:42,719
So your IDPs are due on the sixth and then your epic apex products are due on the 16th.

7
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:46,350
And that is our final assignment for the semester.

8
00:01:47,760 --> 00:01:51,870
And today we're talking about graduation.

9
00:01:53,950 --> 00:02:00,969
So we have Carolina and now right here hear at this point here we have Carolina.

10
00:02:00,970 --> 00:02:07,570
And over here they're going to help answer any questions that you have about getting ready to graduate.

11
00:02:08,220 --> 00:02:12,780
Yes, I just said that.

12
00:02:12,790 --> 00:02:17,430
But the purpose of this session is to ensure that you are all prepare for graduation here in Japan.

13
00:02:20,230 --> 00:02:25,750
So we'll all be here to answer any questions that you have and give you all the tools that you need that we've already been giving you.

14
00:02:25,750 --> 00:02:31,420
But we're going to reiterate everything that you need so that you all be successful before graduation.

15
00:02:32,620 --> 00:02:40,870
So if you haven't already done this, which the people in this room probably already have signed up for a degree audit.

16
00:02:40,870 --> 00:02:44,900
So if you're a GEO or 40 credit GE student, you sign up with me.

17
00:02:45,700 --> 00:02:51,980
If you're 80 or me student, you're signed up with Carolina and these life will be posted.

18
00:02:52,630 --> 00:02:56,080
You should have our links, but if you don't, they're linked here.

19
00:02:58,990 --> 00:03:06,550
So I've been getting a lot of emails and chats about the credit reduction process,

20
00:03:06,970 --> 00:03:10,120
and so I kind of want to take some time to kind of go through how that works.

21
00:03:10,690 --> 00:03:15,640
If you haven't already submitted your credit reduction request, this is what you will do.

22
00:03:15,790 --> 00:03:23,059
So obviously you should have already registered your internship with the Careers Office, but if you haven't, then you still can do that.

23
00:03:23,060 --> 00:03:29,650
If you have time to do that, if you need. The step by step of how to register your internship, just send me an email and I'll send it to you.

24
00:03:30,700 --> 00:03:34,930
And then the next step is obviously to complete your summer internship, which you already have done.

25
00:03:35,830 --> 00:03:40,090
So then you'll submit a credit reduction request on the House, and this is where it gets kind of tricky.

26
00:03:41,110 --> 00:03:47,559
So I'm the first person to approve this. So what I'll do, what I normally do is go verify that you did an internship.

27
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:49,540
Who you did it with all the information is correct.

28
00:03:49,870 --> 00:03:56,020
Verify all the amount of hours coincide with the amount of hours of credit that you're asking to be reduced.

29
00:03:57,220 --> 00:04:00,970
I approve them once a week on Monday. That's the day I try to.

30
00:04:00,970 --> 00:04:08,020
As long as I'm in the office, then the person that you put on is your track leader or faculty advisor will approve.

31
00:04:08,500 --> 00:04:17,330
They do this on their own timeline. So if weeks go by and they haven't approved it, sometimes I give them a nudge and ask them to approve it.

32
00:04:18,220 --> 00:04:25,780
Then once they approve it, it goes to the registrar's office. He approves them once a month in a big batch.

33
00:04:26,530 --> 00:04:35,890
So if you've already done your credit reduction request last month, it may not get approved until this month.

34
00:04:36,190 --> 00:04:39,610
Or if you've done it this month, it may not get approved until next month.

35
00:04:40,420 --> 00:04:47,110
Does that make sense? Okay. And then once it's all approved, then Elvira gets it and it goes on.

36
00:04:47,110 --> 00:04:54,640
Your transcript. And now we've been drilling this in your heads and you know all about it.

37
00:04:55,540 --> 00:04:59,110
But Apex is a graduation requirement.

38
00:04:59,290 --> 00:05:07,240
It is not something that if it is asking you to do, even though we are asking you to do it, it is a graduation requirement.

39
00:05:08,620 --> 00:05:12,430
So it has to be completed or you cannot graduate.

40
00:05:14,900 --> 00:05:18,470
Okay. Carolina.

41
00:05:18,860 --> 00:05:24,520
It is coming. Hi, guys.

42
00:05:25,810 --> 00:05:31,250
So flow modules, please make sure you complete these as soon as possible.

43
00:05:31,270 --> 00:05:38,290
I'm going to send an email out to everybody I can probably next week because we have a lot of things going on in the office right now.

44
00:05:38,470 --> 00:05:43,930
But probably next week I will be sending out a reminder for you all to complete this,

45
00:05:43,930 --> 00:05:50,830
and I will individually go in and see who has not completed it, and I will personally come for you.

46
00:05:52,120 --> 00:06:00,210
Okay. This is for preparing for graduation, like the instruction.

47
00:06:00,220 --> 00:06:02,770
So this is just to let you know what's going to happen,

48
00:06:02,770 --> 00:06:09,220
how this goes beyond the look out for an email to apply to graduate from the registrar, which is now Steve Molnar.

49
00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:17,860
If you didn't know Cathy Hastings, she is no longer with us anyway, so he will be sending that out to Andrea.

50
00:06:18,110 --> 00:06:22,330
Yes. Oh, yeah. Oh, Lord. It seems like she's gone.

51
00:06:22,780 --> 00:06:32,720
It's kind of like she's gone to the Lord. I'm sorry. No, no, she's she's at a different part of you about like she is still alive and with us, Eddie.

52
00:06:33,370 --> 00:06:36,610
Good Lord. Okay, I'm hungry. That's really what this is about.

53
00:06:37,810 --> 00:06:42,820
No, it's just, like, no longer with us.

54
00:06:42,820 --> 00:06:46,570
Like what? Okay. Anyway, so she's not dead. She's still here.

55
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:51,490
But also. So what do you get? That email from Steve?

56
00:06:51,850 --> 00:06:57,790
Make sure you apply to graduate for the winter semester oh 2023, which I'm sure you know,

57
00:06:57,790 --> 00:07:03,120
but just, you know, some people need reminders and to walk in the ceremony if you choose to.

58
00:07:03,130 --> 00:07:05,590
There are two different applications, from what I'm understanding.

59
00:07:06,010 --> 00:07:11,740
So if you need any help with that, it should be listed out very well and the email that he's going to send.

60
00:07:12,130 --> 00:07:14,230
But if anything gets confusing, I guess let me know.

61
00:07:14,590 --> 00:07:20,110
And then some of the certificates require an application and Wolverine access to graduate as well.

62
00:07:20,740 --> 00:07:25,990
Do I know which one's off the top of my head right now? No, but I will show AP all of the certificates.

63
00:07:26,070 --> 00:07:31,299
Yeah, there you go. See, this one's the group that doesn't like that way.

64
00:07:31,300 --> 00:07:35,270
The system knows, like, oh, they want to graduate with your MPH and oh, this video.

65
00:07:35,290 --> 00:07:39,040
So they'll do automatically. Yes, that.

66
00:07:40,300 --> 00:07:41,110
All right.

67
00:07:41,110 --> 00:07:48,520
And then remember, you can find all of this information in your handbook, which is hyperlinked here, and you should have that information as well.

68
00:07:49,300 --> 00:07:54,250
And you can access it and your student folder, the highlights or the orientation canvas page.

69
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:59,610
Any questions? No.

70
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:06,660
No. Zero, zilch, nada. Anyone not know what the flow thing is that I'm talking about?

71
00:08:07,500 --> 00:08:10,650
Because some people last semester were like, I don't even know what that is.

72
00:08:11,550 --> 00:08:15,180
But if you know, then you're on the right path. Okay, then that should be it.

73
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:19,230
I don't know anything else either. Oh, that was fast.

74
00:08:19,770 --> 00:08:24,060
Oh, by the next month, next semester is the semester. I have a question.

75
00:08:24,330 --> 00:08:31,890
You guys are doing your audit. What are the common questions or issues or barriers that come up for Wolfram?

76
00:08:32,310 --> 00:08:39,990
For me, it depends on the track. For me moves a little different than everybody else, so they have their own specific questions.

77
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:49,319
But certificate questions I think is a common thing in terms of whether whether or not all of the requirements were fulfilled.

78
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:55,650
If you're doing a check, the whole internship versus not internship thing was kind of weird, but it's not required.

79
00:08:56,640 --> 00:09:02,520
And then, yeah, just making sure everything's in a row and credit reductions has been a big thing,

80
00:09:02,610 --> 00:09:07,830
you know, making sure, making sure those are actually in there and you're actually going to get credit.

81
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:13,230
I think those were the main questions, but the audits for me at least only take like up to 10 minutes.

82
00:09:13,590 --> 00:09:21,419
We just talk about how your day was and then I'll tell you how many credits you have you've completed so far and how many you have left to go.

83
00:09:21,420 --> 00:09:24,950
And by the time you're done, if you will have enough to graduate.

84
00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:33,720
So it's really fast. I don't bother you long, I promise. I think for me, for a G, e, 60 credit G is simple, easy, straight to the point.

85
00:09:33,750 --> 00:09:41,310
No problems unless there's a certificate question for you to credit where I kind of had to get into the meet and make sure that they

86
00:09:41,730 --> 00:09:47,910
take taken enough credits to reach 42 in that amount of time or to figure out which classes they're going to take on the session.

87
00:09:49,230 --> 00:09:54,030
And then it's pretty self-explanatory, too. So it just really just depends on the track.

88
00:09:54,030 --> 00:09:58,530
And if they took the classes they're supposed to take at the time we told them to take them.

89
00:09:58,810 --> 00:10:02,880
Right. Is the floor module part of the audit or is that.

90
00:10:03,510 --> 00:10:07,589
I've been asking in my in my audits like, hey, have you done this?

91
00:10:07,590 --> 00:10:10,710
But not every time just because we go so fast.

92
00:10:10,980 --> 00:10:18,180
But that's but that's why I'm going to send out. Yeah, that's why I'm going to send out an email next week in terms of who hasn't done it,

93
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:22,530
I may not paying everyone because from what I'm seeing already most have done it.

94
00:10:23,640 --> 00:10:28,830
But yeah, most have done it. I mean, maybe just in general suite just one time.

95
00:10:28,830 --> 00:10:32,130
But then after that, if you get a second email for me, that means I'm coming for you.

96
00:10:32,910 --> 00:10:36,000
So I create that flow and you're like that.

97
00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:38,220
We don't we probably should have, you know,

98
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:45,660
maybe at the end of the day when all the degree audits are done and I'm looking at the final list at the school with all your names on it,

99
00:10:46,170 --> 00:10:49,740
I have to mark off that. Yes. You've completed all the requirements.

100
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:56,879
Yes, you did have to mark off your flow and then yes, I have to mark off your API.

101
00:10:56,880 --> 00:11:02,670
So I have to check off for each and every one. Yeah. And I rely on them to make sure like I need to get there.

102
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:08,430
So you probably should add a little bit. Yeah. Well I think that'll come next round.

103
00:11:08,430 --> 00:11:16,559
Yeah. For the next cohort but yeah. You'll be getting an email from me regardless just to make sure and just you know, just to help me out.

104
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:23,490
Also just go ahead and check anyway. Even if you remember, sometimes you did the wrong thing, sometimes you didn't click submit.

105
00:11:23,490 --> 00:11:24,780
That happened a lot.

106
00:11:25,080 --> 00:11:33,840
So I'm just like when I send that email, like actually go in canvas and make sure you see the 100% or whatever it says on there, like one out of one.

107
00:11:33,840 --> 00:11:38,670
I think it's really easy. You just. It's just a checkmark.

108
00:11:39,210 --> 00:11:40,680
Yeah, I have something to add here.

109
00:11:40,680 --> 00:11:49,940
Probably this is really good, but since we are talking graduation, the biggest question I get once you guys have officially like what?

110
00:11:50,520 --> 00:11:55,020
When are you going to get your diploma? So that's important.

111
00:11:55,860 --> 00:11:58,240
It just dawned on me, I don't know anything about this forever.

112
00:11:58,380 --> 00:12:08,160
Okay, but so you graduate at the end, will you want at the end of April and then two weeks after graduation,

113
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:13,799
the final degree analysts that I was talking to you about is do like we'll have to get together.

114
00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:18,870
We'll look at that list. We'll I'll sign off on it. I get in there are sure to sign off on it.

115
00:12:19,290 --> 00:12:22,320
It's going to go to. So that's like two weeks after graduation.

116
00:12:22,650 --> 00:12:26,340
It goes to our registrar where they do a triple check.

117
00:12:26,340 --> 00:12:33,030
After we check that, they will double check everything again. When he signs off on it, it goes to the regents.

118
00:12:33,030 --> 00:12:36,390
The regents then does this what they do. I'm guessing it is the same thing,

119
00:12:36,750 --> 00:12:45,900
but it goes through a few hands before the Regents gives the registrar's office the green light to actually come for your degree.

120
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:56,310
So that won't happen and will probably end early July ish.

121
00:12:56,670 --> 00:13:00,739
So over the summer because. There's a lot of you there doing it for the whole university that's graduating.

122
00:13:00,740 --> 00:13:07,240
So it's not just, you know, epic. So you'll probably get your diploma.

123
00:13:07,270 --> 00:13:09,830
Like all of this will look beautiful with your names on.

124
00:13:09,850 --> 00:13:15,200
And I'll say over the summer, like August, maybe a little earlier, I want to give it a little grace.

125
00:13:15,710 --> 00:13:21,370
So make sure your addresses are up to date and we'll bring access because that's where they're going to mail in to.

126
00:13:21,380 --> 00:13:27,650
So if you're not up to date, if you know your move in, it may go to the email address and, you know, update your information.

127
00:13:29,390 --> 00:13:34,780
I was a spring grad and yeah, I did get mine a few months after.

128
00:13:34,790 --> 00:13:41,519
Yeah. The process to apply for graduation will be pretty straightforward.

129
00:13:41,520 --> 00:13:47,239
It's simple. Yeah. I go through a couple of button starts once you register to vote.

130
00:13:47,240 --> 00:13:50,900
We now have, I think, a video which I think he puts in some video.

131
00:13:51,110 --> 00:13:54,270
Oh, that's nice. Yeah, I. Here you.

132
00:13:55,250 --> 00:14:01,549
What about classes for next semester? You're going to have questions about classes for next semester or more.

133
00:14:01,550 --> 00:14:04,220
Students have any questions about what they need to register for.

134
00:14:04,370 --> 00:14:12,079
And already talking about that, I mean, we mentioned well, I have mentioned that both in the audit and then it could be different for each student,

135
00:14:12,080 --> 00:14:18,020
depending on what they've already taken last semester is normally the least amount of credits, usually pretty well.

136
00:14:18,020 --> 00:14:22,159
They didn't do what they were supposed to do, and then they have to make up those credits.

137
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:28,459
So they didn't take any electives in any of the other right spaces.

138
00:14:28,460 --> 00:14:37,250
Then a lot of them are taking a look at this semester and I guess this is more of a PSA, but you're required.

139
00:14:37,250 --> 00:14:38,659
Classes are required.

140
00:14:38,660 --> 00:14:47,330
So if like, yeah, that sounds crazy, but but like it can't be one of those things because we've had an issue or two where it's like,

141
00:14:47,330 --> 00:14:50,420
but I really wanted to take this before I graduated.

142
00:14:51,020 --> 00:14:55,010
Yeah. I mean, if you can teleport, that would be cool.

143
00:14:55,460 --> 00:15:00,530
But required classes are required. So those have to come first, whatever's left and you shouldn't.

144
00:15:00,530 --> 00:15:04,790
And for this group you shouldn't have many left. So it really shouldn't be any issues.

145
00:15:04,790 --> 00:15:08,749
But this just has come up as an issue a few times lately.

146
00:15:08,750 --> 00:15:13,430
So I guess now we have to like actually say that so required classes are

147
00:15:13,430 --> 00:15:17,059
required because they take precedence over any electives that you want to take.

148
00:15:17,060 --> 00:15:20,150
And even certificate classes.

149
00:15:20,150 --> 00:15:24,080
Yes, even certificate classes. At the end of day, you want champions.

150
00:15:25,130 --> 00:15:30,200
And it was tricky because it's still kind of stuff like all the world classes are being recorded and

151
00:15:30,890 --> 00:15:39,800
I don't know how what will happen in the winter is faculty will ask for record and I don't know,

152
00:15:39,890 --> 00:15:42,469
it's just tricky. It's hard to do too fast.

153
00:15:42,470 --> 00:15:50,959
At the same time, especially we're trying very hard to do in-person back to going for in-person, so which is at the request of the dean.

154
00:15:50,960 --> 00:15:56,020
So we kind of have to do what he says. Yeah.

155
00:15:56,410 --> 00:16:05,060
This sparked from the conversation. Nothing for grew.

156
00:16:05,590 --> 00:16:09,140
I feel like this group is like trying to wrap off the semester,

157
00:16:09,170 --> 00:16:15,610
get all my stuff done this semester with their assignment and already know what you're taking for next year.

158
00:16:15,670 --> 00:16:20,290
Working out those scheduling conflicts. I heard about some yeah.

159
00:16:20,300 --> 00:16:24,110
Special cases I think we talked about what to. Mm.

160
00:16:25,990 --> 00:16:32,340
Well go ahead. I think, you know we, you can help us understand what happens for graduation.

161
00:16:32,680 --> 00:16:40,570
Yeah. Next. So I think there's plenty of time if there is any question about the apex assignment.

162
00:16:40,630 --> 00:16:51,370
Yeah. I mean, I know we're kind of looking at them on a rolling basis now on the apex and the the progress report.

163
00:16:51,940 --> 00:17:00,710
So, you know, get those in. I think it's better to get the apex assignment then sooner than later so that we can give you feedback on the effort.

164
00:17:00,730 --> 00:17:05,140
I mean, like one sometimes like one little feedback here or there to address.

165
00:17:06,310 --> 00:17:14,320
They'll get a draft and I'll be fine. But you don't get those then, so you can take care of that with your I think a lot of the you know,

166
00:17:14,320 --> 00:17:17,740
again, like we're especially focusing on making sure all the components are there,

167
00:17:17,740 --> 00:17:23,160
making sure that the activities can really describe and mapped out the competencies and looking at the reflection.

168
00:17:23,550 --> 00:17:32,530
So for me, it's a really nice, you know, looking for to see what are I'm doing in all the great work that you've done to be able to learn like that.

169
00:17:33,130 --> 00:17:37,750
And also even for me, I started looking at some of the progress reports too,

170
00:17:37,750 --> 00:17:45,069
and I really enjoyed just reading about what you have learned, but you feel proud of how you overcome challenges.

171
00:17:45,070 --> 00:17:49,050
I mean, for me, I always learn my own strategies and I ideas myself from from all.

172
00:17:52,890 --> 00:17:55,960
This. I thought we had. Oh. I'm coming.

173
00:17:55,980 --> 00:18:09,840
Right. Have to scout. Oh, we thank you for the one or two people, though I this is not in 530 755.

174
00:18:11,610 --> 00:18:16,620
Oh, you wonder if that's just a good question.

175
00:18:16,650 --> 00:18:25,580
Okay. Yeah, but there's always a little confusion between, I guess for some directly what might be on there.

176
00:18:25,590 --> 00:18:32,190
They might need to know. So for her, yeah, the question was about EP at 530 and now there's the infographic fact sheet thing.

177
00:18:32,190 --> 00:18:40,950
There's a specific word count that does not apply to whatever you're turning in for the general requirement of the apex, I think because as you know,

178
00:18:40,950 --> 00:18:46,470
on 530, you're getting a little more in-depth review like you're you're learning those specific competencies and you're applying it.

179
00:18:46,860 --> 00:18:53,280
And I think for that class to be able to give you a more in-depth review and feedback, they do limit it.

180
00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:58,200
That's why. So you can use that for this, but it does not apply to the other products.

181
00:18:58,200 --> 00:19:03,240
We don't look at the word count at all. We really looking at that in a final ish form and that kind of thing.

182
00:19:03,570 --> 00:19:10,580
Good question. Q. All right, well,

183
00:19:10,580 --> 00:19:17,690
use this time to finish up all your homework and assignments and whatever you need to do and then come down if you have any individual questions or,

184
00:19:17,720 --> 00:19:21,620
you know, need anything about Apex or anything, just just come and talk to us.

185
00:19:22,460 --> 00:19:26,270
I will put a plug in the and look out for winter time.

186
00:19:26,660 --> 00:19:32,050
There will be a lunch with the chair and associate chair of the department.

187
00:19:32,060 --> 00:19:36,260
You may remember doing this last year where you can talk on the phone.

188
00:19:36,580 --> 00:19:41,659
Nothing like. Well, what they what works, what doesn't work and what that's be a big curriculum change.

189
00:19:41,660 --> 00:19:49,570
So put that in there. So that will be happening next semester and whatever that is going to be fairly each.

190
00:19:49,580 --> 00:19:57,350
Well, please. Yeah. That'll be really helpful to get your feedback about professional development class about anything.

191
00:19:57,350 --> 00:20:01,579
And this will be a really good time because the curriculum is getting revised and big changes are going to happen.

192
00:20:01,580 --> 00:20:04,640
So this is really a good time to give your feedback. Yes.

193
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:06,440
All right. Have a great day.
