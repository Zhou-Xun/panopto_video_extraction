Welcome to Epit, six thirty four's module on modeling transmission using mass action theory.

2
00:00:10,350 --> 00:00:14,760
In this module, I'll provide an overview of how transmission is modeled.

3
00:00:14,760 --> 00:00:21,090
Learning objected to this module are one to describe how models codify the transmission process

4
00:00:21,090 --> 00:00:27,060
using the theory of mass action and to capture the two approaches to modeling transmission,

5
00:00:27,060 --> 00:00:35,740
one using mass action theory and two, using a binomial process or approach developed by Reiden Frost.

6
00:00:35,740 --> 00:00:43,840
The law glass action originally was applied to chemical reactions where the rate of chemical reaction occurring is proportional to the product,

7
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:46,710
to the masses of the reacting substances.

8
00:00:46,710 --> 00:00:56,890
And this figure, if molecules A&E or well, mixed in a container mass action is modeling the probability that A comes into direct contact with B.

9
00:00:56,890 --> 00:01:02,820
When these molecules come into contact, they react to produce the products C and D,

10
00:01:02,820 --> 00:01:13,430
increasing the density of A and or B will increase the rate of a chemical reaction occurring, producing more of molecules C and D.

11
00:01:13,430 --> 00:01:20,070
Rosten Mackendrick were one of the first to propose applying mass action theory to transmission processes.

12
00:01:20,070 --> 00:01:27,540
The idea is that like chemicals, because we assume that people are randomly mixing in a homogeneous setting,

13
00:01:27,540 --> 00:01:32,930
that the rate of new cases would be proportional to the number of current cases.

14
00:01:32,930 --> 00:01:38,880
And the current number is susceptible receptacles where C is the number of cases.

15
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:44,150
As the number SEPTA, those are the transmission rate parameter.

16
00:01:44,150 --> 00:01:51,450
The multiplication of these two state variables gives us the unique non-linear feature of a transmission system.

17
00:01:51,450 --> 00:02:00,360
For example, when an infected end, when infect an infected individual enters a community of susceptible, we get an explosive.

18
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:10,410
We get explosive outbreaks. This is followed by a dramatic drop in cases once the susceptible population begin to be depleted.

19
00:02:10,410 --> 00:02:14,560
We also get the threshold of behavior that Rosten Mackendrick highlighted.

20
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:18,720
We're below a threshold number of susceptible. We don't get an outbreak.

21
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:24,720
That is the probability of a susceptible in a case meeting is too low.

22
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:35,550
Lastly, we get this interdependency where one's risk of becoming a case depends on the number of cases or the prevalence in the population.

23
00:02:35,550 --> 00:02:41,010
This last feature is a dramatic departure from our epidemiological paradigm,

24
00:02:41,010 --> 00:02:50,670
where our relative risk calculations depend on the assumption that becoming a case is independent of the presence of other cases.

25
00:02:50,670 --> 00:02:55,170
How do we implement a mass action transmission model at time?

26
00:02:55,170 --> 00:03:01,500
T We have the current number as susceptible as cases and removed or immune individuals

27
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:06,120
based on these numbers and an estimate of the transmission rate parameter.

28
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:13,050
We can then calculate the number of cases susceptible and removed at time T plus one.

29
00:03:13,050 --> 00:03:19,050
We do this by one, subtracting our times as time C from the current number,

30
00:03:19,050 --> 00:03:27,300
as susceptible as to setting the number of cases a T plus one equal to our times s time C that is,

31
00:03:27,300 --> 00:03:32,760
all cases from time to T are assumed to be recovered.

32
00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:40,360
And three, we add those cases from time T to the recovered state.

33
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:50,700
What are the assumptions for this model that govern the prediction of the number of susceptible cases and recovered at time T plus one?

34
00:03:50,700 --> 00:04:02,130
First, there is the assumption of homogeneity that is everyone has equal susceptibility to infection and everyone has equal capacity to transmit.

35
00:04:02,130 --> 00:04:07,470
Next, we assume that the timestep of the model equals the incubation period.

36
00:04:07,470 --> 00:04:17,460
That is during one timestep and expose susceptible. One that comes into contact with the case becomes a case related to this assumption

37
00:04:17,460 --> 00:04:22,380
is that the infectious period is short compared to the incubation period.

38
00:04:22,380 --> 00:04:28,500
This short infectious period means that the number of cases at time t.

39
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:32,940
All recover during the next timestep.

40
00:04:32,940 --> 00:04:46,300
We assume that infection spreads directly from cases to subtitles and that individuals have fixed probability of contacting others in the population.

41
00:04:46,300 --> 00:04:52,630
One important feature of our mass action transmission model that I mentioned before is the multiplicative effect,

42
00:04:52,630 --> 00:04:55,740
that is, the number of cases are multiplied by the number of susceptible,

43
00:04:55,740 --> 00:05:05,180
as we can illustrate this multiplicative effect through an example, assuming that there are nine hundred ninety nine susceptible and one infected.

44
00:05:05,180 --> 00:05:15,460
The product is nine hundred ninety nine. Has a number of cases decrease, increase in the number and the product has a number of cases increased.

45
00:05:15,460 --> 00:05:23,490
The product explodes or grows exponentially with 500 susceptible than 500 cases.

46
00:05:23,490 --> 00:05:32,190
Then this this product, the cases time susceptible, is dramatically increases to twenty five thousand.

47
00:05:32,190 --> 00:05:39,810
This, in turn dramatically increases the infection potential as a susceptible become depleted.

48
00:05:39,810 --> 00:05:47,490
The product dramatically decreases again. Another important feature,

49
00:05:47,490 --> 00:05:53,400
which is that a pen potential limitation is it is the fact that this simple equation has the

50
00:05:53,400 --> 00:06:00,190
ability to predict more cases at time T plus one than there were susceptible at time T.

51
00:06:00,190 --> 00:06:10,810
If we had one susceptible in 500 cases and if our is large enough that the model would predict more than one case for time T plus one.

52
00:06:10,810 --> 00:06:22,260
But this is not possible. So this limitation to the mass action model led read for us to develop an alternative transmission based.

53
00:06:22,260 --> 00:06:31,130
Transmission model based on mass action theory. Their model was based on the premise that contact between a given susceptible

54
00:06:31,130 --> 00:06:37,830
and one or more cases will produce only one new case to derive this new model.

55
00:06:37,830 --> 00:06:45,330
We start with the parameter key, which is the probability of a contact resulting in a transmission event.

56
00:06:45,330 --> 00:06:53,150
Then Q Which is one minus P is the probability of a contact not resulting in a transmission event.

57
00:06:53,150 --> 00:07:01,720
Given then, given all individuals move around independently and there are S.T. cases at any given time,

58
00:07:01,720 --> 00:07:12,570
Q to S.T. power is the probability an individual does not come into contact with any of the CTD cases.

59
00:07:12,570 --> 00:07:22,110
And one minus Q to S.T. power is a probability an individual comes into contact with one or more cases.

60
00:07:22,110 --> 00:07:28,680
We can use this expression one minus Q to the T t power as a scalar multiplier of the current number,

61
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:35,070
as susceptible as S of T to predict the number of new cases at time T plus one.

62
00:07:35,070 --> 00:07:43,650
The beauty of this model is that one minus Q to the S.T. power is always less than one.

63
00:07:43,650 --> 00:07:50,970
So we never get into the problem that we had with the mass action model.

64
00:07:50,970 --> 00:07:57,060
How does this Reed Cross model compare to the mass action model, we can get some insight here.

65
00:07:57,060 --> 00:08:04,110
By looking at what happens when the probability of transmission P is small under these circumstances,

66
00:08:04,110 --> 00:08:09,520
the Red Cross model simplifies to the mass action model.

67
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:16,060
We see this by first substituting Q for one minus P.

68
00:08:16,060 --> 00:08:23,950
And then noting when P is small, one minus Pete, the power approximates one minus C, t.

69
00:08:23,950 --> 00:08:30,380
Times P, which then simplifies to P.

70
00:08:30,380 --> 00:08:37,510
Times Saeki times A team. So the read Frost model simplifies to the mass action model.

71
00:08:37,510 --> 00:08:44,140
And this means the probability of infection approximates the transmission rate parameter.

72
00:08:44,140 --> 00:08:50,830
This is, of course, when P is small. It turns out that we are usually dealing with sufficiently small probabilities.

73
00:08:50,830 --> 00:08:56,410
So we can use the mass action model as an approximation of the Red Cross model.

74
00:08:56,410 --> 00:09:03,370
And therefore, we don't have to worry about the possibility, predicting more cases when there are few susceptible.

75
00:09:03,370 --> 00:09:05,590
Then there are susceptible.

76
00:09:05,590 --> 00:09:16,866
Therefore, due to its simplicity, almost all transmission models that you will encounter in the literature is based on mass action theory.
