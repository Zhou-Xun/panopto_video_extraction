1
00:00:00,550 --> 00:00:03,660
You think you actually know?

2
00:00:14,850 --> 00:00:19,540
Okay. Welcome back, everyone. Not exactly a packed house today.

3
00:00:19,650 --> 00:00:21,840
It's like Christmas. It's great.

4
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:33,550
So today I've been getting a lot of people coming to office hours, but just in case, I have a faculty meeting from 3 to 5 today.

5
00:00:33,570 --> 00:00:38,510
So I moved office hours from 2 to 3.

6
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:42,750
So if you wanted to come to office hours in that timeframe, that'll work.

7
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:46,740
Otherwise, I'm always available for individual meetings. Of course.

8
00:00:48,690 --> 00:00:54,490
Just double check that we're recording here. How's everything going?

9
00:00:55,570 --> 00:00:57,549
I think I'll leave. Most of the exams have been done.

10
00:00:57,550 --> 00:01:03,820
There was a couple people that had like different situations, but for the most part, I think exams seem to have been turned in.

11
00:01:04,090 --> 00:01:09,020
No big hiccups with the canvas side or anything. And then the papers.

12
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:13,570
How are you feeling about the papers? Good, I'm sure.

13
00:01:13,930 --> 00:01:17,500
So it says that the maximum is eight pages. I just want to make sure.

14
00:01:18,310 --> 00:01:24,460
Is there no minimum as long as we cover every all the information that is needed in the paper.

15
00:01:24,700 --> 00:01:29,390
Yeah, no. I mean, as long as it covers all the stuff that we asked you for that.

16
00:01:32,830 --> 00:01:38,280
Any other questions? Okay.

17
00:01:38,850 --> 00:01:42,310
I'm going to wrap up. I forgot to wrap up food talks.

18
00:01:42,330 --> 00:01:47,850
I just ran it. I just started air pollution. And I had to go back to a couple of slides related to food toxicology.

19
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:51,450
So I'll just wrap up with those like four slides or so.

20
00:01:51,750 --> 00:01:56,370
And then we're going to dive into risk assessment and basically from here on out.

21
00:01:56,430 --> 00:01:58,950
We're going to be tied to a different aspects of risk assessment,

22
00:01:59,910 --> 00:02:03,840
except for the last lecture is a little bit more about like the future of toxicology.

23
00:02:04,170 --> 00:02:13,319
But these next few lectures are kind of going to be sort of how we apply the science of toxicology in a risk assessment context,

24
00:02:13,320 --> 00:02:17,940
which is one of the like the critical areas that toxicology data are used to.

25
00:02:18,810 --> 00:02:26,880
Yeah. So you'll kind of see how this gets incorporated into this very sort of involved framework of risk assessment.

26
00:02:27,350 --> 00:02:33,179
So so this is where I think I left off with food toxicology.

27
00:02:33,180 --> 00:02:41,700
So we're just talking about we didn't talk a lot about toxins, but you're probably aware that certain types of seafoods can have toxins in them.

28
00:02:42,630 --> 00:02:47,940
And these have like zero tolerance under FDA policy. But there's like a range of neurotoxins.

29
00:02:48,270 --> 00:02:51,419
Some examples are given here. A lot of them are like acetylcholine.

30
00:02:51,420 --> 00:02:58,020
Esterase inhibitors have like really acute, really like severe effects of there's like species of fish,

31
00:02:58,020 --> 00:03:00,780
oysters and clams that have these types of effects.

32
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:07,680
You may have heard of like the pufferfish with the tetrodotoxin, which causes like nervous system paralysis.

33
00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:11,909
And there's like some people will like eat like a certain part of it.

34
00:03:11,910 --> 00:03:17,480
And there's like these really skilled chefs that apparently can, like, separate out the toxic part of the fish from the other part.

35
00:03:17,490 --> 00:03:22,200
It's like a delicacy, not something I would personally super be into trying.

36
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:29,429
But it's interesting this talks about the mechanism is like blocking these like cation movement.

37
00:03:29,430 --> 00:03:35,220
That's part of like a neurotransmission that Dr. Borkowski talked about a lot in her lecture.

38
00:03:36,040 --> 00:03:41,790
So you talk about things like muscle paralysis, respiratory distress and potentially death, right?

39
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:50,290
Remember there's an episode of The Simpsons early on where they thought a homer had died from eating like poisonous blowfish.

40
00:03:51,010 --> 00:03:56,620
That may show my age because I think it's one of the early seasons. He wasn't dead, though.

41
00:03:59,020 --> 00:04:06,520
So then we also have like micro biologic agents. So, like, you know, you see these like announcements all the time in the news with like,

42
00:04:07,660 --> 00:04:11,260
you know, maybe talking about like spinach has like E coli or something to that effect.

43
00:04:12,490 --> 00:04:17,200
And they happen, you know, they're always kind of I always, like, see them in the news and end up like texting my wife.

44
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:21,010
Like make sure not buy this brand of, you know, spinach or what have you.

45
00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:29,790
So these types of infections, you know, account for like 20,000 infections, hospitalizations and even deaths.

46
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:35,920
And this is data from 2013 from the CDC. But yeah, so this is like a significant issue.

47
00:04:36,370 --> 00:04:41,559
And we have things like botulinum toxin. You some of these others, you know,

48
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:51,040
these are just kind of various bacillus is from improperly prepared rice can cause vomiting you know toxicity and then E coli.

49
00:04:51,070 --> 00:04:52,870
E coli is probably the most common one.

50
00:04:52,870 --> 00:05:00,940
You hear about outbreaks associated with improperly prepared beef or like in unpasteurized vegetables or juices.

51
00:05:01,990 --> 00:05:09,690
Yeah. You know, the symptoms can include things like bloody diarrhea or gastroenteritis, etc.

52
00:05:09,700 --> 00:05:13,000
So I think we're probably fairly familiar with a lot of that.

53
00:05:14,970 --> 00:05:17,980
Have you heard of mad cow disease? Yeah.

54
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:25,380
So mad cow is this really kind of wild biology in terms of what is underlying the.

55
00:05:25,390 --> 00:05:35,250
So, um, this, uh, this bovine spongiform encephalopathy, is this like fatal or otherwise known as mad cow?

56
00:05:35,250 --> 00:05:42,630
Is this fatal neurodegenerative disease and it causes this spongy degeneration of the brain tissue in neuronal tissue.

57
00:05:43,170 --> 00:05:52,049
Is that the thing that's like transmitting this effect in this case is this type of misfolded proteins called a prion, which is very odd.

58
00:05:52,050 --> 00:05:55,560
It's like almost like a virus, but not really.

59
00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:59,100
It can cause other proteins to mass fold.

60
00:05:59,100 --> 00:06:07,170
So it sort of acts in this like infectious way almost, but it's not really alive in the proper sense because it's just a protein.

61
00:06:08,430 --> 00:06:14,430
And so this can get into it's really wild like I could I love to like dive into this biology bar.

62
00:06:15,100 --> 00:06:21,330
It sounds like something from science fiction, but it can be humans can be exposed by eating meat that's contaminated.

63
00:06:21,900 --> 00:06:29,190
You can find it in like brain or spinal cord tissue or in the digestive tracts of animals that are infected with this prion.

64
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:35,580
Yeah. And killed like almost 200 people in the UK by 2014.

65
00:06:35,940 --> 00:06:39,839
It's like super stable, you know, like high temperatures, which is really kind of scary,

66
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:43,020
you know, it's like cooking it even like high levels of high temperatures.

67
00:06:43,020 --> 00:06:46,200
It's not going to necessarily degrade this prion.

68
00:06:46,620 --> 00:06:52,169
So that's one to really. Yeah, like I said, almost like science fiction.

69
00:06:52,170 --> 00:07:04,650
Any type of biology? No, I go there. So in summary, food is complex, as we talked about, comprised of nutrients and nutrient chemicals.

70
00:07:05,100 --> 00:07:11,700
We talked about the way the U.S. government is regulating food and where there is like important sort of like gaps or like areas where

71
00:07:11,700 --> 00:07:18,570
we could emphasize more in terms of characterizing what was happening during food preparation and the potential for food contamination.

72
00:07:19,780 --> 00:07:25,269
Um, yeah. Components of food can influence how we metabolize certain toxic substances.

73
00:07:25,270 --> 00:07:29,219
So we talk about like the grapefruit juice and certain other types of things that

74
00:07:29,220 --> 00:07:34,980
can be introduced in our into our diet can kind of alter how we metabolize,

75
00:07:34,980 --> 00:07:38,340
say, like pharmaceuticals. And so there are certain cases where we have to be careful of that.

76
00:07:40,500 --> 00:07:45,060
And then we talk about the ways in which toxicants can be generated during food production.

77
00:07:45,150 --> 00:07:50,060
Growing contaminated soil in the plant, that's like packaging the food.

78
00:07:50,100 --> 00:07:54,210
There's various areas where we can get contamination.

79
00:07:57,060 --> 00:08:05,550
And we, you know, I showed some data from Dr. Aquino's work and others that where, you know, if you go and take food from a grocery store,

80
00:08:05,580 --> 00:08:13,290
you may find that toxicants that shouldn't be there that are like not sort of approved by the FDA for being present in these foods.

81
00:08:13,290 --> 00:08:21,900
So we have a ways to go in terms of like really understanding and like fully, like regulating our food supply.

82
00:08:22,570 --> 00:08:27,719
Um, and then again, we just ended with these like toxins from like fungi,

83
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:34,200
bacteria or mammals, seafood, etc. Those can cause public health issues of concern as well.

84
00:08:34,560 --> 00:08:38,210
So wrap that up. Sorry for skipping over that.

85
00:08:38,760 --> 00:08:42,600
Anyone have any comments or questions before we dive into the next topic?

86
00:08:45,650 --> 00:08:49,280
And it's something interesting. I mean, who doesn't love talking about food, right?

87
00:08:50,270 --> 00:08:58,560
So. Okay.

88
00:08:59,780 --> 00:09:01,970
So now we're going to jump into risk assessment.

89
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:12,720
Stephen Gilbert is a professor at the University of Washington, has this nice quote about the goal of risk assessment.

90
00:09:13,790 --> 00:09:21,920
The idea is to ensure conditions that ensure that all living things have the best opportunity to reach and maintain their full genetic potential.

91
00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:28,730
So that's just kind of a nice quote. He's really big in the field of risk assessment and toxicology.

92
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:30,890
So that's a nice quote from him.

93
00:09:32,540 --> 00:09:40,510
I'm curious how many people in here might have already had some type of experience in risk assessment, like the risk assessment framework?

94
00:09:40,520 --> 00:09:47,990
Have you worked in jobs or done research that is somehow incorporating the risk assessment framework into what you do?

95
00:09:49,910 --> 00:09:53,390
Can you share with us like in what capacity? Yeah.

96
00:09:53,930 --> 00:09:56,089
So it was while I was engineering,

97
00:09:56,090 --> 00:10:03,450
so it was kind of like an infrastructure sort of risk assessment we looked at for water mains and sanitary sewers and storm surge.

98
00:10:03,470 --> 00:10:08,720
We looked at the condition of the pipe, who the recipients of whatever is going through that pipe,

99
00:10:09,110 --> 00:10:12,320
who they are, whether it's like a hospital or school or residential community.

100
00:10:13,010 --> 00:10:18,600
And. Parameters with a score of how severe it would be.

101
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:22,769
Yeah, yeah, yeah. That's a good that's a good example.

102
00:10:22,770 --> 00:10:28,409
So this is more of an engineering situation where based on what I gleaned from that,

103
00:10:28,410 --> 00:10:39,780
like the type of piping used or the type of damage to the pipe or something associated with certain a certain risk that a certain event might occur.

104
00:10:39,990 --> 00:10:43,170
Right. Right. Kind of. Okay. So yeah, exactly.

105
00:10:43,170 --> 00:10:48,030
So like you can apply this framework into areas outside of like, say, toxicology.

106
00:10:48,030 --> 00:10:56,280
You could do a risk assessment for the, um, the capacity for this building to like withstand an earthquake of different magnitudes, for example.

107
00:10:56,580 --> 00:11:01,440
And in that case, the sort of corollary there in terms of dose response might be looking at, you know,

108
00:11:01,830 --> 00:11:08,489
a 2.0 magnitude earthquake versus a five versus like a whenever, whatever, 7.0 magnitude earthquake.

109
00:11:08,490 --> 00:11:14,580
So you can kind of take this and your sort of outcome in that case might be that the building is still standing, for example.

110
00:11:14,580 --> 00:11:18,720
So you can kind of apply this in a lot of different settings, not just toxicology,

111
00:11:18,990 --> 00:11:24,990
but toxicology definitely is one one of the main areas where this type of framework is used.

112
00:11:25,410 --> 00:11:28,770
Did you want to? Yeah, I did a risk assessment.

113
00:11:28,770 --> 00:11:33,120
But in the other area. But it's related to toxicology.

114
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:43,019
I did this on for environmental consulting in petroleum industry, for example,

115
00:11:43,020 --> 00:11:54,830
countries as people of oil or petroleum oil or any economic chemical related to the to petroleum.

116
00:11:54,850 --> 00:12:01,229
So we did risk assessment to measure the environment,

117
00:12:01,230 --> 00:12:08,309
the damage to the environment surrounding the spill and everything that that kind of risk assessment did.

118
00:12:08,310 --> 00:12:12,360
I did, yeah. So like an ecological risk assessment in a way, right?

119
00:12:13,380 --> 00:12:21,290
Yeah, that's great. And you may have done, you know, in thinking about that like different sizes of oil spill it.

120
00:12:21,620 --> 00:12:24,720
You know, again, sort of corollary to the dose response relationship.

121
00:12:25,500 --> 00:12:30,210
If it's a smaller spill versus like a huge spill, all these types of these are the types of things we can think about,

122
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:37,470
like how severely would the environment be impacted by a huge spill versus a small spill and what's the likelihood that each of those would occur?

123
00:12:38,370 --> 00:12:44,250
Yeah. So you can kind of see there's a variety of places like diverse settings where we can apply this approach.

124
00:12:45,390 --> 00:12:49,770
Anything else. Cool.

125
00:12:52,110 --> 00:12:56,820
So when we talk about risk in the setting of environmental health and toxicology,

126
00:12:57,630 --> 00:13:04,170
we're saying risk is the probability of an adverse outcome based on the exposure and potency of the hazardous agent.

127
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:12,210
So how potent of a toxicant is this chemical? How much of this chemical or what are the levels of exposure to this chemical?

128
00:13:12,420 --> 00:13:17,610
And how do those sort of taking those information, how both of those pieces of information,

129
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:24,000
how do we integrate those to understand what type of risk this poses for a somewhat exposed to that chemical?

130
00:13:25,170 --> 00:13:30,420
The hazard part references the intrinsic toxic properties of a chemical.

131
00:13:30,450 --> 00:13:35,760
So when we're talking about hazard in this instance, we're talking about something.

132
00:13:38,230 --> 00:13:42,550
You know, for example, say, does arsenic cause DNA damage?

133
00:13:43,240 --> 00:13:49,930
Does it does does a chemical bind to a hormone receptor?

134
00:13:50,590 --> 00:13:56,590
And is a hazard for that reason in terms of endocrine disruption when someone is exposed to that chemical.

135
00:13:57,010 --> 00:14:02,760
So the hazard really doesn't have anything to do with the exposure per say.

136
00:14:02,770 --> 00:14:09,190
It's about the chemical itself and what it could potentially do in order to damage a biological system.

137
00:14:12,420 --> 00:14:15,500
And so. Yeah.

138
00:14:15,510 --> 00:14:23,219
So a chemical could be very hazardous. But if someone is not exposed, if like just for, you know, theoretically,

139
00:14:23,220 --> 00:14:31,590
if the chemicals could be the most potent carcinogen in the world, but if it's only found in, you know, on the moon,

140
00:14:31,590 --> 00:14:35,520
for example, in a stored, safe box and no one is ever going to be exposed to it,

141
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:43,290
it doesn't present much of a risk in terms of exposure to, um, to most people in the population.

142
00:14:43,300 --> 00:14:48,330
Right. So without that exposure component, you don't really have a risk per say.

143
00:14:48,390 --> 00:14:49,530
Does that sort of make sense?

144
00:14:50,280 --> 00:14:57,629
So like the hazard is one thing, but an individual, if someone is not exposed to that hazard, then you're not going to really get a risk.

145
00:14:57,630 --> 00:15:08,100
You kind of need both of those parts of the equation. And so risk assessment requires integrating both quantitative so quantitative information.

146
00:15:08,700 --> 00:15:18,090
How much of this chemical are you, all the people in this town exposed to in terms of nanograms per liter in their blood, for example?

147
00:15:20,350 --> 00:15:24,550
And at what concentration in blood are we seeing adverse effects?

148
00:15:25,090 --> 00:15:28,830
That's the quantitative part that we need to bring in as well.

149
00:15:28,840 --> 00:15:36,010
So the more qualitative stuff is kind of on the hazard identification side of things, like what type of toxicant is this?

150
00:15:36,280 --> 00:15:43,809
What are the properties of it that would lead us to think it can cause damage in a biological system that we need to

151
00:15:43,810 --> 00:15:48,690
bring into quantification to understand if that's going to present a risk at the levels that people are exposed to.

152
00:15:54,780 --> 00:16:00,089
So yeah. So you have this overall qualitative evidence you've like characterized ideally like all the things that

153
00:16:00,090 --> 00:16:06,209
this chemical can sort of damage in the body and understand the sort of like risk that this poses for,

154
00:16:06,210 --> 00:16:11,430
say, causing cancer. And you integrate that with the quantitative exposure assessment.

155
00:16:12,270 --> 00:16:16,950
And you may want to factor in things like like whole susceptibility factors,

156
00:16:16,950 --> 00:16:23,580
like populations that may be more susceptible to the effects of this chemical, such as children or the elderly.

157
00:16:24,660 --> 00:16:27,810
And this is going to give you a sense of like the overall risk.

158
00:16:29,970 --> 00:16:31,770
In relation to exposure to this chemical.

159
00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:41,950
And so since with risk assessment, we're thinking about essentially we're thinking about the real world, right?

160
00:16:41,960 --> 00:16:51,320
And so there's going to be variability and there's going to be uncertainty that are kind of naturally part of our understanding of,

161
00:16:51,320 --> 00:16:56,600
say, an exposure scenario, right? So when we say variability,

162
00:16:56,930 --> 00:17:04,700
when we're talking about risk assessment or we're talking about is that if I take a population of people and say one particular town,

163
00:17:04,970 --> 00:17:10,580
there's going to be a variability in terms of their body weight, right?

164
00:17:10,670 --> 00:17:18,649
So there's just going to be natural variability. There's going to be an average and then a standard deviation or whatever type of statistics

165
00:17:18,650 --> 00:17:22,220
you want to crunch in terms of the body weight of the individuals in that town.

166
00:17:24,350 --> 00:17:28,190
That would that's what we call variability, uncertainty is.

167
00:17:30,530 --> 00:17:35,920
Something is a little bit different in terms of and kind of more broad.

168
00:17:35,980 --> 00:17:42,740
It's when we're talking about uncertainty, we're thinking about something like, ah, the levels of exposure that we're detecting.

169
00:17:43,460 --> 00:17:50,300
Or is our exposure evaluation really accounting for all the possible pathways of exposure for a particular chemical?

170
00:17:50,870 --> 00:18:00,829
So if we're accounting for exposure via food, but we're not accounting for that exposure via drinking water in our exposure model.

171
00:18:00,830 --> 00:18:03,620
And we just missed that, which you probably wouldn't miss that.

172
00:18:03,620 --> 00:18:10,760
But just for the sake of argument, if you were to leave that out of your bottle and you're the exposure is sort of not being well characterized,

173
00:18:11,300 --> 00:18:15,500
that would be sort of uncertainty or that would be a source of uncertainty.

174
00:18:15,500 --> 00:18:26,690
Or if you have a particular sort of instrument that's detecting levels of this chemical in the environment and there's for example,

175
00:18:26,690 --> 00:18:32,960
you're getting like a lot of non detects and you think it might be related to like the instrument not being sensitive enough.

176
00:18:33,140 --> 00:18:40,970
These types of things can be sources of uncertainty. So we recognize that that is an issue when we're conducting these risk assessments.

177
00:18:41,150 --> 00:18:48,230
Does that make sense? So you have like the inherent variability as well as uncertainties when you're trying to model exposures.

178
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:56,389
The EPA has some nice descriptions, just to remind you, you know, if you want to see this described in a couple of different ways.

179
00:18:56,390 --> 00:18:59,750
So like what is the difference between variability and uncertainty?

180
00:19:00,260 --> 00:19:08,930
Like variability cannot be reduced. Like there's always going to be variability related to things like, say, body weight amongst the populations.

181
00:19:09,890 --> 00:19:16,850
Uncertainty can be reduced if we get like a better instrument for measuring levels of this chemical in the water,

182
00:19:16,850 --> 00:19:21,200
for example, or we build better models of exposure.

183
00:19:21,800 --> 00:19:26,930
We can reduce uncertainty in that way that we think are like more accurate exposure modeling.

184
00:19:28,340 --> 00:19:32,000
So this is just like talking through some of those examples I just talked about in case you want to.

185
00:19:33,930 --> 00:19:37,130
This is just take it from directly from BP's website.

186
00:19:39,670 --> 00:19:44,650
This, the more attacks that I thought might be helpful to explain the differences there.

187
00:19:47,860 --> 00:19:51,970
So just take a pause and see if anyone has any comments or questions.

188
00:20:02,010 --> 00:20:12,920
Okay. So. When we're characterizing risk, we have to take into account these qualitative and quantitative analyzes.

189
00:20:13,610 --> 00:20:20,270
And this is, you know, we're including and kind of, you know, ideally being, like, transparent about the uncertainties that we have in our models.

190
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:24,319
We want to understand the mode of action of the toxicant.

191
00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:31,370
We want to know, like, why arsenic might be a problem in terms of carcinogenicity, is that damaging DNA, etc.?

192
00:20:33,260 --> 00:20:38,210
And, you know, what species are we seeing these affect or what types of effects are we expecting to see?

193
00:20:39,020 --> 00:20:46,480
You know, in terms of toxicology, we want to understand, like, what species of animals might be using for basing our risk assessments on these.

194
00:20:46,490 --> 00:20:54,710
There's a lot of a lot that goes into it. And then once we understand and characterize the risk, we bring it into the risk management phase.

195
00:20:55,670 --> 00:21:03,230
And this is kind of opening things up to a lot of other sort of fields are going to be kind of in follow up here.

196
00:21:03,260 --> 00:21:08,780
So the risk management is where sort of self explanatory the process by which policies are

197
00:21:08,780 --> 00:21:14,450
chosen to control this identified hazard like the risks presented by a particular hazard.

198
00:21:15,050 --> 00:21:18,710
And so in this case, you're going to be considering scientific evidence.

199
00:21:19,790 --> 00:21:27,490
You may be bringing in like other engineering controls that can help, like scrub this chemical out of the air in terms of air pollution,

200
00:21:27,500 --> 00:21:30,650
like out of a stack that we get a smokestack that we could, like implement.

201
00:21:31,750 --> 00:21:37,340
You're also going to be kind of. Having to take into account certain like economic aspects, right?

202
00:21:37,940 --> 00:21:41,479
And then social and political factors like this is where really the rubber hits the

203
00:21:41,480 --> 00:21:45,620
road and you're going to be kind of inner interfacing and interacting with a lot of

204
00:21:45,620 --> 00:21:50,870
different stakeholders that have an opinion or have some kind of stake in what the

205
00:21:50,870 --> 00:21:55,160
decision is in terms of the risk risk management approach you're deciding to take.

206
00:21:59,090 --> 00:22:06,830
And then we have risk communication where we want to communicate to the public,

207
00:22:08,340 --> 00:22:13,249
make risk assessment and risk management information understandable to all types of people,

208
00:22:13,250 --> 00:22:21,889
from community groups to lawyers, elected officials, business members of the business community, labor, environmentalists, etc.

209
00:22:21,890 --> 00:22:24,400
So this is where we're really kind of communicating, you know?

210
00:22:25,770 --> 00:22:33,210
The risk, what we know, what the scientific information tells us to a variety of stakeholders beyond just scientists.

211
00:22:33,490 --> 00:22:46,510
And that's not a not a super easy task, despite what some someone may say, like risk communication is like a like a whole field of study.

212
00:22:46,580 --> 00:22:51,299
Like what types of risk communication are effective versus not? We talked about this a little bit already.

213
00:22:51,300 --> 00:22:56,220
Do you remember that? One of the things we talked about in particular that was implemented.

214
00:22:59,310 --> 00:23:07,320
The Prop 65 thing in California. Right. And we talked about the the strengths and weaknesses of like labeling lots of stuff

215
00:23:07,890 --> 00:23:11,880
in California that people are going to be encountering as a potential carcinogen.

216
00:23:12,220 --> 00:23:21,060
Yeah. So it's that type of thing. So we had this ideal idea.

217
00:23:21,060 --> 00:23:24,270
Have you heard of the precautionary principle in regard to that?

218
00:23:24,630 --> 00:23:32,320
Yeah. So this idea here is a precautionary principle is when an activity raises threats of harm to the environment or human health.

219
00:23:32,340 --> 00:23:38,730
Precautionary measures should be taken even if some cause and effect relationships are not fully established scientifically.

220
00:23:39,480 --> 00:23:45,100
So this is from a public health standpoint, a very good idea.

221
00:23:45,120 --> 00:23:54,509
You know, you we like precaution in the public health world if we think that a chemical might be toxic

222
00:23:54,510 --> 00:24:00,899
in some way and but we don't have all the science there like kind of in an ideal situation,

223
00:24:00,900 --> 00:24:08,940
we will prevent exposures. It kind of makes sense. But in the real world, it's sort of hard to implement this.

224
00:24:08,940 --> 00:24:16,590
I mean, it depends kind of to some degree originally like you'll see like in Europe, there is more of a use of the precautionary principle.

225
00:24:17,010 --> 00:24:20,520
You may even look at like the levels of different states might take different approaches.

226
00:24:20,760 --> 00:24:28,469
Again, like Prop 65 is kind of coming at it from a precautionary principle standpoint in some ways, sort of.

227
00:24:28,470 --> 00:24:31,170
You could that's a little bit we could talk about that.

228
00:24:31,170 --> 00:24:39,930
But it's certainly coming from a general kind of a place of wanting to be cautious about exposures, which we don't have that here in Michigan.

229
00:24:41,070 --> 00:24:47,700
So the extent to which this principle is used sort of varies from case to case and region to region.

230
00:24:48,050 --> 00:24:51,870
Right. And, you know,

231
00:24:51,870 --> 00:25:01,499
I think it's sort of just an ongoing like active debate to some degree of like how we balance using the precautionary principle versus other factors.

232
00:25:01,500 --> 00:25:10,409
Like, you know, people could kind of point to like potential economic downsides in certain cases to being quote unquote, overly cautious.

233
00:25:10,410 --> 00:25:13,680
Right. Or using the precautionary principle. And you weigh those things.

234
00:25:14,670 --> 00:25:17,010
And yes, it's just sort of an active area of debate.

235
00:25:17,010 --> 00:25:24,959
But it was formalized at the swing spread conference back in 1998, which was this conference where a group of like scientists,

236
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:31,110
lawyers, policymakers, policymakers, etc., sort of like formally defined this precautionary principle.

237
00:25:31,860 --> 00:25:38,790
It was not like sort of invented there. It's been used and talked about in various ways for many years before that.

238
00:25:38,790 --> 00:25:41,910
But this is where it kind of like was formalized.

239
00:25:42,660 --> 00:25:51,190
Makes sense. So this is your risk management framework.

240
00:25:52,030 --> 00:25:55,990
So you have a problem with certain, you know, let's say, you know,

241
00:25:56,170 --> 00:26:03,610
there's a factory that's releasing air pollution in a town and your want to know what the health impacts might be.

242
00:26:03,970 --> 00:26:09,550
You understand the risks. Look through the options of ways to manage those risks.

243
00:26:10,780 --> 00:26:15,849
Make decisions about, you know, on which of those options you want to pursue.

244
00:26:15,850 --> 00:26:21,639
Take some kind of action and then evaluate did what we what we did.

245
00:26:21,640 --> 00:26:26,050
Our actions actually say like reduce exposures or improve health outcomes.

246
00:26:26,860 --> 00:26:36,100
And so we evaluate and the idea is that this would be iterative that we'd like then based on our evaluation process again, if need be.

247
00:26:36,910 --> 00:26:41,380
And throughout each of these processes, we want to be engaging the stakeholders,

248
00:26:41,710 --> 00:26:46,540
essentially talking to people who don't want to do this stuff in general, like in secret.

249
00:26:46,570 --> 00:26:54,250
You want to be transparent with the public and with whoever else is a stakeholder in this in this question.

250
00:27:00,980 --> 00:27:07,760
I don't know if anyone's heard of the red book. This is like one of the early, like, risk assessment attacks.

251
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:13,360
Um, this was the National Research Council published this book in 1983.

252
00:27:13,370 --> 00:27:16,420
Risk Assessment in the Federal Government. Managing the project.

253
00:27:16,790 --> 00:27:23,689
The Progress. It was kind of pulling together a lot of threads that had been in different places already in place,

254
00:27:23,690 --> 00:27:28,430
like risk evaluation as a whole predates like the publication of this book.

255
00:27:30,080 --> 00:27:33,320
But you had things like the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists,

256
00:27:34,010 --> 00:27:39,110
uh, establishing, you know, threshold limit values for certain occupational exposures.

257
00:27:39,620 --> 00:27:43,430
FDA was setting acceptable daily intakes for pesticide residues.

258
00:27:45,720 --> 00:27:52,490
A Delaney clause prohibiting the addition of substances that are cancer causing to food is there was a big one early on.

259
00:27:53,270 --> 00:28:03,679
You know, there was a lot of worry about cancer, you know, chemicals in the environment or, you know, in our food or etc., or causing cancer.

260
00:28:03,680 --> 00:28:06,560
So that was kind of a big concern early on.

261
00:28:06,860 --> 00:28:14,930
Since then, we've started to you're starting to see more things like concern about endpoints like, uh, for instance, endocrine disruption.

262
00:28:14,990 --> 00:28:21,650
It's like a big one that came out with like BPA. So we've kind of expanded our scope there in terms of what we're focusing on.

263
00:28:27,550 --> 00:28:38,470
So these are some of the toxic chemical laws in the U.S. and the agency, other responsible agency in the Congress, they were enacted.

264
00:28:38,470 --> 00:28:45,820
So like you have air pollution with like Clean Air Act 1970, water pollution, Federal Water Pollution Control Act on down.

265
00:28:45,820 --> 00:28:52,030
So if you have a particular area that you're interested in, you kind of see like which act covers,

266
00:28:52,210 --> 00:28:55,480
you know, say, toxic chemicals or hazardous waste or ocean dumping.

267
00:28:56,670 --> 00:29:00,270
Does anyone? I'm just curious. Does anyone in here do, like, ocean health or like.

268
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:13,360
That's so much. Some others like OSHA, workplace safety, of course, FDA, etc.

269
00:29:13,360 --> 00:29:21,070
So this gives you an example of the scope of like which agencies are overseeing which aspects of public health.

270
00:29:25,170 --> 00:29:27,809
So I've talked a lot about the risk assessment framework.

271
00:29:27,810 --> 00:29:34,740
I don't think I've actually put it up on a slide yet, but so the very basic risk assessment framework looks something like that.

272
00:29:34,760 --> 00:29:37,110
So you have, again, hazard identification.

273
00:29:37,740 --> 00:29:46,980
A lot of toxicologists work in this space, you know, where we're trying to understand what hazard a chemical, you know, poses.

274
00:29:47,700 --> 00:29:53,069
Does it damage DNA? Does it bind with certain hormone receptors?

275
00:29:53,070 --> 00:30:01,470
Does it is it a neurotoxin toxicant? What type of what's going on here in terms of the hazard, the intrinsic hazard presented by this chemical?

276
00:30:04,140 --> 00:30:08,820
And then we want to know how potent that response is. So that's where the dose response assessment comes in.

277
00:30:09,210 --> 00:30:12,690
So what's the relationship between the dose and the response?

278
00:30:14,710 --> 00:30:18,020
You know, are. In the are the people,

279
00:30:18,030 --> 00:30:22,950
the population of interest like is the concentrations that are the concentrations that we're seeing in their

280
00:30:22,950 --> 00:30:30,330
blood anywhere near the doses that are causing effects in our animal models or in our cell in vitro models.

281
00:30:30,930 --> 00:30:37,889
In terms of toxicology, you see a lot of animal work historically has been using like very high doses of chemicals,

282
00:30:37,890 --> 00:30:42,960
like 500 milligrams per kilogram of body weight, a thousand milligrams per kilogram of body weight,

283
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:50,490
which is like orders of magnitude higher for like a lot of chemicals in terms of the average person's level of exposure.

284
00:30:51,060 --> 00:30:54,420
And so that dose response component is super important to know,

285
00:30:54,420 --> 00:30:59,610
like what the potency of the response actually is in the relevant context that we're talking about.

286
00:31:02,230 --> 00:31:05,290
Along with the dose response. Do you want to do the exposure assessment?

287
00:31:05,380 --> 00:31:11,230
So what types and levels and duration of exposure are experienced or anticipated?

288
00:31:11,230 --> 00:31:15,560
So is this going to be chronic exposure? Is this a chemical we're talking about that's in someone's drinking water?

289
00:31:15,590 --> 00:31:22,990
People are going to be drinking water every day. Is it an occupational exposure where there's maybe like an eight hour timeframe

290
00:31:23,290 --> 00:31:26,730
where someone might potentially be coming into contact with this chemical?

291
00:31:26,740 --> 00:31:29,830
So you want to kind of characterize that exposure scenario.

292
00:31:32,050 --> 00:31:37,660
And you're going to kind of synthesize both of these pieces of information in order to characterize the risk.

293
00:31:38,470 --> 00:31:42,580
So what is the nature and estimated incidence of adverse effects in a given population?

294
00:31:42,880 --> 00:31:46,990
Based on what we know about the dose response and exposure assessment.

295
00:31:47,350 --> 00:31:55,329
How robust is the evidence? You'll see these EPA documents like talking about something like phthalates,

296
00:31:55,330 --> 00:32:01,150
where they're going through sort of systematically and looking at study after study and assessing

297
00:32:02,020 --> 00:32:10,299
individual studies for inclusion in terms of their like overall risk assessment of like a phthalate.

298
00:32:10,300 --> 00:32:17,080
And you'll see them talk about which studies they selected because the appropriate controls were in place.

299
00:32:17,600 --> 00:32:23,860
We think they've controlled control for all these important variables and we didn't use these because they didn't control for X, Y and Z.

300
00:32:24,310 --> 00:32:31,270
And so that so risk assessors are trying to get the most robust of the most like well done studies

301
00:32:31,410 --> 00:32:36,430
like this does the most robust set of evidence that they can in terms of making their decision,

302
00:32:37,660 --> 00:32:43,920
you know, bringing in this idea of uncertainty or variability, like how certain is the evaluation that we have?

303
00:32:43,930 --> 00:32:47,650
Like how confident do we feel in this answer that we're giving?

304
00:32:49,570 --> 00:32:56,530
Another important question to think about is are susceptible populations characterized often might not see this.

305
00:32:57,220 --> 00:33:06,820
I work in the field of female reproductive toxicology, focusing on pregnancy as a particular life event,

306
00:33:06,820 --> 00:33:15,700
and you don't see a ton of like risk assessments done like, you know, with a lot of discussion about pregnancy biology in that context.

307
00:33:15,910 --> 00:33:22,930
So what are some other susceptible populations that we should probably be thinking about when we do a risk assessment?

308
00:33:24,800 --> 00:33:28,080
Just any. Just any is fine. Children.

309
00:33:28,510 --> 00:33:36,280
Children. What's one we talked about in either food, toxicology or pesticide?

310
00:33:37,800 --> 00:33:41,040
We were talking about a pesticide exposure and there was like.

311
00:33:42,320 --> 00:33:45,500
A certain set of people that might be a little bit more.

312
00:33:46,070 --> 00:33:53,750
Workers seem to be workers. That's a good one. In this case, I was thinking about the polymorphisms in certain metabolic enzymes.

313
00:33:53,750 --> 00:34:01,250
So we know that there's some kind of polymorphism that leads to people sort of metabolizing a chemical, slower or less efficiently.

314
00:34:01,550 --> 00:34:11,430
That could be another population to consider when you're doing a risk assessment. So when we when we are talking, for example, of asbestos,

315
00:34:11,450 --> 00:34:17,419
we are the workers that are related with the work as best as they are the population of risks,

316
00:34:17,420 --> 00:34:27,920
but also their families, because sometimes they carry asbestos in their clothes and then then spray that in their homes.

317
00:34:28,460 --> 00:34:32,180
The take home pathway. Yeah, that's what I've heard it referred to.

318
00:34:32,510 --> 00:34:34,460
Some people refer to it as the take home pathway.

319
00:34:35,240 --> 00:34:43,400
You know, if it's if a pesticide is getting on the work clothes and that person gets in their vehicle to drive home,

320
00:34:43,610 --> 00:34:46,909
there could be a transfer into the dirt or dust within the vehicle.

321
00:34:46,910 --> 00:34:50,400
And then the kids get in that vehicle to go to school. You can have a train.

322
00:34:50,410 --> 00:34:52,610
You have an exposure via that route.

323
00:34:53,390 --> 00:35:02,480
A lot of this went into the chlorpyrifos ban in chlorpyrifos for a lot of uses was because of exposures that we knew

324
00:35:02,480 --> 00:35:09,440
or the effects that we were seeing in with children that were exposed in terms of neurodevelopmental outcomes.

325
00:35:10,760 --> 00:35:13,909
Yeah. So yeah.

326
00:35:13,910 --> 00:35:18,110
And is there a relevant mode of action? You know, we we look for like coherence.

327
00:35:18,440 --> 00:35:27,139
You know, if a chemical is causes DNA damage and appears to be associated with like cancer in epidemiology studies,

328
00:35:27,140 --> 00:35:33,560
that's like a pretty good relevant mode of action of that chemical for why it would be causing cancer.

329
00:35:35,710 --> 00:35:45,550
If something if we if we're seeing a lot of like. I don't know, impacts on things that things that might suggest chemicals and endocrine disruptor,

330
00:35:45,550 --> 00:35:50,060
but we haven't identified a particular mechanism by which that occurs.

331
00:35:50,170 --> 00:35:55,209
We don't know if it binds to any of the hormone receptors or all other hormone levels seem

332
00:35:55,210 --> 00:36:00,830
to be the same in people that are exposed to the chemical that that might be a mystery.

333
00:36:00,860 --> 00:36:07,720
We want to find out like why? Like what exactly is going on there so we can have a better picture of the overall.

334
00:36:09,470 --> 00:36:12,680
You know, we can characterize the risk better in that case.

335
00:36:13,040 --> 00:36:18,250
So motive, action is important. A quick question on the susceptible populations piece.

336
00:36:18,260 --> 00:36:19,129
I was just wondering if, you know,

337
00:36:19,130 --> 00:36:25,580
if like environmental justice communities are ever considered as a susceptible population since they already are burdened with higher exposures?

338
00:36:25,970 --> 00:36:33,270
That's a good question. I think. I think they're trying is my sense.

339
00:36:33,480 --> 00:36:38,410
I talk to people at EPA that talk about how this all this is done.

340
00:36:38,430 --> 00:36:44,190
You know, there's a lot of questions of like so some people live in communities that are kind of

341
00:36:44,220 --> 00:36:50,820
overburdened already with like air pollution and maybe a couple other things like lead paint or,

342
00:36:51,030 --> 00:36:52,290
you know, what, what have you.

343
00:36:52,620 --> 00:37:01,709
How do you take all of that and do a risk assessment like the overall burden of all of that together is kind of hard because with a risk assessment,

344
00:37:01,710 --> 00:37:06,030
we want to have like one particular endpoint. What is the risk for?

345
00:37:07,150 --> 00:37:13,000
Cancer given exposure to this chemical. And obviously, like real life is not that simple.

346
00:37:13,690 --> 00:37:18,420
And I think the best answer I can give to that right now is that they're working on it.

347
00:37:18,430 --> 00:37:25,270
And, you know, I've talked to several people that have talked about, like the difficulties of like characterizing the overall environmental burden.

348
00:37:25,270 --> 00:37:33,940
But I would say probably not to the extent that we would really like to be like fully protective of public health at this point.

349
00:37:35,410 --> 00:37:40,030
There's certainly like certain situations where, you know, you may define a certain community,

350
00:37:40,300 --> 00:37:47,490
like a tribal community, for example, that is has a certain dietary component.

351
00:37:47,500 --> 00:37:52,180
Like, I believe my Ph.D. advisor, Lillian Foulston,

352
00:37:53,050 --> 00:37:56,800
did a lot of work in terms of like certain tribal populations that were consuming a

353
00:37:56,800 --> 00:38:02,080
lot of fish in like the North Pacific Northwest that was contaminated with like,

354
00:38:02,080 --> 00:38:06,070
you know, we know that seafood gets contaminated, like mercury and other things.

355
00:38:06,460 --> 00:38:16,030
And kind of understanding that particular kind of specific risk scenario versus like the broader population.

356
00:38:16,390 --> 00:38:21,400
So there are efforts to do that. But I would say we still have a long ways to go would be my answer.

357
00:38:24,410 --> 00:38:30,470
Any other questions? Well, thanks.

358
00:38:31,280 --> 00:38:35,360
Good conversation. See here, this is in your textbook.

359
00:38:35,600 --> 00:38:38,990
This is, like, kind of fleshes this out a little bit more.

360
00:38:41,430 --> 00:38:46,930
So like a lot of us in toxicology, I like working in this space.

361
00:38:46,950 --> 00:38:56,700
We're doing the research laboratory, field research, evaluating exposures and populations and figuring out the observed adverse health effects,

362
00:38:56,700 --> 00:39:02,069
understanding the mechanisms of toxicity which we've had a full semester now of,

363
00:39:02,070 --> 00:39:04,950
like talking about different mechanisms of toxicity,

364
00:39:05,460 --> 00:39:11,070
kind of integrating this new field of genomics and understanding how that overlays with exposures to toxicants.

365
00:39:11,070 --> 00:39:19,770
Right? And so in the risk assessment, we might put in the risk assessment and that has an ID space.

366
00:39:20,520 --> 00:39:23,579
We're going to be pulling in things that we've sort of talked about throughout the course,

367
00:39:23,580 --> 00:39:27,740
like things like in-vitro tests, like in vitro models of like neurons.

368
00:39:27,750 --> 00:39:32,280
And in addition, we add a pesticide to that and see how it affects the behavior of the neurons.

369
00:39:33,030 --> 00:39:42,960
Animal bio assays, right? We give rats or mice this chemical and we can understand if this is a hazard in terms of, again, carcinogenesis.

370
00:39:44,380 --> 00:39:50,740
We talked about epidemiology studies, which we haven't talked. We haven't talked about epidemiology studies so much in this course so far.

371
00:39:50,740 --> 00:39:55,040
But we'll talk a little bit more about that later. And then, of course, dose response.

372
00:39:55,040 --> 00:39:57,950
You know, any good toxicology studies are going to include the dose response.

373
00:39:58,550 --> 00:40:04,120
And then again, we want to understand how susceptibility might modify that dose response curve.

374
00:40:04,130 --> 00:40:14,270
I think in the air pollution study, we heard the lecture, we talked about how for someone with an underlying like like cardiovascular,

375
00:40:14,270 --> 00:40:17,960
pulmonary, cardiopulmonary condition that like the risk,

376
00:40:18,010 --> 00:40:23,089
essentially the curve can be shifted such that they're more susceptible and seeing health

377
00:40:23,090 --> 00:40:27,350
effects at lower levels of air pollution than someone without that underlying condition.

378
00:40:29,170 --> 00:40:30,670
Gene environment interactions.

379
00:40:30,670 --> 00:40:37,270
We talked about chlorpyrifos and how some people have a polymorphism that doesn't allow them to metabolize polymorphism,

380
00:40:37,930 --> 00:40:45,160
metabolize chlorpyrifos as efficiently compared to the rest of the population.

381
00:40:46,750 --> 00:40:51,730
So yeah. And so again, this is risk assessment. This is all fed into the risk characterization.

382
00:40:52,940 --> 00:40:58,670
Exposure assessment. Yeah, it goes. So you take all of these three and feed this into the risk characterization,

383
00:40:59,390 --> 00:41:05,690
which is going to lead to the development of like your actions, like how are you going to manage the risk?

384
00:41:06,110 --> 00:41:12,890
And this is, again, where you're bringing in these other fields legal, political, community activists,

385
00:41:13,430 --> 00:41:19,430
what have you really kind of opens it up to the broader public when we get to this stage, more or less.

386
00:41:19,460 --> 00:41:24,650
You know, you could argue that in some cases the broader community doesn't have as much of a voice as they should.

387
00:41:25,100 --> 00:41:28,310
But this is kind of the space that we're at with the risk management level.

388
00:41:32,760 --> 00:41:39,150
Yeah. So the risk management strategies are reached under a diverse set of statutes, both in the US and globally.

389
00:41:40,950 --> 00:41:47,219
So this provides a framework for it, a priority setting done by regulatory agencies, chemical companies,

390
00:41:47,220 --> 00:41:52,680
and how do we allocate resources to mitigate harmful effects due to chemical exposures?

391
00:41:54,320 --> 00:41:57,890
So like different statutes are going to rely on, say, risk alone.

392
00:41:58,340 --> 00:42:06,920
Others might mandate that you need to talk about and balance the risks and benefits of a product or activity.

393
00:42:06,950 --> 00:42:13,700
So what are the risks of manufacturing this product versus the benefits of that this product provides?

394
00:42:13,930 --> 00:42:16,820
You know, most things are manufactured for a reason.

395
00:42:16,970 --> 00:42:23,300
A good example might be the phthalates used in manufacturing products that are used in the hospital.

396
00:42:23,330 --> 00:42:27,709
Right. For intubation and kidney dialysis.

397
00:42:27,710 --> 00:42:30,890
The families that we use that are found in those products.

398
00:42:31,880 --> 00:42:38,120
That part like important properties to these hospital like hospital equipment.

399
00:42:38,120 --> 00:42:45,469
And so there is like a societal benefit there. Right. It's not that phthalates are just made just to be toxic out in the environment.

400
00:42:45,470 --> 00:42:51,650
They offer a societal benefit. So there's a lot of cases where we need to be thinking about both costs and benefits there.

401
00:42:55,680 --> 00:43:01,320
So we can think about the objectives of risk assessment, again, which you talked about with that quote before.

402
00:43:01,830 --> 00:43:04,800
But the idea is that we want to protect you in an ecological health. Right.

403
00:43:05,340 --> 00:43:13,140
Nice ideal from toxic substances in the cases of, you know, this environmental toxicology situation.

404
00:43:13,440 --> 00:43:15,160
Again, balancing risks and benefits.

405
00:43:15,180 --> 00:43:23,069
Again, going you know, other examples include things like drugs, medications that people, you know, lifesaving medications.

406
00:43:23,070 --> 00:43:27,479
In some cases, we need to balance the costs and benefits of manufacturing those.

407
00:43:27,480 --> 00:43:31,230
And, again, pesticides as well. You know, we all eat food.

408
00:43:31,920 --> 00:43:36,870
Pesticides are helped of, you know, in food production.

409
00:43:36,870 --> 00:43:41,579
And so there is a cost benefit there. And we want to set target levels of risk.

410
00:43:41,580 --> 00:43:48,690
So like what food contaminants are acceptable levels of food contaminants might be acceptable or what food additives are acceptable?

411
00:43:49,020 --> 00:43:56,450
What levels of water pollutants? We talked about the criteria, air pollutants that need to be kept under a certain threshold or should be.

412
00:43:56,460 --> 00:44:00,360
And we saw how some states are out of compliance on some of those or some counties, I think.

413
00:44:02,320 --> 00:44:07,840
Yeah. And that we need to set priorities, priorities like we can't do everything, unfortunately.

414
00:44:07,840 --> 00:44:14,350
So there's a certain set of like prioritization that needs to happen that's kind of set by regulatory agencies,

415
00:44:14,710 --> 00:44:18,460
manufacturers or like environmental or consumer organizations.

416
00:44:20,140 --> 00:44:28,990
And again, this iterative thing where we're going to estimate how successful we were in reducing risk or improving public health,

417
00:44:30,820 --> 00:44:35,980
and then maybe have to maybe we have to go back to the drawing board and figure out a way to reduce exposures even further.

418
00:44:39,250 --> 00:44:48,070
Any thoughts? I guess I'm just wondering, what is the framework like within communities of risk assessment?

419
00:44:48,080 --> 00:44:51,770
Like does each occupation have someone that's doing this?

420
00:44:51,770 --> 00:44:56,630
Or like does each community have this like running risk assessment?

421
00:44:58,130 --> 00:45:05,240
Like, I know they test for like chemicals and water in every community, but I just wonder for like new exposures that might go on.

422
00:45:07,130 --> 00:45:14,690
Yeah. I mean, I think it's just really going to be dependent on who has the jurisdiction over a particular situation.

423
00:45:14,690 --> 00:45:19,610
If it's like exposure on the job, it's going to be, you know, under OSHA.

424
00:45:20,360 --> 00:45:23,209
Um, yeah, I think it's just a lot of it.

425
00:45:23,210 --> 00:45:29,110
EPA is going to be looking at more, you know, like air pollution and like big scale exposures and things like that.

426
00:45:29,120 --> 00:45:32,390
FDA So like that was you showed earlier. I remember it now.

427
00:45:32,400 --> 00:45:40,549
Yeah, yeah, yeah. So I, I think, but yeah, there's certainly going to be like it's sort of if you go to like say if you've

428
00:45:40,550 --> 00:45:45,110
ever been to like a community discussion about I remember I lived in Kalamazoo,

429
00:45:47,600 --> 00:45:52,850
there was a big thing with PCBs in the Kalamazoo River at the time, and there was a big discussion on campus,

430
00:45:52,850 --> 00:45:56,209
like a big three invited everyone from like like everyone was free to show up.

431
00:45:56,210 --> 00:46:06,350
Right. And the people speaking were like academics, people from EPA, local officials, and, you know, who's overseeing that whole project?

432
00:46:06,350 --> 00:46:12,500
Like, it's probably gonna go back to, like, the federal level for something like that, like whether it's like designated a Superfund site or not.

433
00:46:13,580 --> 00:46:20,810
But in terms of like input, again, I guess this is getting off the air, of course, in terms of talking about a risk assessment per say.

434
00:46:21,020 --> 00:46:29,060
But long story short, what I was trying to say is it becomes sort of a tangle of, you know, in different conditions.

435
00:46:29,480 --> 00:46:33,740
You know, you may have different sort of levels of authority in terms of.

436
00:46:35,800 --> 00:46:39,430
Whether how risk assessment is done or.

437
00:46:39,820 --> 00:46:47,920
Yeah, it gets. Yeah, it's complicated to some degree but you know, risk assessments like proper like to do a full risk assessment.

438
00:46:47,920 --> 00:46:56,139
It's very expensive and requires a lot of resources. So really what we're talking about to do a risk assessment like from start to finish is something

439
00:46:56,140 --> 00:47:02,980
like EPA is going to be doing that or like a risk assessment like consulting firm in some cases,

440
00:47:02,980 --> 00:47:06,520
you know. Yes, different entities will play a role.

441
00:47:06,920 --> 00:47:09,290
I think there's. Yeah.

442
00:47:09,300 --> 00:47:15,530
I mean, but at the local level, like, say, Michigan, the state of Michigan might do like their own risk assessment for certain cases.

443
00:47:15,530 --> 00:47:22,940
But yeah, it really is going to kind of ping back to like who is overseeing that particular like contaminated site, for example.

444
00:47:23,250 --> 00:47:28,070
That makes sense. It becomes a very like complicated legal.

445
00:47:30,060 --> 00:47:33,170
Framework there until I get. Anything else.

446
00:47:36,530 --> 00:47:42,450
Right. So risk assessment is like interdisciplinary.

447
00:47:42,720 --> 00:47:47,790
We're pulling together from multiple places in order to do this.

448
00:47:49,050 --> 00:47:52,410
So, you know, toxicologists might be the ones, you know,

449
00:47:52,500 --> 00:47:57,660
demonstrating the biological plausibility and the clinical significance for a chemical exposure.

450
00:47:58,440 --> 00:48:05,940
Exposure. Scientists are going to be the ones that are going to measure the exposure and tell us how much of the stuff are people exposed to?

451
00:48:06,450 --> 00:48:10,620
How much are we finding in the blood? How much are we seeing in the urine? And that's not a trivial thing.

452
00:48:11,460 --> 00:48:15,760
I work closely with exposure scientists, and I'm always impressed by, like,

453
00:48:16,050 --> 00:48:21,720
what they're able to do in recruiting individuals for, like, human subjects, studies and things.

454
00:48:22,470 --> 00:48:26,520
It's definitely a kind of, you know,

455
00:48:26,550 --> 00:48:33,540
I'm happy to collaborate because I do not understand all of the mathematical modeling that goes into a lot of these models and stuff.

456
00:48:33,900 --> 00:48:37,170
So I definitely need exposure scientists.

457
00:48:38,160 --> 00:48:41,850
And then there's like a social and behavioral, you know, science that can be brought to this,

458
00:48:41,850 --> 00:48:50,579
like characterizing how individuals are going to be behaving like I'm thinking of in terms of exposure again to phthalates.

459
00:48:50,580 --> 00:48:55,739
There's a lot of documentation looking into how, for instance,

460
00:48:55,740 --> 00:49:03,620
like something like how infants behave in terms of their exposure to plasticizers that might be infant toys.

461
00:49:03,630 --> 00:49:09,060
How often are they like putting these toys in their mouths? And there's like people that like characterize this and like written studies in

462
00:49:09,060 --> 00:49:15,180
terms of how often infants are having like mouth to hand-to-mouth activity.

463
00:49:15,390 --> 00:49:23,760
And that is something you do to really understand the exposure levels that there is like a residue of a chemical in an

464
00:49:23,760 --> 00:49:27,990
infant's home and you know that they're going to be like crawling on the floor and then putting their hands in their mouth.

465
00:49:28,380 --> 00:49:32,340
You need to understand that. I mean, that kind of goes under the exposure side of things,

466
00:49:32,340 --> 00:49:37,350
but also behavior is important as well to understand, you know, what people are doing in their day to day lives.

467
00:49:40,050 --> 00:49:44,220
And then this communication, you know, a lot of different parties are going to be involved in this.

468
00:49:44,550 --> 00:49:48,990
Again, the legal, legal aspects, etc.

469
00:49:48,990 --> 00:49:52,200
So long story short.

470
00:49:52,440 --> 00:49:59,190
Risk assessment is very interdisciplinary. Making it very challenging.

471
00:50:00,720 --> 00:50:05,960
So. Back to a place where I feel a little bit more comfortable.

472
00:50:06,470 --> 00:50:14,690
Hazard identification. So this is kind of where, you know, we can bring a lot of our toxicology knowledge into this space.

473
00:50:17,110 --> 00:50:24,549
There's a lot of there's multiple different types of toxicology studies that could help us in identifying hazards posed by a chemical.

474
00:50:24,550 --> 00:50:29,110
So one of those I've talked a little bit about is the structure, activity, relationships.

475
00:50:29,530 --> 00:50:30,549
And that's where we're again,

476
00:50:30,550 --> 00:50:37,900
we're we're analyzing the structure of the molecular structure of a chemical and comparing it to other known chemicals to say,

477
00:50:37,900 --> 00:50:45,100
hey, this might be a flag for endocrine disruption or carcinogenesis.

478
00:50:46,460 --> 00:50:51,110
And then we have our in vitro models of cells or tissues that we use,

479
00:50:51,950 --> 00:50:57,890
short term assays that we've talked about, some of these like the common assay animal bio assays.

480
00:50:58,280 --> 00:51:04,100
So we talk a lot about those. And then epidemiology can also play a role.

481
00:51:06,560 --> 00:51:10,670
And so just an important thing to remember is that in the grand scheme of things,

482
00:51:10,670 --> 00:51:15,200
there's a lot we don't know about the chemicals that are released into the environment and are out there.

483
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:24,790
We just don't have all the data in terms of all the biological systems that could potentially be perturbed by a particular toxic.

484
00:51:24,800 --> 00:51:29,750
We just don't have all of that super well-characterized for a lot of the vast majority

485
00:51:29,750 --> 00:51:34,610
of chemicals that are released into the environment that we come in contact with.

486
00:51:37,020 --> 00:51:40,350
Here's a little bit more on structure, activity, relationships.

487
00:51:40,620 --> 00:51:42,570
So this is something where we might.

488
00:51:43,980 --> 00:51:53,220
Use this process to sort of if we haven't forgiven like a group of chemicals and we say we can only do like a full risk assessment on 25 of these 50,

489
00:51:53,640 --> 00:51:56,070
you might go through and do a structure activity,

490
00:51:56,310 --> 00:52:03,090
relationship type of analysis in order to prioritize which of those 25 you want to follow up on for more study.

491
00:52:04,170 --> 00:52:09,569
So what are you going to do here is integrate information on the chemical structure, its solubility,

492
00:52:09,570 --> 00:52:14,610
like how it's going to behave in the environment based on like how we know chemicals with certain functional groups,

493
00:52:14,610 --> 00:52:20,010
etc. might behave in the environment, what it how it's going to operate at different patches,

494
00:52:20,430 --> 00:52:27,770
electoral felicity volatility, does it get volatiles into the air, etc.

495
00:52:27,780 --> 00:52:32,189
So all of that is going to and this involves a lot of like chemistry knowledge,

496
00:52:32,190 --> 00:52:37,650
biology, novel knowledge and like really involved like statistical modeling.

497
00:52:38,520 --> 00:52:41,220
It's all of that can be used to bring to bear.

498
00:52:41,550 --> 00:52:49,410
And we're really like pushing this field forward with things like machine learning to kind of automate this,

499
00:52:50,160 --> 00:52:56,130
to make it a little bit more feasible, to analyze more chemicals in a shorter time period.

500
00:53:00,440 --> 00:53:08,389
Yeah. Let's see. Oh, and this is, like, particularly helpful if we have, like, a complex mixture of, say, structurally related compounds, like,

501
00:53:08,390 --> 00:53:17,060
let's say we have a mix of different PCBs that are all kind of in the same chemical family but have slightly different, like molecular structures.

502
00:53:17,060 --> 00:53:24,320
We could go through and like analyze that mixture and say like, let's say there's five PCBs in a particular chemical mixture.

503
00:53:24,320 --> 00:53:31,549
We can say these two are like red flags for DNA, damaging chemicals, like they have this functional group.

504
00:53:31,550 --> 00:53:36,920
That means they're probably we would have allies that start like being very reactive after they're metabolized.

505
00:53:36,920 --> 00:53:43,430
And these other three, they're probably not so much. So then you could prioritize those two out of that mixture for further analysis.

506
00:53:46,950 --> 00:53:51,230
And this is the type of thing that would be used in like pharmaceutical industry to design a better drug.

507
00:53:51,240 --> 00:54:00,000
Right. You can imagine if you're trying to design a chemical with like maximum therapeutic benefit versus not very much like toxicity,

508
00:54:00,010 --> 00:54:06,000
like a high therapeutic index. This type of approach is going to be really helpful.

509
00:54:10,030 --> 00:54:16,330
It's still difficult to predict activity across chemical classes and like kind of identify

510
00:54:17,350 --> 00:54:21,790
all the different like potential toxic end points just based on structure though.

511
00:54:22,510 --> 00:54:31,060
So there are limitations here. And then in the field of like environmental toxicology as opposed to like drug development,

512
00:54:32,410 --> 00:54:35,530
we see like four pollutants that were that are out in the environment.

513
00:54:35,920 --> 00:54:44,020
It's relatively rare to have like one specific like this chemical binds to this receptor and causes this effect.

514
00:54:45,130 --> 00:54:51,670
Most chemicals have like a variety impact of a variety of like biological pathways.

515
00:54:51,670 --> 00:54:55,270
Right. Could it could have effects on multiple tissues that we need to sort of consider.

516
00:54:56,200 --> 00:55:04,389
The sort of targeting is not really as much of an issue or not not present in terms of like understanding how

517
00:55:04,390 --> 00:55:11,300
pollutants might affect biological systems versus like a designed drug that's like targeted for one specific receptor.

518
00:55:11,320 --> 00:55:15,580
Right. Seems pretty. Intuitive for the most part.

519
00:55:16,990 --> 00:55:21,070
We'll take a quick break and see if anyone has any. Thoughts.

520
00:55:21,550 --> 00:55:27,600
Questions. Comments. I go too fast.

521
00:55:32,070 --> 00:55:39,700
Cool. So we talked about some of these like in vitro and short term tests.

522
00:55:39,820 --> 00:55:46,040
So typically in this case, we might be looking at things like, say, DNA damage.

523
00:55:46,040 --> 00:55:53,080
So we have a common assay where we can just like essentially plop a chemical down and see if it's like breaking apart DNA in a cell,

524
00:55:53,440 --> 00:55:55,000
which we can pick up pretty easy.

525
00:55:56,920 --> 00:56:06,670
You know, we could, like, expose pregnant animals to a chemical and like, see if we're seeing, like, birth defects in the litter after exposure.

526
00:56:07,240 --> 00:56:11,020
Are we can we see if a cat is an animal? So, yeah, so sorry.

527
00:56:11,020 --> 00:56:19,050
This is in vitro and short term test. So tests that we could do within, you know, I would say like six months or less,

528
00:56:19,060 --> 00:56:26,620
maybe we could, you know, feed a chemical to animals and see if they're able to reproduce.

529
00:56:26,620 --> 00:56:30,550
Are they are they producing viable offspring after they're after mating and stuff?

530
00:56:31,270 --> 00:56:36,490
So kind of like overt neurotoxic effects might be picked up as well as like certain immuno toxicological.

531
00:56:36,730 --> 00:56:44,440
Now we can draw blood and see if certain impacts on like circulating immune cells might be affected by a chemical.

532
00:56:44,470 --> 00:56:48,280
Right. So we could do those like pretty some of those like pretty short term.

533
00:56:51,910 --> 00:56:59,890
So in vitro alternatives to animal testing, there's been this big push for ethical reasons and cost saving reasons of like

534
00:56:59,920 --> 00:57:04,840
getting away from the animal testing of using so many animals for toxicology.

535
00:57:06,370 --> 00:57:15,220
However, what you are going to replace like an animal or replace an animal with some kind of in-vitro test like we're not going to do,

536
00:57:17,080 --> 00:57:20,260
let's say this particular neurotoxicity tests anymore.

537
00:57:20,440 --> 00:57:26,589
We're going to use this like in vitro model where we take like neuronal stem cells and treat them with a chemical.

538
00:57:26,590 --> 00:57:29,710
And that's going to be our proxy for neurotoxic effects.

539
00:57:30,280 --> 00:57:34,089
These like and there's like all flavors of these for all, any type of end point,

540
00:57:34,090 --> 00:57:40,810
you see people putting forth ideas of publishing papers on like proposed alternatives using an in vitro system.

541
00:57:42,070 --> 00:57:50,680
But the ones that have been sort of validated by the regulatory agencies are pretty few and far between because you want it to be,

542
00:57:50,680 --> 00:57:58,000
like, super accurate. Like, if it's going to replace a living animal, you're going to need it to be like replicating that in vivo system.

543
00:57:58,240 --> 00:58:03,670
Like, super, super. Well. And so that's why things are picking up.

544
00:58:03,910 --> 00:58:09,100
And like, you know, this is an area of research that I'm really interested in is like developing new models for

545
00:58:09,100 --> 00:58:14,710
understanding female reproductive toxicity that might not involve the use of animal models.

546
00:58:15,610 --> 00:58:25,240
But again, it's kind of been a grind to get these approved for use and not, you know, for good reason because we want them to be, like, accurate.

547
00:58:27,470 --> 00:58:30,500
In vitro models can provide information about the mechanism, again,

548
00:58:30,530 --> 00:58:34,720
like understanding the mode of action of a chemical and they're fast and inexpensive.

549
00:58:34,730 --> 00:58:47,750
So that's always nice. So one thing we need to do, you may have encountered this in some other part of your honor,

550
00:58:48,050 --> 00:58:55,010
in one of your other classes, is that you talked about determining a test sensitivity and specificity.

551
00:58:55,790 --> 00:59:03,590
You talked about the. Okay, so this will be like a review, right? So if we're want to replace a in-vivo system with an in vitro model,

552
00:59:03,950 --> 00:59:09,050
we're going to want to know what the sensitivity and specificity for detecting

553
00:59:09,200 --> 00:59:13,670
reproductive toxicants is for that in vitro model and compare it to the approval model.

554
00:59:16,410 --> 00:59:20,370
So this is like we want to minimize, like, false positives and false negatives.

555
00:59:20,550 --> 00:59:23,320
Right. The idea here.

556
00:59:23,320 --> 00:59:31,150
And just for anyone who might not be super familiar, the sensitivity and specificity is because I just like two ways of understanding.

557
00:59:32,820 --> 00:59:38,550
The number of like false. So you'll have like imagine you have a group of chemicals.

558
00:59:38,940 --> 00:59:43,890
Some of them are known to be reproductive toxicants and some are known to not be reproductive toxicants.

559
00:59:44,430 --> 00:59:54,960
And the idea is that you're in vitro test would basically categorize all of the reproductive toxicants correctly and then, uh, yeah,

560
00:59:55,170 --> 01:00:04,920
you know, basically categorize the chemicals correctly if your test is picking up a chemical that is a reproductive toxicant.

561
01:00:08,080 --> 01:00:12,860
And it's not that would be like the false positive or the converse being like false negative.

562
01:00:12,880 --> 01:00:22,150
Right. So. The sensitivity is measuring your ability to correctly understand a false or predict a true positive.

563
01:00:22,150 --> 01:00:30,070
And the specificity is a measure of understanding how many truly negative

564
01:00:30,220 --> 01:00:35,410
reproductive toxicants your test is categorizing as not a reproductive toxicant.

565
01:00:37,690 --> 01:00:50,050
Okay, so but for the time being, we have animal bio assays for a lot of our work still in toxicology testing.

566
01:00:50,380 --> 01:00:55,390
This is like historically what's been used as animals, rats, mice, etc.

567
01:00:57,520 --> 01:01:04,030
The idea kind of historically is that chemicals that cause cancer in animals can cause cancer in people, which,

568
01:01:04,600 --> 01:01:10,810
you know, there's enough sort of overlap there in our biologies for that to make basic sort of scientific sense.

569
01:01:13,010 --> 01:01:15,800
It's all chemicals that are known to cause cancer in people.

570
01:01:16,190 --> 01:01:22,490
We found it do cause cancer in at least one of the animal models we've tested, whether that's rats, mice, rabbits.

571
01:01:23,870 --> 01:01:31,430
However, the reverse isn't necessarily true so far. If a chemical causes cancer in rabbits, it doesn't necessarily cause cancer in people.

572
01:01:35,810 --> 01:01:40,070
Again, this is where we kind of start to think about again, like the precautionary principle.

573
01:01:42,830 --> 01:01:48,170
The so the precautionary principle would tell us that if a chemical has a suspected risk of

574
01:01:48,170 --> 01:01:52,579
harming the public our environment in the absence of some type of scientific consensus,

575
01:01:52,580 --> 01:01:58,310
the burden of proof would fall on showing that it is not that that chemical is not harmful, which,

576
01:01:58,850 --> 01:02:02,990
you know, the argument back to that is like you're trying to kind of in some ways prove a negative.

577
01:02:04,340 --> 01:02:08,030
So that can be kind of challenging to kind of navigate that.

578
01:02:09,710 --> 01:02:13,760
But certainly, again, from the standpoint of like wanting to protect public health.

579
01:02:14,690 --> 01:02:21,920
The precautionary principle looks like a pretty attractive way to present a view of these issues to some extent.

580
01:02:23,480 --> 01:02:28,180
If anyone has any thoughts, you know, there's different ways you can think about this. You know, think.

581
01:02:29,960 --> 01:02:35,080
Feel free to comment. Okay.

582
01:02:35,650 --> 01:02:43,600
So when we talk about like using what are the main ways of using animal bio bio assays is to detect potential carcinogens.

583
01:02:44,500 --> 01:02:51,130
And so these are some of the features that we would use for like a really proper animal bio assay for Carcinogenesis.

584
01:02:51,910 --> 01:03:00,970
So you'd want to test at least two species. So like mice and rats, both sexes, at least like 50 animals per group.

585
01:03:01,750 --> 01:03:04,720
And we want near lifetime exposure.

586
01:03:05,170 --> 01:03:10,600
So this is a big difference compared to what I was talking about on the earlier slide about like the short term bio assets.

587
01:03:10,930 --> 01:03:16,330
This is like long term exposure to this chemical over the lifetime already causing cancer.

588
01:03:17,620 --> 01:03:23,020
And there's a lot of important choices to make before you embark on this type of study.

589
01:03:23,030 --> 01:03:29,020
Right. You know, what strain of animals are you going to use as different rat strains?

590
01:03:29,650 --> 01:03:33,010
I would say there is biological differences between them.

591
01:03:35,350 --> 01:03:38,470
What's your dose response going to look like? How many doses are you going to test?

592
01:03:38,590 --> 01:03:44,440
You're going to test. You can't test infinite doses. Right. So you're going to have to think about the increments of your dose response.

593
01:03:44,800 --> 01:03:53,590
What's your dose response curve going to look if you test them all way to low like really low levels of a chemical,

594
01:03:53,710 --> 01:04:00,250
like, I'm not going to go anything above what, you know, the medium exposure and like the, you know,

595
01:04:00,460 --> 01:04:07,210
the US population is you may not pick up any cancers if you're just kind of sitting at that low exposure.

596
01:04:07,300 --> 01:04:13,440
So you might not be, you know, having much to assess. If you go too high, then, you know,

597
01:04:13,450 --> 01:04:20,110
you're kind of in the area where the exposure to this chemical is like not super relevant for extrapolating to human exposure.

598
01:04:20,140 --> 01:04:25,480
So you'd really like to see that dynamic response where at low levels you're seeing kind of

599
01:04:25,480 --> 01:04:30,010
either little to no effect and then at higher levels you're starting to see an effect in.

600
01:04:30,010 --> 01:04:35,440
I've personally encountered this not with cancer bio assays but with different types of assays where you have

601
01:04:35,440 --> 01:04:40,060
to kind of do a preliminary study sometimes to kind of understand what your curve is going to look like.

602
01:04:41,650 --> 01:04:44,770
If, you know, I've done you get, you know,

603
01:04:44,770 --> 01:04:53,710
it's kind of sad sometimes when you're doing like like a study and like your curve looks easier like like this,

604
01:04:54,070 --> 01:04:58,240
but it's like this is zero and then every one of your doses is causing like maximal,

605
01:04:58,570 --> 01:05:08,590
maximal response in your assay or like, uh, this where like most of your doses are not doing much.

606
01:05:08,590 --> 01:05:12,520
But then there's one high dose that just like makes blows out like the instrument.

607
01:05:13,060 --> 01:05:18,280
So you want that, like, it's like to have that dynamic space to like really understand the curve.

608
01:05:19,000 --> 01:05:22,360
And so that's why the dose selection becomes very important.

609
01:05:22,360 --> 01:05:29,170
And a lot of people will run like a preliminary study before they're bigger study to understand what they think that that curve is going to look like.

610
01:05:30,260 --> 01:05:39,649
Um, yeah. And so, like, you know, there are kind of general ways of like sort of kind of standard ways of like coming up

611
01:05:39,650 --> 01:05:44,540
with a dose response curve and absence or dose selection and absence of other information.

612
01:05:44,900 --> 01:05:49,860
So you might take like 90% of the maximally tolerated dose.

613
01:05:49,880 --> 01:05:55,100
Like it's not killing the animals, but it's like pretty high up. They're pretty close to it, 50%.

614
01:05:55,520 --> 01:06:04,520
And then down to like 10 to 25%. So. And then you're going to want to understand or want to select what Oregon sites are going to be looking at.

615
01:06:05,920 --> 01:06:10,420
We're going to look at. It's kind of hard to process like all of the organs from an animal.

616
01:06:13,130 --> 01:06:15,950
These regulatory agencies that they do like one of these big studies, though,

617
01:06:15,950 --> 01:06:20,090
they're going to try to like basically look at everything, but it's like an academic setting.

618
01:06:20,270 --> 01:06:27,710
You typically don't have the resources to, like, save every last little piece of tissue and evaluate them all for presence of tumors.

619
01:06:27,800 --> 01:06:32,360
So there's like a selection that has to happen there sometimes. Yeah.

620
01:06:32,360 --> 01:06:35,300
And what are you going to run? So this is going to be a lifetime exposure.

621
01:06:35,330 --> 01:06:40,970
So are you going to be taking samples of blood or urine to test certain like clinical or like.

622
01:06:42,170 --> 01:06:48,920
Yeah, certainly clinical or like pathological impacts over the course of that animal's lifetime.

623
01:06:49,100 --> 01:06:54,500
To get more information, are you seeing like an increase in certain enzymes in the blood prior to like that terminal?

624
01:06:57,230 --> 01:07:00,710
You know, like they were talking in the like looking for tumors.

625
01:07:02,030 --> 01:07:08,690
So that could give you some important information. And then are there any other like molecular mechanistic endpoints you're going to be looking at?

626
01:07:08,700 --> 01:07:13,040
So there's a lot of thought that you could imagine doing this for just one chemical.

627
01:07:13,040 --> 01:07:21,549
It's like a pretty big undertaking. And if anyone's interested in learning more, you can click on this.

628
01:07:21,550 --> 01:07:25,420
And there's more about, like, national toxicology program protocols.

629
01:07:27,690 --> 01:07:36,920
Uh, let's see. Okay, so somebody get some feedback from you knowing that we use, like, animal bio assays.

630
01:07:36,940 --> 01:07:42,999
Can anyone name, like, a potential issue with translation for risk assessment from an animal?

631
01:07:43,000 --> 01:07:46,600
Like, let's say we have we have this nice dose response curve in a rat model.

632
01:07:48,430 --> 01:07:53,140
What are the issues in terms of translating that for like a human risk assessment?

633
01:07:54,690 --> 01:08:03,200
Any thoughts? Going back to your last slide, slide, talking about the dose levels, how you would give like 90%, 50%,

634
01:08:03,200 --> 01:08:10,600
10 to 25% of the maximally tolerated dose that might not be synonymous with the amount that people are generally exposed to.

635
01:08:10,610 --> 01:08:14,220
So. You'd want to take that into consideration.

636
01:08:15,170 --> 01:08:19,070
Yeah, very good point. Yeah. Like the doses historically.

637
01:08:19,080 --> 01:08:23,909
Well, that there's sort of a trend in toxicology now to move the animal models more to at least

638
01:08:23,910 --> 01:08:30,150
including a few like really low level doses to get that more a more direct comparison.

639
01:08:30,690 --> 01:08:39,000
But historically, certainly like a lot of the data is coming out of, uh, studies where we were dosing like pretty high levels of these chemicals.

640
01:08:39,110 --> 01:08:46,950
And so that kind of makes that transition. In interpreting what this would look like in a human setting, hard for challenging any other sorts.

641
01:08:48,950 --> 01:08:54,180
Maybe the. Oh, sorry. So I've never raised their hand, do you?

642
01:08:55,820 --> 01:08:59,570
I just could say also mixtures. Me? Yes. Yes.

643
01:09:00,560 --> 01:09:05,660
We're exposed to mixtures. We're not exposed to one chemical. So how the heck do we model that?

644
01:09:05,900 --> 01:09:09,370
You can imagine doing this forever. I mean, you just can't do it, really.

645
01:09:09,380 --> 01:09:16,220
You know, like using this approach, you could design every single mixture out there, like, and test.

646
01:09:16,590 --> 01:09:21,230
So we need to come up with this is like, again, current issue in the field.

647
01:09:21,260 --> 01:09:24,220
It was like, how do we systematically do this? What's the best way to do it?

648
01:09:24,230 --> 01:09:29,770
So there are some really creative ways people are coming out with like how to do this in a better way.

649
01:09:29,780 --> 01:09:35,480
But yes, mixed here is a great point. You know, maybe the mechanisms of toxicity are different.

650
01:09:35,960 --> 01:09:42,140
Yeah, there is like pretty obvious biological differences between like a rat and a human and a mouse that a human.

651
01:09:42,500 --> 01:09:45,600
So is that pathway you're looking at even relevant?

652
01:09:45,710 --> 01:09:53,210
There's certain chemicals that are like super toxic in rats and not as toxic in humans or vice versa in mice.

653
01:09:53,510 --> 01:09:55,760
You know, like it's like phthalates,

654
01:09:55,760 --> 01:10:05,000
I think like with like the anti androgenic effects of phthalates I think are much more pronounced in rats versus lines and it's a double check.

655
01:10:05,450 --> 01:10:07,990
But yeah, so there's like differences across the species.

656
01:10:08,000 --> 01:10:19,880
So which species you select could be really important on the timing of doses for humans won't be as precise as like animal models probably.

657
01:10:20,240 --> 01:10:25,880
Yeah, that's a really good point. The timing, like how you dose right is going to be different.

658
01:10:26,330 --> 01:10:28,040
There are situations where, you know,

659
01:10:28,310 --> 01:10:34,219
people do like air pollution research where they set up something where they're like pumping a chemical into like a rat cage, for example.

660
01:10:34,220 --> 01:10:41,390
That's kind of better, like replicating the human experience or like putting it in the the cage,

661
01:10:41,390 --> 01:10:47,210
like the water in the cage, a water bottle, you know, kind of mimicking the drinking water exposure.

662
01:10:47,630 --> 01:10:53,210
But a lot of stuff will be like, say, injecting a chemical or putting it in there.

663
01:10:54,470 --> 01:10:56,000
Like some of our experiments we've used,

664
01:10:56,000 --> 01:11:01,900
like a way for we put a chemical on a wafer and the rat meets the wafer and it's just like one dose a day, which doesn't really,

665
01:11:02,270 --> 01:11:09,110
to be honest, like replicate the exposure that we see like on a job site, for example,

666
01:11:09,110 --> 01:11:15,020
where someone might be breathing it in and it's like a different round of exposure. We have to think about that, how that might change the response.

667
01:11:15,380 --> 01:11:19,340
There's some advantages to it because we know exactly how much they got to eat it that way for really fast.

668
01:11:20,690 --> 01:11:25,840
We know that they got that hold up. So, yeah, that's another one.

669
01:11:25,850 --> 01:11:35,630
Anything else? So unlike the species differences, there could be differences in like genetics or metabolism and things like that.

670
01:11:36,110 --> 01:11:41,480
There's a couple of things there. Yeah. So there's differences in like genetics and metabolism, like you're talking from animals to people.

671
01:11:42,050 --> 01:11:50,000
Yeah, that's that's one. Another thing is how variable do you think the standard like mouth strain is in terms of genetics?

672
01:11:51,800 --> 01:11:58,130
Are they genetically similar or dissimilar? So more similar.

673
01:11:58,600 --> 01:12:03,400
Yeah, they're like basically like they're all like inbred and very like genetically the same.

674
01:12:03,970 --> 01:12:08,870
Whereas humans are ultra. Right. Same thing with rats.

675
01:12:08,890 --> 01:12:16,299
Like, they're all like. And the idea there is. There's a lot of advantages to that because you want to get you don't want like for a lot of studies,

676
01:12:16,300 --> 01:12:24,010
you're not wanting to get a bunch of variability introduced by genetic variation, but in terms of applying that in a public health setting.

677
01:12:26,090 --> 01:12:30,800
Humans are genetically quite diverse. So that's another sort of limitation there.

678
01:12:32,200 --> 01:12:37,870
Any others. It's about time to wrap up. So I'll take one last one.

679
01:12:38,840 --> 01:12:43,969
Let's see how many we hit. Now, probably the last slide. Limited number of doses tested.

680
01:12:43,970 --> 01:12:48,480
I think we talked about that again, historically, really high doses are tested.

681
01:12:48,510 --> 01:12:50,360
So that makes it difficult to extrapolate.

682
01:12:52,610 --> 01:12:58,820
There's kind of differences in terms of like just again, like the response in terms of giving a positive versus negative result.

683
01:13:01,250 --> 01:13:07,640
It's like rats and mice. There's like differences in terms of like one type chemical might be picked up as a toxicant in a rat, but not in the mouse.

684
01:13:08,390 --> 01:13:12,020
But there is there's like a decent amount of concordance there, but not like 100%.

685
01:13:13,300 --> 01:13:18,050
Let's see that again. Like just differences. Potency can vary widely between species.

686
01:13:18,440 --> 01:13:24,770
So for like aflatoxin, rats and mice have like a 100,000 fold difference in sensitivity to aflatoxin.

687
01:13:26,570 --> 01:13:31,219
And then yeah, I think someone also mentioned like model organisms might not identify mechanisms

688
01:13:31,220 --> 01:13:35,600
of tox might identify mechanisms of toxicity that are not relevant to humans.

689
01:13:36,350 --> 01:13:41,299
So this is where like as a toxicologist using these models,

690
01:13:41,300 --> 01:13:47,840
you have to have a nice like baseline of like understanding like, like comparative biology.

691
01:13:47,840 --> 01:13:56,210
Like what are we replicating in this, in this mouse model in terms of extrapolating this to humans and is like pronounced differences,

692
01:13:56,360 --> 01:14:03,050
especially in my field with placental biology, there's like big difference in how the placenta forms across these species.

693
01:14:03,890 --> 01:14:08,210
So I'll end there and we'll take this back up on Wednesday.

694
01:14:10,300 --> 01:14:13,650
Thank you so much. Three more lectures to go.
