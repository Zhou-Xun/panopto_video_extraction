1
00:00:00,660 --> 00:00:08,190
Oh, yeah, I forgot. I've never done this before. Rather than trying to make me recorded, I feel so professional.

2
00:00:09,580 --> 00:00:13,170
I'm doing a TED talk. Okay. So, yeah. How many of you know about the suite?

3
00:00:13,170 --> 00:00:17,159
One senator for writing? Have you heard of this before? Where do you know about it?

4
00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:21,450
And you can tell me your name too. So make it out of the city.

5
00:00:22,440 --> 00:00:28,589
And I go there for, like, assignments or any writing based things.

6
00:00:28,590 --> 00:00:32,450
Look at it. It is a lot of fun. Yeah, exactly. So it's like a 15 minute one.

7
00:00:32,710 --> 00:00:38,970
I just did that. You're trying to provide that modern language on Washington Street?

8
00:00:39,270 --> 00:00:48,060
Yeah, just graduate students. You can come and see faculty for anything, so it can be coursework for any course work you're doing.

9
00:00:48,390 --> 00:00:52,560
It can be articles. Yeah. Do you just like flipping your microphone.

10
00:00:52,770 --> 00:00:56,550
Oh, yeah. Oh, and you can hear me better.

11
00:00:58,140 --> 00:01:03,719
You can support it. My friends are just like folders. You can also just take it off your shirt and little bit.

12
00:01:03,720 --> 00:01:10,610
If that's more, that's probably better. Yeah. So here I am testing for myself, but oh, that would be really close.

13
00:01:10,830 --> 00:01:14,170
Remember me? Maybe I can do them online.

14
00:01:14,310 --> 00:01:19,110
Okay. Thanks. This is so weird. Yeah.

15
00:01:19,110 --> 00:01:25,260
So coursework, if you're writing conference papers or you're writing articles for publication, submission,

16
00:01:25,530 --> 00:01:32,249
professional development materials like we're going to work on today, that would be the first thing I was thinking of writing workshops.

17
00:01:32,250 --> 00:01:39,059
So if you go to the Sweetland website and look for graduate students writing support as graduate students,

18
00:01:39,060 --> 00:01:43,500
you can sign up for one hour workshops every single week.

19
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:49,140
You can split that up into two half hour workshops, and that's through the entire semester.

20
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:54,120
This is a master's class, right? So some of these won't be pertinent to you.

21
00:01:54,420 --> 00:02:00,059
So if you skip down to where it says write together, is it sort of like an accountability session?

22
00:02:00,060 --> 00:02:03,240
It's virtual or in-person. It's also a North Quad.

23
00:02:03,660 --> 00:02:11,850
I believe this semester is on Fridays, so you can show up and for any amount of time that you want, it's 3 hours long.

24
00:02:12,570 --> 00:02:15,990
Again, I'm not doing it this semester, so I don't remember the time.

25
00:02:15,990 --> 00:02:24,510
So maybe 9 to 12. And there's another faculty member there who, um, is just there for you to ask some questions or you're like,

26
00:02:24,510 --> 00:02:29,250
other people are here writing in a virtual space or again in person.

27
00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:32,490
And for me as a writer, accountability is really helpful.

28
00:02:32,490 --> 00:02:38,040
So if like I have this term paper I need to write, I'm going to go and sit in this space and get that writing done.

29
00:02:38,580 --> 00:02:45,060
I'm Sweetland also partners with them to put on workshops similar to what I'm going to do today.

30
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:50,690
So look for those advertisements that will come out through wrap them.

31
00:02:50,730 --> 00:02:54,480
We also send them out from Sweetland to different departments,

32
00:02:54,480 --> 00:03:00,770
but it covers things from like transitioning to graduate writing, argumentative writing.

33
00:03:00,780 --> 00:03:08,400
I'm going to do one on publication, so like revising or a course paper for publication purposes.

34
00:03:09,510 --> 00:03:13,500
So that's another workshop you may want to or service you may want to look for.

35
00:03:13,860 --> 00:03:18,540
And then the final in the course is at the bottom, probably writing 630.

36
00:03:18,540 --> 00:03:20,610
That would be the one that would be relevant for you.

37
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:26,970
So again, if if you want to take a one credit complete and complete course, it sounds like much like this one,

38
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:34,520
where again, you want structure and feedback and accountability to work on some type of paper.

39
00:03:34,530 --> 00:03:42,720
Again, for a research project or an article for publication, you can join that class as well.

40
00:03:42,870 --> 00:03:48,390
So any questions about the three or.

41
00:03:51,430 --> 00:03:58,089
I'll also add, which I didn't say for writing workshops, you can sign up for appointments online or go in person.

42
00:03:58,090 --> 00:04:03,130
So it's up to you and your schedule and your availability and things like that.

43
00:04:05,350 --> 00:04:09,520
Okay. There. So no questions like how do I do this with one hand?

44
00:04:09,980 --> 00:04:18,910
Okay. So I pass these rosaries out and after that for actually because that would be the first genre that we're working on.

45
00:04:19,960 --> 00:04:23,260
And how many of you have created resumes before?

46
00:04:23,920 --> 00:04:27,280
Probably. I don't know. Is that like a requirement to get into this program?

47
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:34,380
Maybe. Okay, cool. So you already have some experience when you think of that particular type of professional development genre.

48
00:04:34,390 --> 00:04:38,710
What are some of the things that you think a meeting like what?

49
00:04:38,740 --> 00:04:44,110
When, where do you put on a resume? Why do you write resumes?

50
00:04:45,370 --> 00:04:46,719
You can answer either those questions.

51
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:58,180
Let's start with the bigger rhetorical question like what is the purpose of a resume ultimately to show your past experience or your vocation?

52
00:04:58,510 --> 00:05:02,659
Yeah, absolutely. There are through that past experience and your qualifications,

53
00:05:02,660 --> 00:05:06,850
you're making an argument about yourself that you were the best person for whatever

54
00:05:07,210 --> 00:05:11,020
position that you are applying for and that you're using your resume for.

55
00:05:11,470 --> 00:05:18,580
What is coming around is a sample resume that is on your canvass site from a former student.

56
00:05:18,610 --> 00:05:23,530
Is that correct? This was a combination of.

57
00:05:23,530 --> 00:05:29,770
Okay. Okay. I'm going to share. Okay. Yeah. So this is like a real deal resume that we can use as an example.

58
00:05:30,790 --> 00:05:36,880
Yeah. So again, talking about resumes by sketches and then you're going to be able to do some work yourself throughout this workshop.

59
00:05:37,510 --> 00:05:49,060
So resumes are living documents, meaning you always want to update your resumes based on new experience you're doing also.

60
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:52,450
So it's good to have sort of like a template, like a general resume.

61
00:05:52,540 --> 00:05:58,809
But I would save all the resumes you create because depending on the positions you apply for and I see some people nodding.

62
00:05:58,810 --> 00:06:01,210
So this is probably not new information for you,

63
00:06:01,690 --> 00:06:11,140
but depending on who your audiences and the purpose of a particular resume and the type of job or research grant you're applying for,

64
00:06:11,350 --> 00:06:13,030
there's going to be different information, right?

65
00:06:13,030 --> 00:06:19,150
So if you have like ten different recipes saved, you're updating those different resumes or five, whatever,

66
00:06:19,510 --> 00:06:23,950
then will be easier to just submit something when opportunities come up because you're

67
00:06:23,950 --> 00:06:30,249
keeping them current and you have specific ones for different types of opportunities.

68
00:06:30,250 --> 00:06:38,140
Again, jobs versus research versus teaching or whatever you're going to do in your careers when you're writing your resumes.

69
00:06:38,890 --> 00:06:47,110
Think about like the language you're using and how you were framing these past experiences and qualifications like this gentleman said.

70
00:06:47,770 --> 00:06:56,920
So it's not just that you're listing the tasks that you accomplished, but if you can fit in these different bulleted points about your qualifications,

71
00:06:57,490 --> 00:07:06,610
try and think about how to express how you did your job, why you did your job, and the impact your your experience had as well.

72
00:07:06,610 --> 00:07:11,230
So and we're going to see some examples talking a little bit more about what I mean by that.

73
00:07:12,580 --> 00:07:19,479
Also, I would think about and again, it depends on who you are, your background in the why you're using your resume,

74
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:23,260
like what is the position that you're using this specific reasoning for?

75
00:07:23,770 --> 00:07:30,280
But think about balancing the information you include between people and technical skills.

76
00:07:30,790 --> 00:07:34,180
So like, you know, when are you working with other people?

77
00:07:34,360 --> 00:07:41,020
Because interpersonal skills is really important obviously in different, um, again, opportunities we have,

78
00:07:41,740 --> 00:07:47,200
but also of course the technical skills, the educational background you have is going to be important to you.

79
00:07:47,210 --> 00:07:50,290
So how are you talking about when you supervise people,

80
00:07:50,290 --> 00:07:57,370
when you volunteered at a certain place along with I mean, I honestly don't know what you do in this program.

81
00:07:59,260 --> 00:08:04,330
What would be some technical skills that you might have that you would include on a recipe for my own curiosity?

82
00:08:06,730 --> 00:08:10,150
Ah, yeah, that's a good one. Statistical. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

83
00:08:10,180 --> 00:08:16,450
Okay, great. Thank you. Thanks for saving me. Awesome. Okay. And then also you want resumes are obviously really short.

84
00:08:16,450 --> 00:08:22,959
We have a one page resume in front of us. I guess it would depend on the position and Becky would know better than I do.

85
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:26,980
They ever go on to two pages like later in someone's career?

86
00:08:26,980 --> 00:08:33,820
Would they ever extend beyond? Maybe. But most of your all of your resumes really should fit on one page,

87
00:08:33,820 --> 00:08:38,530
especially for the purpose of applying for an internship, which is what we're going to be crafting.

88
00:08:38,530 --> 00:08:45,670
Our reasoning is for this. Okay, okay, great. Let's you have very extensive work experience, but I don't think most of you do.

89
00:08:45,910 --> 00:08:49,870
Okay. But yeah, I mean, part of that is like, you know, you don't want to.

90
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:54,020
Like part of my language. We don't want to, like, [INAUDIBLE] off the audience.

91
00:08:54,030 --> 00:08:59,839
Like, if you have two pages and they ask for one or it's like the fields expectation is one page.

92
00:08:59,840 --> 00:09:06,200
Like if they see two pages, they may not even look at it and they'll just like toss it where I guess everything's on computers now.

93
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:12,979
So they would just ignore it. So really think about like what are the professional and the field expectations

94
00:09:12,980 --> 00:09:17,180
and adhere to them as much as possible because you're in a competitive field.

95
00:09:17,780 --> 00:09:23,540
And then for the design and format, you know, make sure that it's consistent with your font.

96
00:09:23,540 --> 00:09:26,780
You're spacing the what am I trying to say?

97
00:09:26,930 --> 00:09:31,820
The margins. Thank you. Your language is really concise.

98
00:09:31,850 --> 00:09:35,629
You're using professional language. It's not cluttered.

99
00:09:35,630 --> 00:09:39,530
So and that goes along with that consistency.

100
00:09:39,530 --> 00:09:42,709
I would say like for the headings all look the same.

101
00:09:42,710 --> 00:09:47,390
If it's bolded, if your headings are bolded in one place, then it's that way all the way through.

102
00:09:47,780 --> 00:09:54,559
And you're not doing too many different types of font style things either.

103
00:09:54,560 --> 00:10:03,530
So that's sort of like an overview. And then also in writing me and again, this may not be like new to any of you,

104
00:10:03,530 --> 00:10:08,030
but I found this information on this website which we will go to in a minute.

105
00:10:08,030 --> 00:10:12,079
So it's the University of Pittsburgh School of Public Health.

106
00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:18,080
So it's really helpful. And I have some other example resumes from people in public health.

107
00:10:18,950 --> 00:10:23,240
So because depending on the field you're in, there could be some different information that you include.

108
00:10:23,750 --> 00:10:27,410
But at the top you have identifying information like who you are,

109
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:34,370
what you are looking for out of whatever profession opportunity that you're applying for.

110
00:10:34,370 --> 00:10:40,699
In this case, it sounds like an internship where they have that kind of like statement at the top for an internship.

111
00:10:40,700 --> 00:10:45,410
Like what I'm looking for out of this happen to know, okay, you'll find a specific entry.

112
00:10:45,420 --> 00:10:48,709
Okay. So you shouldn't need like a objective.

113
00:10:48,710 --> 00:10:53,570
Okay. So in the future you can think about writing one of these, but right now do not.

114
00:10:54,500 --> 00:10:58,910
What about a profile or qualification summary? Is that something that they would have?

115
00:10:59,960 --> 00:11:03,710
And we'll look at what all of this stuff means to. So probably not.

116
00:11:03,860 --> 00:11:08,689
Okay. Okay. Yeah. And all of this stuff is also very personal though.

117
00:11:08,690 --> 00:11:15,230
So like if you feel like that describes your resume the best, it's not a bad idea to put it on there.

118
00:11:15,500 --> 00:11:22,250
Okay. So it's not limitless unless there are like certain for sure standards, I think.

119
00:11:22,250 --> 00:11:29,540
But if if you feel like that is how you want to come across to your audience, then that represents you in your career.

120
00:11:30,050 --> 00:11:33,520
I don't think that's a bad thing to include. Okay. Yeah, yeah.

121
00:11:33,560 --> 00:11:40,250
So it's sort of this tension of like, yes, what who is the audience trying to figure out who they are in their expectations?

122
00:11:40,250 --> 00:11:44,840
What is your purpose for the resume again? What is the opportunity that you're using versus the ME for it?

123
00:11:44,840 --> 00:11:52,130
But then yeah, like back is saying like what are your personal experiences and goals and how do you make all of those match?

124
00:11:53,210 --> 00:11:59,450
So here's more information. So yeah, so identifying information, your name, address, phone number, email address.

125
00:11:59,840 --> 00:12:07,059
That objective is like focusing on a specific type of skill or like the job career you're applying for.

126
00:12:07,060 --> 00:12:10,190
It does not sound relevant for this particular instance.

127
00:12:11,180 --> 00:12:20,210
And then the objective statement is, let's see, I'm like, this is see, I have a CV, so we don't I don't use this professional qualification summary.

128
00:12:20,450 --> 00:12:24,470
It's interesting going to other genres that I haven't used in a long time.

129
00:12:24,590 --> 00:12:28,819
I do think in general to the objective and the profile and qualifications.

130
00:12:28,820 --> 00:12:31,930
So they're becoming antiquated, are they? Okay.

131
00:12:32,120 --> 00:12:36,560
Okay. And I don't think most people expect that anymore.

132
00:12:36,920 --> 00:12:41,690
Yeah. And they kind of take up space for other nice things that you could display.

133
00:12:41,870 --> 00:12:42,259
Yeah.

134
00:12:42,260 --> 00:12:50,659
It seems a little redundant because it's sort of like a short paragraph describing what you put right down below and your bulleted list of skills.

135
00:12:50,660 --> 00:12:53,960
So thanks for that information. That's good for me to know as well.

136
00:12:54,440 --> 00:13:02,360
Obviously you want to include your education. That is definitely something that your internships are going to be looking for.

137
00:13:03,290 --> 00:13:09,650
And then professional experience, I guess again, it will depend on like where you are in careers,

138
00:13:10,610 --> 00:13:14,870
what experience you had before or while you're in this master's program.

139
00:13:16,370 --> 00:13:20,960
I mean, so if they have not had a sorry public health experience before,

140
00:13:21,470 --> 00:13:28,879
what's your recommendation for highlighting other professional experience that were there related skills?

141
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:34,250
I know that, yeah. Yeah. You have skills that are relevant and definitely good to include on there,

142
00:13:34,250 --> 00:13:42,140
but maybe flip flop around some of the sections because you have some service experience that's directly related to public health.

143
00:13:43,580 --> 00:13:48,320
And so maybe that comes back to your education or something like that.

144
00:13:48,590 --> 00:13:50,480
It's all it's all very, very personal.

145
00:13:50,620 --> 00:13:57,440
Although it's lovely that we have such a great speaker here giving you general tips, but when it's what, it's going to come down to you.

146
00:13:57,590 --> 00:14:06,560
Mm hmm. Yeah. And yeah. And then knowing. Knowing where you are applying for and what skills they are looking for at that internship.

147
00:14:07,280 --> 00:14:16,459
Um, other experiences, that's super vague, but again, sort of like what is going to make you stand out as a candidate for this particular internship?

148
00:14:16,460 --> 00:14:20,510
You're applying for special skills as its own section,

149
00:14:20,510 --> 00:14:26,600
which you've probably done it for your resume of language and communication skills and things like that.

150
00:14:27,420 --> 00:14:30,530
Um, what about honors and awards?

151
00:14:30,530 --> 00:14:33,560
Is that something that you would encourage as well?

152
00:14:33,590 --> 00:14:37,780
I think if you have something that's relevant, not good, but very good.

153
00:14:38,420 --> 00:14:48,139
Yeah. I think the key is, is that I think for most major headings, don't you recommend like at least two or three kind of lines?

154
00:14:48,140 --> 00:14:51,890
Like you wouldn't want a major heading but just like one. Right. Right. That's a good point.

155
00:14:51,890 --> 00:14:56,719
So for each section, have at least two examples to fit under that.

156
00:14:56,720 --> 00:15:06,020
And so if you have done like education and professional experience and the special skills and then you've run out of space,

157
00:15:06,020 --> 00:15:07,970
then yeah, you wouldn't want to cram the awards.

158
00:15:08,210 --> 00:15:15,320
And so yeah, again, there's a lot of decisions that you get to make depending on who you are and what you're applying for.

159
00:15:15,770 --> 00:15:19,909
And then so for Pittsburgh, it says like references are on like another page.

160
00:15:19,910 --> 00:15:24,709
But I think again, this depends on the internship application, I would guess.

161
00:15:24,710 --> 00:15:29,810
And if you're already providing those references elsewhere, you wouldn't need a second page to include that.

162
00:15:29,810 --> 00:15:33,810
Does that sound? Yeah, it really just depends on condition.

163
00:15:35,300 --> 00:15:42,440
Um, okay. And then for the formats, there's chronological and functional product logical.

164
00:15:42,440 --> 00:15:45,019
I mean, this is what Pittsburgh said, but it's usually preferred.

165
00:15:45,020 --> 00:15:53,570
I mean, that's the case in my field too, where you start with the most recent thing and then work backwards in time,

166
00:15:54,230 --> 00:15:58,430
whereas functional is emphasizing skills.

167
00:15:59,630 --> 00:16:07,310
And then yeah, so of course you're also doing that with a chronological format, just with chronological,

168
00:16:07,310 --> 00:16:14,210
you are doing a backwards in time presentation of where you are now and where you've been in the past.

169
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:22,300
So any questions? Okay, so what I want.

170
00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:27,280
Oh, yeah, go ahead. Lay out. Right, yes. Okay. Um, something that I don't know me.

171
00:16:27,350 --> 00:16:31,160
It's getting to something I had on my rosemary. It's like preoccupation.

172
00:16:31,490 --> 00:16:38,780
Mm mm. But the problem is, is that the names of the publications are really long with all of the authors and the titles,

173
00:16:38,780 --> 00:16:42,430
so I don't know how to include that without it taking up. Yeah, you and I could.

174
00:16:42,500 --> 00:16:47,210
We can talk about that. Yeah. If anyone else has that. Does anyone else have publications?

175
00:16:48,410 --> 00:16:51,770
Okay. Yeah, but are you kidding? Oh, looks like one person.

176
00:16:51,770 --> 00:16:57,259
Oh, I'm sorry. Yeah, yeah, I can.

177
00:16:57,260 --> 00:17:00,319
I could maybe post some examples on campus for people.

178
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:03,440
And then also, if you get any of the future, you could do that.

179
00:17:04,280 --> 00:17:10,970
And there there's different ways that you can improve that situation to maximize your space and to try to make it one.

180
00:17:11,230 --> 00:17:17,870
Yeah. Yeah, that's a good question. Yeah. Because again, on CVS, you have like endless space to include all this stuff.

181
00:17:17,870 --> 00:17:21,270
So resumé has to be a lot more decisive. So yeah.

182
00:17:23,060 --> 00:17:32,060
Okay, so what I wanted you to do now with a partner or like a group of three is to take a look at the role for me that was provided to you.

183
00:17:32,060 --> 00:17:36,620
And we're going to do a little bit of a mentor text analysis or a mentor text

184
00:17:36,620 --> 00:17:41,930
is an example of the type of document that you yourself are going to write.

185
00:17:42,290 --> 00:17:47,590
Can I somehow like Ms.? Oh yeah. We're going to come back to that and put my slides in the right order.

186
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:54,290
We'll come back to that extra time. Sorry. So something else that you want to keep in mind is this idea of like power words,

187
00:17:54,290 --> 00:17:59,299
which are also so power words are verbs that are like really powerful.

188
00:17:59,300 --> 00:18:01,459
Does this I'm sure this is probably familiar to you.

189
00:18:01,460 --> 00:18:10,310
Like, how do you a use language that is going to communicate what you've done, do it in an attention grabbing way,

190
00:18:10,490 --> 00:18:14,960
and also so that you're not, like repeating the same language over and over again.

191
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:18,079
So I like this slide.

192
00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:23,629
I honestly don't remember where I got it from, but it talks about like, well, if you're talking about any of these types of skills,

193
00:18:23,630 --> 00:18:34,250
like financial skills, for example, it has a nice little lexicon that you can pull from to to Yeah.

194
00:18:34,250 --> 00:18:40,850
To use in your resume for those reasons, getting attention, not repeating yourself,

195
00:18:40,850 --> 00:18:46,040
and then also being specific to like the job that you're applying for as well or internship.

196
00:18:47,030 --> 00:18:49,370
Something else you can think about. And I got this from.

197
00:18:50,590 --> 00:19:00,560
Americans, maybe the opportunity hub where they talk about professional development and genres as well as this idea of the bullet plus method.

198
00:19:00,580 --> 00:19:06,159
Have you ever heard of this before? Sort of alluding to it at the beginning of my presentation.

199
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:10,810
Where on your resumes, if you can do more than just like list your skills.

200
00:19:11,380 --> 00:19:16,080
But like this is what I did more than that.

201
00:19:16,090 --> 00:19:23,260
Talk about how you perform your duties, why those tasks are important, and the impact of the task as well.

202
00:19:23,260 --> 00:19:25,360
And you don't have to do all three for each bullet,

203
00:19:25,360 --> 00:19:32,980
but like choose which one of these make the most sense for the particular experience or skill that you're talking about.

204
00:19:33,430 --> 00:19:40,509
So for example, instead of just saying enhanced interpersonal skills, you could say,

205
00:19:40,510 --> 00:19:46,479
I did that by facilitating cross-cultural conversations with Malawian teens and community members.

206
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:52,270
So this would be a how how you enhance interpersonal skills was through these methods.

207
00:19:52,810 --> 00:20:00,100
Again, I understand that then you're playing with like more space, more words, and you want to be concise to say again,

208
00:20:00,100 --> 00:20:07,149
you're thinking about you're making the decisions about when does it make sense to keep things general and more abstract,

209
00:20:07,150 --> 00:20:12,070
and when does it make sense to use one of these bullets bullet plus.

210
00:20:12,730 --> 00:20:17,920
So instead of saying create a real interest monitoring tool, I don't even know what this means.

211
00:20:18,190 --> 00:20:22,240
I don't know what I'm. Yeah. Anyways, then you would say why you did it?

212
00:20:22,930 --> 00:20:26,530
To study the effect of rate changes on the foreign exchange level.

213
00:20:26,800 --> 00:20:32,800
And then lastly, directed actors and productions directed some really specific who these actors were,

214
00:20:32,800 --> 00:20:41,640
how many of them there were, and what was the impact of that so that all these productions were able to be performed.

215
00:20:41,650 --> 00:20:45,160
So you can think about Bullet Plus as well.

216
00:20:45,460 --> 00:20:49,360
Any questions about this for the power words?

217
00:20:50,730 --> 00:20:55,390
Okay. Okay. Now. Okay. This is where I want to be.

218
00:20:56,650 --> 00:21:01,470
Okay. So looking at the resume in front of you and I can write this.

219
00:21:01,480 --> 00:21:09,810
Oh, there's no board. Okay. Is would you say that this resume is okay?

220
00:21:09,860 --> 00:21:13,360
What are the sections? I guess you can pull up the canvas.

221
00:21:13,810 --> 00:21:17,770
Might as my slide deck on canvas. If not, that's okay.

222
00:21:18,790 --> 00:21:22,420
I can go back and forth. So what sections does a resume have?

223
00:21:23,350 --> 00:21:26,890
How did the sections relate with the author's current position?

224
00:21:27,370 --> 00:21:32,150
How is that formatted as a chronological or functional, and does that make sense?

225
00:21:32,170 --> 00:21:42,640
Again, we don't necessarily know what position this person was applying for, but based on where they are, it looks like their master's student does.

226
00:21:43,030 --> 00:21:47,680
Does that format make sense? What do you think about the design and layout?

227
00:21:48,820 --> 00:21:54,340
Are there power words that are effective or are there instances of the bullet plus method?

228
00:21:56,050 --> 00:21:58,660
So I guess if you have access to canvas,

229
00:21:58,660 --> 00:22:05,830
then you will be able to see my slide deck side and think about how the room is going to be laid out and what you would have access to.

230
00:22:07,030 --> 00:22:13,210
But yeah, a general analysis of this resume for the sections, the format, the design and layout,

231
00:22:13,660 --> 00:22:17,290
power words and bullet points, which I know I just went over with you right now.

232
00:22:18,070 --> 00:22:22,090
What do you think here? Oh, there is. Okay. It's the funny little one.

233
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:26,890
Okay. So I will write some of this here, but, you know, talk to each other about what you're seeing,

234
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:33,010
and then I'll provide the language that you need in order to answer some of these questions.

235
00:22:33,310 --> 00:22:37,600
So do you know what I'm asking? If you're going to pair up with someone.

236
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:43,490
I'm sorry. Right. And. Okay.

237
00:22:46,084 --> 00:22:46,924
Undergraduate.

238
00:22:47,554 --> 00:22:56,854
And we can start maybe let's start from like the more interesting place where actually let me, let me start with this and let me unload myself.

239
00:22:58,144 --> 00:23:01,294
Not that I'm using this correctly, but, um. Yeah.

240
00:23:01,294 --> 00:23:11,134
So what are your general thoughts about this resume? Like if you are the audience who is going to like hire or take on this student as an intern?

241
00:23:11,674 --> 00:23:13,204
What what would you have to say?

242
00:23:13,204 --> 00:23:21,494
So that could be an opportunity to sort of like summarize all of your thoughts on these different criteria or what stood out to you specifically?

243
00:23:21,514 --> 00:23:29,074
Yeah, just sort of general thoughts about the resume and its effectiveness, I guess I would say we thought it was a good resume.

244
00:23:29,614 --> 00:23:33,244
Thank you for being very clear. Okay, good.

245
00:23:33,304 --> 00:23:42,664
So what what's good about it? I feel like it has a really good balance between like conveying a lot of information and still being very clear.

246
00:23:42,724 --> 00:23:49,024
Okay. Great and readable and firm and clear in terms of both, like the design and the language.

247
00:23:49,234 --> 00:23:53,974
Yeah. Okay, here's what I did. Here's what it's about, why it's relevant.

248
00:23:53,974 --> 00:23:57,114
Here's what happened, you know? Okay, all that. Okay, great.

249
00:23:57,124 --> 00:24:00,254
So it's easy to, like, skim this, get a lot of information,

250
00:24:00,274 --> 00:24:06,404
look at the cover letter and and maybe put it in that we're going to consider this pile this person piles.

251
00:24:06,424 --> 00:24:09,944
Okay. How about other folks thoughts about the resume?

252
00:24:09,994 --> 00:24:17,604
Why it's good that you wouldn't like to build on. Yeah.

253
00:24:18,134 --> 00:24:23,193
Yeah. We were back and forth a little bit on separating the public health experience

254
00:24:23,194 --> 00:24:27,694
and professional experience because we felt it would save even more room.

255
00:24:27,694 --> 00:24:32,024
If you combine like these experience sections and then think about it a little bit more.

256
00:24:32,114 --> 00:24:38,523
The bullet was in there, but we did take the ordering of kind of having like the public health stuff.

257
00:24:38,524 --> 00:24:44,013
First was good for the relevancy of like the master's program in the position and stuff like that.

258
00:24:44,014 --> 00:24:50,104
Yeah. So that's great. I'm glad you pointed out that tension because yeah, maybe someone else would have gone in a different direction,

259
00:24:50,104 --> 00:24:55,564
like you said, and or the student went in a particular direction to highlight the public health experience.

260
00:24:56,194 --> 00:24:59,224
Yeah, great. Great point. One other person.

261
00:24:59,224 --> 00:25:02,954
Yeah, go ahead. Obviously, this is a fictional living, but, um,

262
00:25:03,124 --> 00:25:09,003
I was curious what the job was they were applying for to their how something that maybe you might want to

263
00:25:09,004 --> 00:25:15,754
take out depending on what it is like if you're working in the U.S. with like a Spanish speaking population,

264
00:25:15,754 --> 00:25:19,894
you might not want to highlight all the metrics. Yeah, yeah.

265
00:25:20,044 --> 00:25:26,554
I think this is definitely a general resume. And so this is something that you can do yourself where you have something.

266
00:25:26,554 --> 00:25:33,093
And then this is your master copy where you have everything and you can kind of tweak it and

267
00:25:33,094 --> 00:25:37,774
adjust it for every single position that you're applying for based on what they're looking for.

268
00:25:37,774 --> 00:25:43,954
But that's a great point. Yeah, I like that master copy. I was calling it a template, but I like master copy a lot better.

269
00:25:43,984 --> 00:25:49,284
Yeah. Yeah. Mm hmm. Yeah. And yeah, good thinking about, like, um.

270
00:25:49,294 --> 00:25:52,704
Yeah, where? Who like the people you're going to work with.

271
00:25:52,714 --> 00:25:55,234
I mean, it could be in the United States and you're working with, like,

272
00:25:55,864 --> 00:26:01,143
people from Morocco or something like that, you know, in some part of the country.

273
00:26:01,144 --> 00:26:05,164
But yeah. Okay. Any other thoughts about the resume?

274
00:26:05,974 --> 00:26:10,114
I'm curious to see. So some people didn't raise their hands. Did people think it was bad?

275
00:26:12,304 --> 00:26:15,634
No. Okay. Okay. Okay.

276
00:26:15,724 --> 00:26:20,614
All right. Yeah. Do you have any other thoughts about the resume that you wanna share?

277
00:26:21,334 --> 00:26:24,924
Oh, I think it's a little bit crowded for my taste, personally.

278
00:26:24,924 --> 00:26:33,484
Mm hmm. I like a little bit more whitespace on my own recipes, and then it kind of highlights what you you really are strongest in.

279
00:26:34,174 --> 00:26:43,294
And so that's just my own personal preference. But I think it's also a very, you know, well formatted and clear and everything is consistent.

280
00:26:43,294 --> 00:26:48,374
So if you want to put everything on here and you think it's necessary, this is a good way to do it.

281
00:26:50,284 --> 00:26:53,654
Yeah. Okay. Yeah. Thank you. Um, great.

282
00:26:53,674 --> 00:26:56,834
Thanks for your engagement with me.

283
00:26:56,874 --> 00:27:07,204
I know that is the genre that you have for me that you're going to be working on.

284
00:27:07,354 --> 00:27:10,644
We're going to go to another drawing that is brand new to me.

285
00:27:10,654 --> 00:27:17,854
I think the subject is going to help me out with it a lot, and it's a biographical sketch or a bio sketch.

286
00:27:18,364 --> 00:27:22,724
I literally copy this slide from the NIH website.

287
00:27:22,744 --> 00:27:28,204
So I was like, This is so new to me. I want to make sure that I don't miss anything.

288
00:27:29,734 --> 00:27:40,474
So this is a genre that's highlighting your qualifications and experience for a specific role in a grant proposal or project or research project.

289
00:27:41,644 --> 00:27:52,144
And so when you're writing competing applications for grants, um, okay, I'm just like reading this because it's so new to me.

290
00:27:52,144 --> 00:27:55,364
So this is where my presentation skills are like going downhill.

291
00:27:55,804 --> 00:28:00,513
Um, so in progress reports, what does that mean?

292
00:28:00,514 --> 00:28:03,214
Can you explain that second bullet to all of this? Yeah.

293
00:28:03,244 --> 00:28:09,934
So in general, a bio sketch is going to be anything that you're applying for within the NIH role.

294
00:28:11,404 --> 00:28:19,624
They might ask for it, but also so if you apply for an internship at NIH, they could ask for a final sketch of why we're offering them to be here.

295
00:28:19,624 --> 00:28:23,464
I imagine that most of you will be focusing on resumes, is that correct?

296
00:28:24,514 --> 00:28:33,064
Yes. Okay. So just really briefly then, this is an example of my personal fellowship bio sketch that I wrote in.

297
00:28:33,484 --> 00:28:38,014
I don't know how long. It's not even a format that's approved anymore.

298
00:28:38,014 --> 00:28:41,224
So it's several years old by this point.

299
00:28:41,524 --> 00:28:50,823
And basically we use bios, sketches for age related grant applications, fellowship applications, internship application or a progress report.

300
00:28:50,824 --> 00:28:53,733
And a progress report is due annually.

301
00:28:53,734 --> 00:29:02,224
If you have a grant from NIH, you have to submit a progress report every single year that says this is what we meant to do,

302
00:29:02,284 --> 00:29:06,124
this is how we spend your money. These are some extra things that we did.

303
00:29:06,514 --> 00:29:08,854
And so the bio sketches just help.

304
00:29:08,854 --> 00:29:16,474
And I talk about something in a very specific and standardized way to help eliminate any biases against anyone in the.

305
00:29:17,694 --> 00:29:23,423
So we don't have to spend very long talking about it because I think almost everyone in this room,

306
00:29:23,424 --> 00:29:30,354
if not everyone in this room, is going to be focusing on revenues. But it is an option if you are interested in.

307
00:29:30,804 --> 00:29:34,044
I can certainly help you have a really nice little sketch.

308
00:29:34,054 --> 00:29:37,284
Okay. Awesome. Yes. Just a quick question.

309
00:29:37,294 --> 00:29:40,964
This all seems like a template that they give you ask you to fill in.

310
00:29:40,974 --> 00:29:50,183
Is that. Yeah, but it is. It is. So this like personal statement is pretty particular and then this one is a fellowship one.

311
00:29:50,184 --> 00:29:57,714
But the contributions to science is the other kind of like main aspect of the bio sketches that need a lot of crafting.

312
00:29:58,194 --> 00:30:03,503
And so there are like some tips and tricks there that we can talk about if that's the case.

313
00:30:03,504 --> 00:30:09,624
But otherwise, like, yeah, education looks exactly the same, you know, of position and honors.

314
00:30:09,624 --> 00:30:16,084
This is, like I said, a fellowship version. That's not always how it works here.

315
00:30:16,104 --> 00:30:20,394
Some of the senior versions of a bio sketch for more senior folks.

316
00:30:21,894 --> 00:30:30,294
Yeah, and I was given you the link to the NIH website so I can learn more about it as well.

317
00:30:30,294 --> 00:30:35,393
And so it's available in my slide deck or but I can give it to you, you can find it online.

318
00:30:35,394 --> 00:30:43,584
But it does seem like really helpful in terms of being very detailed of what each section requires, what the format is.

319
00:30:45,474 --> 00:30:56,003
This isn't even the best page that I could find. And they also see there's some overlap across, you know, a resumé and the bio sketch.

320
00:30:56,004 --> 00:30:59,454
And then in a couple of weeks I'll be back to talk about cover letters.

321
00:30:59,754 --> 00:31:02,784
And so these are all documents that like speak to each other.

322
00:31:03,054 --> 00:31:07,644
And so it's helpful to have like back or seeing a master copy of your resume, for example,

323
00:31:07,914 --> 00:31:12,384
that you can pull things out to put in your bio sketch or to put in your cover letter.

324
00:31:12,654 --> 00:31:18,654
And of course, the bio sketch that you can see, even just from the personal statement or in a cover letter,

325
00:31:18,654 --> 00:31:21,744
you have more room to elaborate on your experiences.

326
00:31:22,104 --> 00:31:32,844
So having that resume like done and ready to go is a great starting document to then build off of for these other professional documents.

327
00:31:34,074 --> 00:31:37,854
Yeah. Anything else I should add about the bio sketch?

328
00:31:38,304 --> 00:31:46,283
So it's something to people who are looking to either go to or stay in academia that will be

329
00:31:46,284 --> 00:31:50,304
something that you will have to be familiar with probably if you're going to health research.

330
00:31:50,994 --> 00:31:53,554
Yeah. And again, so you can see some similarities.

331
00:31:53,554 --> 00:32:02,123
So like personal statement, maybe that's replacing some of that antiquated like a objective statement that we're on resumes,

332
00:32:02,124 --> 00:32:05,574
but for a bio sketch you would need something similar.

333
00:32:06,714 --> 00:32:15,533
Yeah. Talking about your experience and just like the resumes reverse chronological order and appointments and honors,

334
00:32:15,534 --> 00:32:18,983
just like a resume, the contributions to science.

335
00:32:18,984 --> 00:32:21,444
I think that's interesting.

336
00:32:21,444 --> 00:32:31,224
I included there's more I think I but I included this a B section because I was interested in the fact that it's like usually just senior people

337
00:32:31,224 --> 00:32:40,733
that would complete that section unless you are somebody that is promoting diversity and that could include high school students and undergrads.

338
00:32:40,734 --> 00:32:49,884
So I think that's really interesting. So maybe depending on who you are and your background in what promoting diversity means,

339
00:32:49,884 --> 00:32:58,884
which is both great and problematic and I won't say any more about that right now, you may be filling out that section as well.

340
00:32:59,604 --> 00:33:05,393
And similar with the scholastic performance is if you're promoting diversity and health related research,

341
00:33:05,394 --> 00:33:11,544
then maybe as master's students, you would be filling that out if you're applying for an NIH internship.

342
00:33:12,834 --> 00:33:18,653
Um, yeah. I don't know if we want to take the time to do a similar activity now.

343
00:33:18,654 --> 00:33:25,614
Okay. We don't need to do that with a biographical sketch where you analyze facts by sketch.

344
00:33:26,484 --> 00:33:31,824
So what would be useful now for them to work on their resume? I actually only have a few minutes left.

345
00:33:31,824 --> 00:33:36,804
Okay, great. Yeah. So I'm happy to.

346
00:33:36,834 --> 00:33:44,634
You know, we have Dr. coming here. I'm happy to take any questions specifically or you all can use a little time to

347
00:33:44,634 --> 00:33:50,304
just like check out here on resonators and ask any questions or anything we've got.

348
00:33:50,684 --> 00:33:51,834
I'll see you in two weeks.
