1
00:00:02,740 --> 00:00:12,210
And so I think, you know, they should be.

2
00:00:26,370 --> 00:00:36,150
I think everybody didn't believe it.

3
00:00:38,430 --> 00:00:55,120
I didn't know. I went to the where you know, they were talking about the and.

4
00:00:56,840 --> 00:01:02,990
And then in the third year I was concerned.

5
00:01:03,740 --> 00:01:16,360
Yeah, that's my assumption for the first image in my social classes.

6
00:01:20,330 --> 00:01:28,220
Welcome. I wanted to call out I voted stickers designed by Ann Arbor Public School attendees.

7
00:01:29,270 --> 00:01:33,140
I think this one was like maybe middle school and that was a high schooler.

8
00:01:33,590 --> 00:01:37,370
So I hope everybody has already voted.

9
00:01:38,420 --> 00:01:42,050
Not that you have plans to do so, Linder said.

10
00:01:42,080 --> 00:01:48,469
Absentee voting is a little bit anticlimactic, although relieving of like, Oh, I voted like two weeks ago.

11
00:01:48,470 --> 00:01:58,280
Now I'm like, I want to go vote, but I don't care. So today we're going to talk about this idea of sort of interventions based on the school context.

12
00:01:58,280 --> 00:02:07,730
And so we'll zoom in on a few. And I think that for those of you considering, like school based interventions for intervention paper,

13
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:13,010
that that should give some some good fodder to think about.

14
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:20,930
And so that that that one that's like the lessons learned program thing.

15
00:02:20,930 --> 00:02:27,680
I think this reading, which is about like tobacco program eating healthy.

16
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:31,220
Project Healthy Schools Now. Project Healthy Schools and Planet Health.

17
00:02:32,180 --> 00:02:35,270
Project Healthy Schools is that program in Ann Arbor, basically?

18
00:02:35,990 --> 00:02:43,250
This is a good one for like just thinking through implementation stuff that you all want to talk about in that intervention piece.

19
00:02:43,550 --> 00:02:48,970
So, okay, so why do we want to focus on schools?

20
00:02:48,980 --> 00:02:53,180
Well, we know a lot about what happens when kids are in school.

21
00:02:53,180 --> 00:02:58,009
And again, of course, now we're going to know more because of COVID.

22
00:02:58,010 --> 00:03:09,350
But what we knew before COVID is that particularly for kids who are not getting the most input in the home setting sometimes,

23
00:03:09,830 --> 00:03:14,390
that they're sort of progressively falling behind across each school year.

24
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:18,320
And what's important to pay attention to here is like this summer timeline.

25
00:03:18,320 --> 00:03:24,710
So the summer appears in those solid bars among higher income students.

26
00:03:25,130 --> 00:03:31,910
What we see in the summer is like increased progress, like a faster rate of progress.

27
00:03:31,910 --> 00:03:38,239
So, you know, thinking about things like enrichment programs, you get to get a math tutor.

28
00:03:38,240 --> 00:03:45,440
You're doing these other things in school. You're doing lots of things that are increasing your literacy in this case.

29
00:03:47,780 --> 00:03:52,099
But for kids who are not getting that, they're actually falling behind under the summer.

30
00:03:52,100 --> 00:04:02,630
And has anybody in here are you guys familiar with how your school works or hasn't really had an experience with your own school in this class?

31
00:04:02,690 --> 00:04:12,200
Okay. Yeah, it's funny because sometimes some people have and it's interesting because I think that in general it's a really good model.

32
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:19,399
But in this country, at least, our systems such as they are not really set up for people who are doing year round school.

33
00:04:19,400 --> 00:04:23,360
So what year round school basically means it's not like school every day.

34
00:04:24,860 --> 00:04:29,000
And what I've talked to my kids about this, they're like, what, you're in school, that's horrifying.

35
00:04:29,570 --> 00:04:37,010
But what it is, is based it's kind of smoothes out these differences in the studies that have evaluated it, which we can imagine.

36
00:04:37,010 --> 00:04:41,239
Like that's a hard evaluation to do because communities that have year round school

37
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:44,959
differ and often they're private schools or charter schools or something like that.

38
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:56,270
But what they basically do is like just have sort of smaller breaks and or I'm sorry, larger breaks more frequently than we do during the school year.

39
00:04:56,390 --> 00:05:00,470
Like a typical school year has very few breaks of like longer than a week.

40
00:05:01,490 --> 00:05:10,250
So they'll do more like a unit and then like a 2 to 3 week break and then another unit of maybe, you know, 6 to 7 weeks and then a 2 to 3 week break.

41
00:05:10,790 --> 00:05:18,050
And so you end up on average like having the same sort of out of school time, but it doesn't come in these long chunks.

42
00:05:20,180 --> 00:05:24,799
If you're in a community that does year round school and you all of a sudden, you know,

43
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:30,770
have a 2 to 3 week break and there are no like camps or things for your kids to do during that 2 to 3 week break.

44
00:05:31,010 --> 00:05:32,930
You can see why that could be problematic for parents.

45
00:05:33,020 --> 00:05:41,419
So it's like it's a tricky thing when we're thinking about systems because you either all need to be in a year round school framework

46
00:05:41,420 --> 00:05:49,460
and like have other parent sort of structures set up for that year round school framework or all of our structures are camps and,

47
00:05:50,060 --> 00:05:55,220
you know, alternate activities, summer programs are set up relying on this long summer break.

48
00:05:55,430 --> 00:05:58,640
But this is the problem with the. Great. Okay.

49
00:05:59,450 --> 00:06:04,549
So what we also know, and this is like more recent so that those literacy gaps have been known for a long time,

50
00:06:04,550 --> 00:06:10,010
that people call it the summer slide and talk a lot about summer learning loss.

51
00:06:10,280 --> 00:06:20,420
But we've we've also seen increased evidence in studies to show that also hunger increases, physical activity decreases,

52
00:06:20,810 --> 00:06:28,190
all sorts of child health, things that we want to improve, basically take a dive during the summer.

53
00:06:29,180 --> 00:06:35,659
And so I would say like, hey, that should be pointing us all to think about like Summer as a great time for intervention.

54
00:06:35,660 --> 00:06:42,170
And of course, a lot of interventions happen during the summer. We think about like lots of different camps, lots of different out of school programs,

55
00:06:42,680 --> 00:06:49,820
great place for interventions, and they've been shown to be pretty effective as long as you implement them well.

56
00:06:52,700 --> 00:06:57,230
And so so one thing I would say we can do is think about summer.

57
00:06:57,500 --> 00:07:03,860
Yeah, focusing. I hate the word target, but I tend to slide into it, you know,

58
00:07:03,860 --> 00:07:10,700
focusing on summer as a time for intervention and then opportunity if you have kids who don't have stuff to do.

59
00:07:11,870 --> 00:07:13,309
One more thing about older kids.

60
00:07:13,310 --> 00:07:22,010
You can also think about like tying summer time interventions to other things that they might do, like job training and internships in time.

61
00:07:22,850 --> 00:07:31,430
Mm hmm. Is anybody in here worked with, like, summer programs, summer intervention programs, lunch programs in the summer, anything like that?

62
00:07:35,760 --> 00:07:41,110
Yeah, I work for human, but that's more like a yeah, that's like more like this.

63
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:45,600
Right. Kids getting sort of extra, extra help across the year.

64
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:48,960
But we did see like uptake in the summer. Yeah.

65
00:07:49,350 --> 00:07:52,770
Cause they offer them change programing there to offer kind of more.

66
00:07:54,520 --> 00:08:03,209
Um. I mean, it's, it's tricky because with those summer programs and like, I've written a lot of grants, for example,

67
00:08:03,210 --> 00:08:10,830
where we're proposing to do an intervention in the summer and it gets really hard with like evaluation, as with all things evaluation.

68
00:08:10,830 --> 00:08:16,860
But what's hard is that like you could have sort of a captive audience of kids who are there for x many weeks.

69
00:08:17,220 --> 00:08:24,420
But then I think from a like parent perspective, summer can be a time when it's sort of like a backup plan.

70
00:08:24,420 --> 00:08:28,499
And so like you get an opportunity to like go to Grandma's instead for a week or go do

71
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:33,090
something else for a week or like some other thing that you can but you can stick your kids.

72
00:08:33,900 --> 00:08:42,270
So I think that summer programs sometimes have like really tough attendance problems and for consistency and looking at like,

73
00:08:42,690 --> 00:08:47,820
what's the dosage of the program that the kid's got, it can be a lot harder with summer programs to do that.

74
00:08:49,080 --> 00:08:56,280
So that's just a like an evaluation note. What we did see during COVID is that kids who got and we've talked about this before,

75
00:08:56,280 --> 00:09:00,780
but kids who got school lunch during the year ended up needing to get it during the summer.

76
00:09:00,780 --> 00:09:08,340
So there was a lot of scrambling to try to get kids food during the summer because we know that hunger increases over the summer.

77
00:09:09,540 --> 00:09:16,330
Okay. So just to sort of step through this a little bit.

78
00:09:16,450 --> 00:09:22,479
Also for obesity is that rates of obesity in kids after early childhood.

79
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:31,240
So if we think about early childhood as a time when kids hopefully, presumably sometimes are in early childhood education settings and getting,

80
00:09:31,630 --> 00:09:41,020
you know, adequate nutrition, reduced screen time, etc., some motor time, those kids are in a more consistent environment for obesity prevention.

81
00:09:41,410 --> 00:09:52,870
But what we see for older kids who are remembered like a little bit less risk compared to early childhood for increased obesity rates in the summer,

82
00:09:52,870 --> 00:09:55,030
we see obesity increased obesity rates in those kids.

83
00:09:55,040 --> 00:10:04,240
So it's that difference between sort of there's a there's only a hypothesis people interested in this called the strong structured days hypothesis.

84
00:10:05,110 --> 00:10:08,410
You can think about what that, you know, looks like in the summer.

85
00:10:08,950 --> 00:10:11,409
We tend to have a lot less structured days, right?

86
00:10:11,410 --> 00:10:18,310
So that impacts our eating and our sleep and our media, our physical activity and all those things that we know are helpful to maintain.

87
00:10:18,670 --> 00:10:24,340
So that's like a summer versus school year difference.

88
00:10:25,570 --> 00:10:29,410
And just a note to focus on summer.

89
00:10:31,060 --> 00:10:34,360
Okay. And then this is also just turning to school.

90
00:10:34,360 --> 00:10:37,060
So this is all like within a school context or school year.

91
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:44,800
You know, I've noted this and pretty much about like there's a ton of things that we can do in the school context.

92
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:51,190
Right. And I think that the big challenge well what do you guys think that even challenges

93
00:10:51,490 --> 00:10:55,750
or could be doing things and trying to do all these things in a school context.

94
00:10:59,860 --> 00:11:04,240
Yeah. We talked about already. Like in schools, oftentimes it's like resources are limited.

95
00:11:04,360 --> 00:11:06,620
So it's like if you're trying to address all, you know,

96
00:11:06,670 --> 00:11:13,740
the teacher with a lot of things that are responsible to her, like me and you then trying to act like another.

97
00:11:14,710 --> 00:11:18,790
Responsible for something very difficult unless you provide support. Sure.

98
00:11:19,300 --> 00:11:24,640
And remember, in the preschool era, we talked about the incredible years of like 62 lessons over the course of the year.

99
00:11:24,820 --> 00:11:33,100
That's a lot. Right. And so with older kids, you can usually do more in less time because they're more cognitively advanced.

100
00:11:33,100 --> 00:11:37,180
They get it. But absolutely, teachers are taxed.

101
00:11:37,570 --> 00:11:47,650
And I just want to point out, school nurses are often like sort of tapped to or school social workers to do these types of programing efforts.

102
00:11:47,950 --> 00:11:50,830
But there's not even often a school nurse like.

103
00:11:51,760 --> 00:12:00,399
Constantly with the school, but it could be, you know, someone's on call, someone like rotates through and they're there certain days, etc.

104
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:05,049
So there's a lot that we're asking of schools, even though I would still advocate,

105
00:12:05,050 --> 00:12:08,570
like it's a great context for intervention, but you have to balance that.

106
00:12:08,570 --> 00:12:14,260
Like we're going to pop in and do our intervention with all these awesome interns or public health students or whoever we have at our disposal.

107
00:12:14,650 --> 00:12:17,170
And how do you, you know, make it sustainable for the school?

108
00:12:17,170 --> 00:12:25,540
So again, if if you guys are saying about school based type interventions in your papers, that's something to just sort of forecast.

109
00:12:25,720 --> 00:12:30,040
Like, I'm not expecting you guys to solve it because it's a really hard issue.

110
00:12:30,040 --> 00:12:39,010
But just note to note that, yeah, also like the actual drivers of a lot of this happens outside of school.

111
00:12:40,140 --> 00:12:44,460
Teachers and school nurses can't, you know, change what they're eating at home.

112
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:49,019
And you know what? They're not doing drugs. But like if they're doing you know what I'm saying?

113
00:12:49,020 --> 00:12:53,520
Like a lot of the stuff is outside of school so that for sure. Actual during.

114
00:12:54,840 --> 00:12:57,890
That control over. Absolutely. So.

115
00:12:57,900 --> 00:13:04,530
Right. All those social determinants of you, like I would say, know and love, but no one hate frame, all those social determinants,

116
00:13:04,530 --> 00:13:08,639
they're happening outside the school context as well as sometimes inside the school context.

117
00:13:08,640 --> 00:13:11,640
But certainly that's a really important point.

118
00:13:12,840 --> 00:13:19,230
And what's what's another like topical thing we've also touched on in this class just looking at that list.

119
00:13:22,910 --> 00:13:28,130
I hope it's not overly topical because it's election day, but it could be fun, right?

120
00:13:28,550 --> 00:13:32,510
Like who decides what topics sort of can be covered?

121
00:13:33,050 --> 00:13:38,660
And that's super important for all of us to like like really feel in our bones

122
00:13:38,660 --> 00:13:46,879
because these topics are controversial and they're controversial in school settings.

123
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:54,110
And so I think, again, just forecasting what may or may not happen with this and other elections going forward,

124
00:13:54,110 --> 00:14:01,250
there are lots of things on this list that might get really less possible to talk about in schools.

125
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:05,750
And so how else do we reach kids?

126
00:14:07,340 --> 00:14:11,930
You know, if they're if we don't reach them in school, it's really hard to do that.

127
00:14:12,830 --> 00:14:17,870
Yeah. And also, like if you're taking up class time to do these interventions,

128
00:14:17,870 --> 00:14:22,700
which is obviously really important, teachers could also feel like that they are assigning more homework.

129
00:14:23,140 --> 00:14:27,379
I know, especially as kids get to high school, they have pretty big homework loads.

130
00:14:27,380 --> 00:14:29,750
And so is that like, I don't know,

131
00:14:29,780 --> 00:14:35,300
it's a negative for the kids because they're more stressed after school cause they didn't have time to do their in working class.

132
00:14:35,510 --> 00:14:38,959
Yeah. Maybe they're doing homework and they're not doing other stuff, but.

133
00:14:38,960 --> 00:14:45,800
Yeah. Right. And you know, teachers sort of get judged on like how well their students are achieving.

134
00:14:45,800 --> 00:14:52,790
So we talked last time or two types ago about like those achievement test mechanisms and measures and how they're not perfect.

135
00:14:52,790 --> 00:14:58,280
And so yeah, if you carve away class time to do these other like social emotional learning activities,

136
00:14:58,640 --> 00:15:06,470
then you know what happens to math and reading basically, which is always a key question.

137
00:15:06,890 --> 00:15:10,640
And I think in as we get into these older grades, it's harder.

138
00:15:11,930 --> 00:15:17,810
In my opinion, it shouldn't be, but it is a bit harder than in the younger grades to argue for the importance of these,

139
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:24,530
because we see like these stark kind of achievement outcomes in math and reading that we

140
00:15:24,530 --> 00:15:29,960
don't we don't measure and little kids are expected to do in the same way that all kids are.

141
00:15:30,980 --> 00:15:34,639
Yeah, I don't know. Yeah. Yeah.

142
00:15:34,640 --> 00:15:41,090
So there's there's a lot to kind of consider in the schooling, schooling kind of context, but it is where the kids are.

143
00:15:41,090 --> 00:15:44,450
So we have to think about how we can get it to work.

144
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:49,999
Okay. And so one of the other the other reading, which I know is kind of old,

145
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:56,630
but it's it's really foundational and important is this term I academic effects.

146
00:15:57,020 --> 00:16:01,310
So do you guys can somebody say what that means?

147
00:16:02,500 --> 00:16:05,600
Yeah, it's like a vocabulary quiz. Yeah.

148
00:16:05,930 --> 00:16:11,629
Yeah. So, like, what we do is like the things that I'm thinking about in a medical context.

149
00:16:11,630 --> 00:16:17,120
But yeah, like sometimes the doctor cancer intervention itself would cause harm without meaning to,

150
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:21,290
but that's like antigenic coming from trying to help.

151
00:16:21,290 --> 00:16:24,760
But then you actually don't know exactly. That's like exactly.

152
00:16:24,770 --> 00:16:28,160
And it goes from this very medicalized framework, right?

153
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:34,580
But when our interventions harm again, we're not trying, but they actually cause harm.

154
00:16:35,020 --> 00:16:38,179
Caroline Yeah, thinking about it, like this context,

155
00:16:38,180 --> 00:16:46,040
like I wasn't talking about like if you're trying to target kids that they have like problem behaviors like bullying or like.

156
00:16:47,290 --> 00:16:51,450
That's like putting them all in a room together for just the train.

157
00:16:54,580 --> 00:16:58,150
And then, like, it had the opposite effect. They all get better at doing.

158
00:16:58,420 --> 00:17:03,040
Right. Already doing. Rather than, like, actually develop expertise.

159
00:17:04,050 --> 00:17:07,640
Yeah. Like with their programs preparing, for example.

160
00:17:07,670 --> 00:17:10,690
They do say they're. Yeah, yeah.

161
00:17:10,690 --> 00:17:18,090
Okay. We'll talk about their it's kind of it's just like, oh, but yeah, it's really true and it makes total sense, right?

162
00:17:18,100 --> 00:17:26,380
But that's kind of what I look for this older article question because they, they kind of unpack this and it's it's almost like,

163
00:17:28,090 --> 00:17:36,040
you know, I mean, it shouldn't be a surprise, but it sort of did come as a surprise to a lot of these behavior.

164
00:17:36,220 --> 00:17:47,080
Researchers like bad behavior, researchers like aggression, researchers who this time this is a big kind of researcher in this area was.

165
00:17:47,650 --> 00:17:54,670
Um. So this kind of iatrogenic effects thing and peer interventions and really behavioral interventions because.

166
00:17:54,670 --> 00:17:58,060
Right. We're not thinking about giving a medicine to somebody that could cause harm.

167
00:17:58,390 --> 00:18:02,530
We're thinking about doing a behavioral intervention, which is usually what we're talking about, public health.

168
00:18:02,530 --> 00:18:06,669
So we could, you know, it's always something that's important to think about.

169
00:18:06,670 --> 00:18:11,140
And this is sort of a a good example, this deviancy training, as they call it.

170
00:18:13,390 --> 00:18:21,400
And I think the other thing to think about with regard to these kinds of potential effects is that some of

171
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:27,550
these effects might sort of explain some of these null findings or mixed findings in the bullying literature,

172
00:18:27,880 --> 00:18:31,060
because there are a lot of mixed kind of findings in that literature.

173
00:18:31,060 --> 00:18:37,540
So that child trends report thing, I'd give you just sort of like for a reference of these are the things that we find that do work well,

174
00:18:37,540 --> 00:18:42,490
which are like up in school based climate change kind of bullying interventions.

175
00:18:43,060 --> 00:18:48,430
But these interpersonal dynamics can be really hard to work with.

176
00:18:49,780 --> 00:18:58,780
And so some ways that we can kind of combat this is if you guys are familiar with that term theory of change and no, all HBC students are.

177
00:18:58,780 --> 00:19:06,519
But it's basically like, what is my hypothesis about why this behavior would be changing in my intervention that I'm doing right?

178
00:19:06,520 --> 00:19:09,969
Like, what's the mechanism of the behavior change that's happening?

179
00:19:09,970 --> 00:19:17,799
So you have to kind of know what that is. So you're not acting on the wrong one, for example, and then you want to evaluate both the implementation,

180
00:19:17,800 --> 00:19:22,810
like how good was it, how were the interventionists? Were they jerks, intervention for fidelity?

181
00:19:22,810 --> 00:19:27,400
Did they have high dosage that kids come to the intervention? Did parents come to the intervention?

182
00:19:28,360 --> 00:19:36,729
And so you need to know that stuff in order to say like while this intervention was had positive effects was no like it was a wash or had

183
00:19:36,730 --> 00:19:45,459
I after jack facts and then create logic models based on all of those things and then also and then we'll get to this with there too.

184
00:19:45,460 --> 00:19:53,200
But you need to share the results. So like if you did that awesome study, if you had great implementation and it had adaptogenic effects,

185
00:19:53,470 --> 00:19:58,630
you need to like let the world know because people shouldn't be continuing to do that intervention.

186
00:20:00,820 --> 00:20:08,050
Okay. So if people have been like either worked with kids or in school based programs,

187
00:20:09,130 --> 00:20:15,730
anything that if anybody has done that, has there been anything or just like with kids in general,

188
00:20:15,730 --> 00:20:27,640
what kinds of things that you've talked about, this deviancy training and the bad behaviors or aggressive behaviors or, you know, sneaking around?

189
00:20:28,210 --> 00:20:30,940
There's anything else you guys can think about.

190
00:20:32,010 --> 00:20:42,450
In terms of believers that might be meeker, like family also not just like say, but if you like, go home and share something with your family.

191
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:46,350
Very close to it and have, like, this kind.

192
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:52,800
Yeah. And actually, well, something I didn't even mention, but like, if, if a child might, like,

193
00:20:53,620 --> 00:20:58,750
do an intervention at school and then come home and share with the family and the family, like negatively responds to that?

194
00:20:58,760 --> 00:21:01,510
Yes, absolutely. That's a dynamic that could be true as well.

195
00:21:04,390 --> 00:21:12,220
Other kinds of behaviors that you think might be vulnerable to androgenic effects like child health, behaviors that we might be trying to improve.

196
00:21:13,350 --> 00:21:17,559
Yeah. Caroline. Thinking about this one more like high school or middle school.

197
00:21:17,560 --> 00:21:22,690
But I do think it's tricky with, like, kind of about, like, safe sex and like.

198
00:21:23,370 --> 00:21:31,469
Well, it's good to do it in school. I do think that there can be like and I add to that the fact that students are like laughing

199
00:21:31,470 --> 00:21:37,770
about or like it's seen as like eating or like if there is a reference to like sex,

200
00:21:37,770 --> 00:21:44,790
it's not like straight sex to like how other students react to that could negatively impact like students.

201
00:21:46,600 --> 00:21:52,620
Twitter or anything like that. So yeah, I think it's like a really kind.

202
00:21:55,800 --> 00:21:57,420
I think that's a really good example.

203
00:21:57,420 --> 00:22:06,090
And there's so much to sort of like instant, you know, judgment or commentary or like stray remarks that could be really impactful.

204
00:22:06,100 --> 00:22:09,270
And like you said, particularly about teen teen time.

205
00:22:11,100 --> 00:22:18,810
Another place we see this a lot and that's a particular pretty specific literature but is eating disorders.

206
00:22:19,410 --> 00:22:29,399
And so people who are eating disorder clinics really talk about doing more like family based individual therapies compared to group therapies,

207
00:22:29,400 --> 00:22:33,540
because that's a place where you do see a lot of this side effects of the group.

208
00:22:33,810 --> 00:22:40,290
Right. So that's another example. But I always like to point that out because I think we need to, you know,

209
00:22:40,290 --> 00:22:46,740
be aware and honest and think about how our interventions might might not do what they're hoping it would do.

210
00:22:47,850 --> 00:22:51,630
Okay. So with that, we could talk about there.

211
00:22:52,950 --> 00:23:03,479
So how many of you guys like a show of hands, if anybody went through a dare program, like to their knowledge or are people.

212
00:23:03,480 --> 00:23:07,550
Okay, okay. You like about that? Okay. It's interesting because again, like,

213
00:23:07,800 --> 00:23:16,860
I think there's this kind of cohort effect as we find out more about this program and it didn't super work and how it changes over time.

214
00:23:16,860 --> 00:23:25,560
So I think it is the the version of DARE that is now implemented is a little bit different, but there are parts of it that continue.

215
00:23:26,610 --> 00:23:36,749
So just as a like little bit of history for dare so basically that their curriculum was being really piloted with

216
00:23:36,750 --> 00:23:47,129
some middle school middle school kids by teachers and it wasn't necessarily like a ready for primetime curriculum.

217
00:23:47,130 --> 00:23:55,440
It was sort of in the pilot stages. But then it got picked up and widely disseminated by the Los Angeles Police Department,

218
00:23:57,150 --> 00:24:07,350
and this was also in the nineties when it was just an era of great power of the police department and a great controversy over that police department,

219
00:24:07,350 --> 00:24:16,979
too. So the format of their you'll notice like it was piloted initially it was teachers talking about drug abuse,

220
00:24:16,980 --> 00:24:24,210
resistance, education to middle schoolers, but then they switched it to have a different interventionist.

221
00:24:24,660 --> 00:24:29,040
And so in Dare that was sort of like widely disseminated and rolled out.

222
00:24:29,730 --> 00:24:42,710
The curriculum was delivered by police officers instead of teachers and the general, you know, 17 lessons, which I think is also pretty significant.

223
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:46,230
Like that's a lot of classroom time, 17 lessons.

224
00:24:47,610 --> 00:24:50,579
And then this is sort of the, the, the model.

225
00:24:50,580 --> 00:25:01,850
So like the police is the expert and you want to build refusal skills and these kids and you know share a lot of the this and

226
00:25:01,970 --> 00:25:10,530
information heavy sharing so people that have like gone through dare or if you remember anything about it or have reflected on it,

227
00:25:10,530 --> 00:25:18,990
does that sound familiar? Does that sound like similar to what you may remember, may, may or may not remember about that program?

228
00:25:20,220 --> 00:25:25,200
I mean, yeah, I mean, I barely remember when I was in elementary school.

229
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:28,680
I do remember that. I feel like I vaguely remember some police element in it.

230
00:25:28,890 --> 00:25:32,430
We also I definitely remember this feels like an art project related to it.

231
00:25:33,090 --> 00:25:35,669
I don't know. I don't know what the program is now.

232
00:25:35,670 --> 00:25:46,230
I remember, but I do remember we have like a big presentation of like everyone's art, no school about just saying no.

233
00:25:46,630 --> 00:25:54,450
Yeah. So that's like, right. And also like an attempt to like expand the throughout the curriculum which, you know, you kind of want to do.

234
00:25:54,450 --> 00:25:58,840
If it's going to take 17 lessons anyway, you might as well build it in like through an art program.

235
00:25:58,860 --> 00:26:06,000
Like you could see the, the rationale for that what others like I think I remember yeah.

236
00:26:06,140 --> 00:26:11,430
Currently experiencing this is similar to yours Jack. We had like an art component as well.

237
00:26:11,430 --> 00:26:16,200
We all had to make our own poster and kind of like present it at your graduation.

238
00:26:16,350 --> 00:26:20,340
Um, right. I think I was in fifth grade when we did that.

239
00:26:20,850 --> 00:26:26,100
And, um, I think the public service focused on like our,

240
00:26:27,390 --> 00:26:34,400
our favorite early is the lesson that we really enjoyed the most and then kind of making a poster about like a date.

241
00:26:34,440 --> 00:26:45,390
I think sometimes I like alcohol consumption, so the danger of that, different skills that we learned how to resist that, say no to that.

242
00:26:46,740 --> 00:26:50,760
And I present that for our parents generation ceremony.

243
00:26:52,900 --> 00:26:56,490
So, um. Yeah. No, go ahead.

244
00:26:56,520 --> 00:26:59,320
I was going to say, yeah, I don't remember the party thing,

245
00:26:59,340 --> 00:27:07,079
but I just remember very specifically like thinking as a child, even when I was a kid, how they like to play.

246
00:27:07,080 --> 00:27:13,409
Like we were basically like everything like cocaine and heroin and they were like, do not do this.

247
00:27:13,410 --> 00:27:21,360
People die, you know? So I remember just being like even in middle school, I remember being like, This is not true.

248
00:27:22,710 --> 00:27:27,010
I'm a little scared. Yeah. I just remember being like, Why are they telling us to go?

249
00:27:28,950 --> 00:27:32,579
Which is a very stark message.

250
00:27:32,580 --> 00:27:39,570
Right, very stark messaging. And it's interesting. I love like the poster creation or the like health communication tools.

251
00:27:43,320 --> 00:27:49,250
Yeah, I know how to make a song for her song.

252
00:27:49,350 --> 00:27:52,410
And I don't write a song like Don't Do Drugs. I don't know.

253
00:27:52,950 --> 00:27:59,940
Some other songs and cause like this, they're, they're like, huh?

254
00:28:00,570 --> 00:28:05,430
Well, it was a big deal. Oh, yeah. Individual songs.

255
00:28:05,550 --> 00:28:08,460
No, me and like a couple of, like, class songs. Okay.

256
00:28:08,580 --> 00:28:15,270
But I mean, like, there's like a stark graduation recital thing, and it's very anxiety provoking.

257
00:28:15,800 --> 00:28:19,410
Yeah, I still, like, cringe thinking about it. Right.

258
00:28:19,740 --> 00:28:25,110
It sounds very good. It's working, right? So, like, it's but it's still like it's got staying power, right?

259
00:28:25,140 --> 00:28:29,540
Like this. This program is definitely of around.

260
00:28:29,550 --> 00:28:36,830
So the kind of start of the eighties really had I mean, you think about like 20 million elementary school kids.

261
00:28:36,840 --> 00:28:44,490
Like that's a lot of kids and that's like high uptake and dissemination, like all these things that we really want with our programs, right?

262
00:28:44,760 --> 00:28:50,069
Like, wow, that's great. The other thing is, it was funded.

263
00:28:50,070 --> 00:28:55,740
It was sort of anointed as a program that was going to be helpful with the Drug Free Drug Free Schools Act.

264
00:28:58,200 --> 00:29:04,560
And so it was kind of a high cost program or symbolic in how to pay for these police educators to come in.

265
00:29:05,580 --> 00:29:10,650
And so it got a lot of funding. And I don't know if people recognize that as.

266
00:29:13,950 --> 00:29:18,089
Nancy Reagan. Nancy Reagan. Yeah. And she does have her slogan underneath.

267
00:29:18,090 --> 00:29:22,020
But yeah. So that was that. That was the thing.

268
00:29:22,030 --> 00:29:29,819
Right. So she was in the eighties. Nancy Reagan her whole thing was just say no.

269
00:29:29,820 --> 00:29:34,260
It was very aligned with DARE as a philosophy.

270
00:29:35,280 --> 00:29:39,299
And I would say like that's pretty high face validity.

271
00:29:39,300 --> 00:29:45,300
Like you want kids to not do drugs, but instead a good theory of change.

272
00:29:45,300 --> 00:29:54,330
Like unclear. Like it's not clear what the theory of change was there and just assuming, you know, kind of it's all the same.

273
00:29:54,330 --> 00:30:00,330
Like if we show kids it's dangerous, they won't do it is maybe not the best three things.

274
00:30:02,280 --> 00:30:06,929
You know, kids may be skeptical. Kids may have had other experiences.

275
00:30:06,930 --> 00:30:11,610
Kids may be, you know, depending on like, again, the temperament of kids.

276
00:30:11,610 --> 00:30:15,360
Some kid might be like, ooh, that sounds like really fun and wild. I'm going to try that.

277
00:30:15,360 --> 00:30:24,390
So lots of different reasons why that may or may not may not work, but that was kind of the extent of the theory of change for that program.

278
00:30:26,160 --> 00:30:33,780
So also thinking about evaluation, they didn't do too much evaluation of deer before.

279
00:30:33,780 --> 00:30:39,600
It was like taken up and widely disseminated. So that's another place where I think it's like a cautionary tale.

280
00:30:41,010 --> 00:30:44,670
And they also here I'll just pull this all up. I'll talk through this one.

281
00:30:45,510 --> 00:30:53,370
But they also basically tried to block, like, independent evaluations of it because everybody was already so invested in it,

282
00:30:53,370 --> 00:31:01,710
sort of school systems, federal government was all sort of invested in funding there and disseminating that widely.

283
00:31:02,550 --> 00:31:08,560
And so they really didn't want to know. It were like, don't tell us if it doesn't work, which is problematic, right?

284
00:31:08,580 --> 00:31:12,870
Because we want to know our values, this work if they're causing adaptogenic effects.

285
00:31:12,870 --> 00:31:22,650
And so here I'm American general public health in 1994 so it's been like rolled out for, you know, over a decade at this point.

286
00:31:23,160 --> 00:31:26,819
What they found is they did a pretty good, you know, meta analysis.

287
00:31:26,820 --> 00:31:29,790
So like combined a lot of different studies to look at overall impact.

288
00:31:30,210 --> 00:31:36,330
And they found that there will increase knowledge about drugs and alcohol, but it really didn't change behavior.

289
00:31:36,330 --> 00:31:44,430
So it's like flat for behavior, you know, social skills, there was like the hint of an effect, but I don't think that was significant.

290
00:31:44,430 --> 00:31:48,569
And then really this column is knowledge that you guys can't, you know, read.

291
00:31:48,570 --> 00:31:53,850
It's like knowledge, attitudes, social skills, self-esteem, police and drug use.

292
00:31:55,200 --> 00:32:04,679
And so they had no impact really on drug use, self-esteem, which were sort of two things they were trying to change in the program and they increased.

293
00:32:04,680 --> 00:32:10,170
I think it was knowledge about police a little bit, but not significant social skills a little bit, but not significant.

294
00:32:10,590 --> 00:32:16,979
And then a lot of knowledge around drug drugs and alcohol.

295
00:32:16,980 --> 00:32:22,440
So important to know, but like not really changing the use behavior.

296
00:32:24,360 --> 00:32:34,019
And then as they kind of continued, this was sort of, I think like a little bit of a wake up call for like the dare company or whatever at that point.

297
00:32:34,020 --> 00:32:40,290
But then the original developers also evaluated and found non-significant or adaptogenic results.

298
00:32:41,310 --> 00:32:45,900
And then it sort of prompted this surgeon general report to say, Oh, you know what,

299
00:32:46,110 --> 00:32:52,709
before we roll out programs really big time in schools, we should make sure there's evidence behind them, more evidence behind them.

300
00:32:52,710 --> 00:32:58,990
And it's not just like they sounded like a good idea and then dare wasn't included there so others

301
00:32:59,100 --> 00:33:07,889
other programs and I'll say like reformatted their have kind of because there so I don't know

302
00:33:07,890 --> 00:33:15,209
I think it's like a two is that it's a double edged sword is is that the phrase so like it's

303
00:33:15,210 --> 00:33:20,850
known but now it's also increasingly known for not working and maybe being kind of causing harm.

304
00:33:21,900 --> 00:33:26,280
And so people have kind of done different types of skill,

305
00:33:26,520 --> 00:33:33,570
skills focused programing that's more about like social competence and like building up other social skills,

306
00:33:34,590 --> 00:33:38,909
refusal skills included, but not only like just say no, right?

307
00:33:38,910 --> 00:33:42,000
So they're a little more engaged.

308
00:33:43,470 --> 00:33:47,100
And I think they also moved it.

309
00:33:47,250 --> 00:33:55,200
They've like moved it around in terms of age. So some elementary school that we heard about and some mostly in middle school.

310
00:33:58,230 --> 00:34:04,530
Okay. Any other, any other dear, dear thoughts or recollections?

311
00:34:04,530 --> 00:34:08,879
Yeah. Like this. They're just not done anymore.

312
00:34:08,880 --> 00:34:12,840
Like under the name dare I see 21? Like I definitely took their.

313
00:34:13,500 --> 00:34:17,450
Yes. After that. So it's just like not like improvement program in the high school.

314
00:34:18,400 --> 00:34:21,690
I think probably. Oh, good to know.

315
00:34:22,470 --> 00:34:25,550
Yeah. And I think that's a they the name recognition.

316
00:34:25,560 --> 00:34:30,240
It's sort of like this like how how knowledge systems change really slowly.

317
00:34:30,240 --> 00:34:34,379
And we talk about, you know, an intervention research like or implementation science.

318
00:34:34,380 --> 00:34:43,320
It takes right like 17 years from like a result to show promising effects to like implementation in practice.

319
00:34:43,320 --> 00:34:47,760
And so here dare was hugely disseminated.

320
00:34:47,760 --> 00:34:54,450
But this idea of like implementing something that isn't working well is sort of a lot harder once you have this like by the name recognition.

321
00:34:54,450 --> 00:34:59,430
So even if people are saying, oh, you know what, there is not evidence base in this report came out.

322
00:35:00,720 --> 00:35:08,380
Not all schools change their practice. Yeah, I, I think that my school had one of these reformatted.

323
00:35:08,550 --> 00:35:15,360
Yeah. Because we had high school students come in and elementary school needed something like this.

324
00:35:15,360 --> 00:35:19,140
Gets in the decision. Make the middle of that. Mm hmm.

325
00:35:20,430 --> 00:35:24,300
Did that seem better than making a song? Kind of, most of all, based on the song?

326
00:35:24,650 --> 00:35:31,410
Oh, right. It took the blockbuster faster. I mean, it's interesting to think about like that.

327
00:35:31,800 --> 00:35:34,310
We have this infrastructure we bought in, we put out.

328
00:35:34,380 --> 00:35:41,700
There's probably some denial on the school's part, like, gosh, you know, this was our big approach and you know, everybody's trained in it.

329
00:35:41,700 --> 00:35:44,399
Make do we dump it doing what we do now.

330
00:35:44,400 --> 00:35:52,710
So there's a lot to sort of consider for schools as they're, you know, spending limited resources on this programing.

331
00:35:53,400 --> 00:36:00,360
Um, so yeah, it's it again, tricky space and it's like ripe for projecting effects, right?

332
00:36:00,400 --> 00:36:08,130
Drug use and high schoolers. But there's, there's different ways that they've tried to change the program.

333
00:36:09,060 --> 00:36:16,200
So I love this little like graphic, but basically like how do we avoid this kind of like miss stuff, right?

334
00:36:17,250 --> 00:36:25,740
So that we aren't like accidentally giving our message, just do drugs or trying to give the message to call to do drugs.

335
00:36:26,160 --> 00:36:30,840
And you kind of switch it over time. It's called the drugs treadmill.

336
00:36:31,560 --> 00:36:34,990
Um, yeah. And it's, it is funny.

337
00:36:35,010 --> 00:36:36,870
I mean, yeah, just as a kid.

338
00:36:36,900 --> 00:36:46,860
Nancy Reagan and then Tipper Gore came along and like, had music, like, put controls on explicit music, stuff like, come on, Tipper Gore anyway.

339
00:36:46,860 --> 00:36:49,620
But it's just interesting you sort of messaging from the top, right?

340
00:36:49,620 --> 00:36:59,060
So here I think the key is this idea of really focusing more on those mechanisms, mechanisms of change, right?

341
00:36:59,100 --> 00:37:00,600
So like thinking about behavior change,

342
00:37:00,600 --> 00:37:07,020
what actually prompts behavior change and how do we do it and how do we then design interventions to address that?

343
00:37:07,020 --> 00:37:12,419
And so also per one comment, like a lot of these are contextual factors, right?

344
00:37:12,420 --> 00:37:19,290
And so can't we do things in the contextual lives of people who are facing these behavioral choices?

345
00:37:21,600 --> 00:37:31,590
And so I think we've you know, and as comes out of this newest surgeon general's report or like more recent one on addiction 2016 compared to 2001,

346
00:37:32,040 --> 00:37:37,229
it's gone beyond evidence based. And it's saying like, hey, guys, there's a whole big context out there.

347
00:37:37,230 --> 00:37:38,880
We really need to pay attention to that.

348
00:37:40,140 --> 00:37:47,310
And then the other thing here is that really thinking about addiction as a disease and as a pediatric disease,

349
00:37:47,310 --> 00:37:54,360
that really wasn't something that was kind of in the in like the Nancy Reagan just say no framework.

350
00:37:54,840 --> 00:37:59,489
It was that, you know, people vary in terms of their susceptibility to this.

351
00:37:59,490 --> 00:38:08,400
And so that wasn't really that's not really addressable if you're if you're only tool is the same health tool or framework.

352
00:38:09,720 --> 00:38:14,970
And so we know also that, you know, substance use alters brain development.

353
00:38:15,390 --> 00:38:27,780
Um, you know as I was think about this so as like increasing marijuana legislation happens, how is that affecting youth drug use?

354
00:38:27,780 --> 00:38:32,720
And then also how is that affecting, you know, prenatal exposures?

355
00:38:32,730 --> 00:38:42,540
And so I just think that's another like relatively unknown, probably big looming set of health considerations that we need to think about.

356
00:38:44,370 --> 00:38:50,250
I think another important thing here with switching from just sort of the just say no framework to thinking about how do we actually,

357
00:38:50,580 --> 00:38:57,840
you know, prevent drug use in kids is that we have to give them alternate strategies.

358
00:38:57,850 --> 00:39:01,709
We have to think about like, okay, I can see why you might want to use drugs.

359
00:39:01,710 --> 00:39:07,050
That's really stressful day you're having or whatever it is. But how about these other stress management strategies?

360
00:39:07,050 --> 00:39:12,530
Right. So that's another big area of focus. And then the other thing is this idea with Linked.

361
00:39:12,630 --> 00:39:20,730
To the brain development piece is that if you can delay extensive drug use, even cannabis,

362
00:39:21,330 --> 00:39:27,600
until you're after a certain age, till you're older than like your mid to late teens,

363
00:39:28,530 --> 00:39:39,150
that is really beneficial because your brain development is a little more substantially more complete than if you're like 12 to 14 years old.

364
00:39:39,930 --> 00:39:45,300
And so the studies that they have really done on that question, that sort of developmental question,

365
00:39:45,930 --> 00:39:55,290
do show some really bad effects, like sort of prior to age 14, prior to age 16 in terms of heavy cannabis use.

366
00:39:57,150 --> 00:40:02,520
So that's a really important tool. And then the idea of sort of screening kids.

367
00:40:02,520 --> 00:40:06,240
So again, not a just signal from framework, but like, okay,

368
00:40:06,660 --> 00:40:12,870
this is happening and let's see who it's happening for and see if we can get them connected to services as opposed to saying,

369
00:40:13,800 --> 00:40:18,660
don't ever do it, just say no. You know, that's all we're going to give you.

370
00:40:19,080 --> 00:40:26,040
So I think there's positive ways that we have evolved in our thinking around this challenging issue,

371
00:40:26,550 --> 00:40:33,600
and it's going to continue to be a challenging issue because of this ongoing context.

372
00:40:35,670 --> 00:40:40,800
So I think the message here is also like, you know, develop and implement evidence based programs.

373
00:40:41,850 --> 00:40:47,670
And the caveat to that, I would say to evidence based programs is like evidence based for whom?

374
00:40:47,820 --> 00:40:51,540
So who have they been tested with and in what contexts have they been tested?

375
00:40:51,570 --> 00:40:59,250
And so that's like, I think the next wave of what's really, really important to think about and that can help explain like,

376
00:40:59,250 --> 00:41:02,850
oh, wow, this was an evidence based, evidence based program.

377
00:41:03,660 --> 00:41:08,100
Why didn't it work for this new population? Well, it wasn't evidence based for that population.

378
00:41:08,100 --> 00:41:10,889
So maybe we should try it out in that population, you know,

379
00:41:10,890 --> 00:41:17,040
and you can't always we don't have the resources to do that for like every single program we do.

380
00:41:17,040 --> 00:41:24,180
But it's always an important thing to think about and to help contextualize results that may not be successful.

381
00:41:24,450 --> 00:41:28,560
Right. So I think that's a critical piece.

382
00:41:31,650 --> 00:41:35,729
And then here, I'll just talk a little bit more about vaping and substances.

383
00:41:35,730 --> 00:41:40,290
But what we know is that, again, that's Election Day.

384
00:41:40,290 --> 00:41:50,219
So like it's going to become legal in even more states and not just up the availability, which is sort of the point of legalization.

385
00:41:50,220 --> 00:42:00,480
And I get it. But we talked a little bit and there was just an article that came out this morning about toddler poisonings and gummies.

386
00:42:01,050 --> 00:42:12,410
And so just thinking about like prevention in terms of both unintentional pieces as well as the formats that it's in now, the cannabis comes in.

387
00:42:12,420 --> 00:42:18,690
So there are these THC intensive formats that can really unlike in prior eras.

388
00:42:18,690 --> 00:42:24,270
And I think this is where something like Dare or prior versions of programs may fall short.

389
00:42:26,130 --> 00:42:33,090
It's much more possible to like have an overdose situation than it was even ten years ago.

390
00:42:34,350 --> 00:42:40,170
We also know that, like I said, early use is more damaging to the brain and a current it creates further dependance.

391
00:42:41,610 --> 00:42:45,450
And we also know that I would say like we don't know.

392
00:42:45,840 --> 00:42:56,160
We know far from everything about vaping, but we do know that it's a lot more common, easy, high, double appealing, used by youth.

393
00:42:57,540 --> 00:43:07,889
And so it's just important to keep in mind and we also know, of course, that we are in a lot of overlapping mental health crisis crises.

394
00:43:07,890 --> 00:43:13,020
And so this is a really common and increasing coping mechanism.

395
00:43:16,260 --> 00:43:24,390
Any thoughts, any thoughts on like vaping and other other things on here?

396
00:43:26,410 --> 00:43:36,810
Yeah, I think it's interesting that you bring up availability because I was a freshman in undergrad when they changed the smoking from 18 to 21.

397
00:43:37,620 --> 00:43:43,670
So all of my friends were 18 and to go up to the gas station and by then they

398
00:43:43,820 --> 00:43:47,820
knew that they changed that in the middle of the year and they were all frantic,

399
00:43:47,820 --> 00:43:54,080
like, how am I going to get there? So it worked for a little bit until they found other ways to get in.

400
00:43:54,090 --> 00:44:00,569
Yeah. And that it's kind of like alcohol, too. Like you have minors who have big ideas, people who will buy food.

401
00:44:00,570 --> 00:44:04,229
There's always a right. It's going to be the same as this do.

402
00:44:04,230 --> 00:44:12,440
It already has been like that with names. But just like seeing it firsthand, like people going frantic about having access to it because they.

403
00:44:12,990 --> 00:44:22,740
Because like I was, it depended on where but just how much of their time and stress it caused them just to have access to a substance like that.

404
00:44:22,860 --> 00:44:26,280
Yeah. Yeah. Right. And absolutely, as you say,

405
00:44:26,280 --> 00:44:32,309
like being more dependent from an earlier age is going to lead to more of that and putting

406
00:44:32,310 --> 00:44:38,370
on external constraints and policy changes like it's always possible to get around them.

407
00:44:38,910 --> 00:44:41,760
It's always possible, but it takes a little more effort. All right.

408
00:44:41,760 --> 00:44:48,390
So you're either going to get the people who are super motivated for lots of different reasons to get it.

409
00:44:48,930 --> 00:44:54,540
But you're going to hopefully from a public health framework, just provide enough of a barrier for for,

410
00:44:54,840 --> 00:44:59,790
again, temperament and context and opportunity for kids who may not who may say,

411
00:44:59,790 --> 00:45:07,889
you know what, I don't need to take the risk or go through the hassle or the expense or whatever of getting a fake I.D. so that I can do this.

412
00:45:07,890 --> 00:45:10,920
So I just won't. And I wait and I'll, like, protect my brain.

413
00:45:14,610 --> 00:45:17,610
Yeah. Great point. Other thoughts? Yeah.

414
00:45:17,880 --> 00:45:22,500
You guys are, like, living through this very interesting window. I am. I know where.

415
00:45:22,560 --> 00:45:28,440
Yeah. Yeah. I also think I mean, just from my personal experience, I remember in high school, like, nobody knew.

416
00:45:29,190 --> 00:45:33,590
I mean, I feel like we could have probably figured out, figured that it wasn't great.

417
00:45:33,600 --> 00:45:34,469
We've been living great.

418
00:45:34,470 --> 00:45:44,760
But I feel like when you were like drooling or being like it was kind of marketed as like not that totally an alternative to cigarets,

419
00:45:44,760 --> 00:45:47,970
which it is like if you're addicted to Cigarets and like to, like, you know,

420
00:45:48,120 --> 00:45:53,010
or something, you know, I also just think of like the responsibility of the, like.

421
00:45:54,420 --> 00:46:02,549
Company is created, whether it's true or, I don't know, the other unicorn like creating like flavored pods.

422
00:46:02,550 --> 00:46:12,930
And I know there's been a lot of lawsuits like that, but yeah, clearly trying to target and trying to get like, not only like you're addicted to the.

423
00:46:13,810 --> 00:46:20,090
Like substance, but also the like. They were totally.

424
00:46:20,120 --> 00:46:23,360
I mean, there's so many things, right? And it's been so rapid.

425
00:46:24,680 --> 00:46:28,909
And again, like, you guys are in this very interesting window developmentally.

426
00:46:28,910 --> 00:46:33,400
And I think like people kind of, you know, broadly speaking, people, you know,

427
00:46:33,410 --> 00:46:41,450
kind of before and after you in like age on average are going to have different have had or are having different experiences.

428
00:46:42,270 --> 00:46:49,020
Yeah, you know, like when I was in high school, there wasn't a thing or anything, but my brother was only a couple of years younger.

429
00:46:49,020 --> 00:46:54,440
It like overtook everything. That's like a huge topic of conversation now.

430
00:46:55,970 --> 00:47:03,440
And it's also true like thinking about like that high school context of, you know, parent awareness was like zero.

431
00:47:03,890 --> 00:47:07,630
And then it was just so easy to kind of hide from like maps of the US.

432
00:47:07,640 --> 00:47:12,740
BE And all this sort of went back when people used to have USB drives, which now like why would someone have that?

433
00:47:12,800 --> 00:47:18,020
You know what, it's like a dead giveaway. But yeah, yeah, exactly.

434
00:47:18,090 --> 00:47:22,980
And recovering myself. So I have a different angle of hearing that.

435
00:47:22,990 --> 00:47:30,319
It's it's been interesting over the years, like seeing actually the increase in people coming in with like cannabis addicts and

436
00:47:30,320 --> 00:47:35,600
especially a very common thing that I've seen through it is for anxiety and social anxiety.

437
00:47:36,020 --> 00:47:41,030
And so seeing that anxiety and social anxiety increase like in high schoolers like

438
00:47:41,480 --> 00:47:46,580
to be able to have like cannabis like more available I think is interesting.

439
00:47:46,580 --> 00:47:52,280
And it also I think the change and but I don't even think it's quite there really though but like before,

440
00:47:52,280 --> 00:47:59,689
like a lot of people were like, oh, you can't get addicted to like marijuana and but like now more and more like in treatment,

441
00:47:59,690 --> 00:48:04,280
like you see people especially young, especially young people, um,

442
00:48:05,090 --> 00:48:10,400
with addiction that cannabis or marijuana, it's called so many different things back in my days.

443
00:48:11,130 --> 00:48:16,130
Yeah. Yeah, absolutely. Absolutely. And I think some of that is this as well.

444
00:48:16,130 --> 00:48:22,459
Like back in my day, it was like very different. And I think it's it's really true.

445
00:48:22,460 --> 00:48:29,870
It's a different product and like it's more pure, but it's more concentrated and intense.

446
00:48:29,870 --> 00:48:33,139
And so I think that that's partly leading to a lot of these shifts.

447
00:48:33,140 --> 00:48:38,630
Yeah. So an interesting thing that's happening sort of like along that.

448
00:48:42,600 --> 00:48:51,389
Most of the marijuana is the way that drugs like ketamine and other psychoactive

449
00:48:51,390 --> 00:49:01,110
substances are starting to be used as treatment for mental health conditions.

450
00:49:01,140 --> 00:49:09,090
Yeah. Yeah. Even though we don't have much research really, on the long term effects of these things.

451
00:49:11,080 --> 00:49:14,640
I think it's just sort of like interesting. Yeah. I don't know.

452
00:49:14,650 --> 00:49:19,390
Like, doors are like, I wanna hang out. Yeah, I think doors are really flying open and.

453
00:49:19,690 --> 00:49:21,519
Yeah. And psychedelics as well. Right.

454
00:49:21,520 --> 00:49:28,479
And people talk about like, do you need sort of the trip element of psychedelics to actually make these psychological changes?

455
00:49:28,480 --> 00:49:32,559
And they're really, they're actively testing them like some folks here use them.

456
00:49:32,560 --> 00:49:41,230
There's like a whole center at I'm on a poster with this woman and she's like based I think think it's Ohio State actually anyway.

457
00:49:41,230 --> 00:49:46,209
But it was like I was like, oh, that's like your center is like Psychedelic Research Center or whatever.

458
00:49:46,210 --> 00:49:51,490
And it was like, wow, this is like you said, doors are flying open and things are really changing quickly.

459
00:49:52,360 --> 00:50:03,310
And I think because this is all changed so fast and it's just much more common, more broadly accepted than in the Nancy Reagan era.

460
00:50:04,510 --> 00:50:11,980
And people are kind of growing up and being used to it as more of a common occurrence and perhaps more accepted.

461
00:50:12,310 --> 00:50:18,550
It's going to be very interesting to like watch this space and see where it goes in terms of mental health treatments.

462
00:50:19,840 --> 00:50:24,760
Because I think we know, you know, they are psychoactive substances.

463
00:50:25,540 --> 00:50:31,930
And so that also means from a treatment perspective, if you can harness that psychoactive ness,

464
00:50:32,500 --> 00:50:36,430
you could have a lot of power over anxiety and other things.

465
00:50:36,430 --> 00:50:47,890
Yeah. So secret areas like it's going to be years before there starts to be like a push or insurance to cover.

466
00:50:49,480 --> 00:50:53,050
Not only things like ketamine and mushrooms.

467
00:50:54,850 --> 00:50:58,020
Like covering lot or.

468
00:51:02,560 --> 00:51:07,200
Yeah. Diagnosis. Absolutely right.

469
00:51:07,350 --> 00:51:11,370
And so there have been. That's going to have a snowball into that thing.

470
00:51:11,760 --> 00:51:17,790
Yeah. I mean, I think that's also just thinking about like medical marijuana being first, right?

471
00:51:17,790 --> 00:51:23,450
Like that was the space for sort of emerging and getting a medical marijuana card.

472
00:51:23,460 --> 00:51:27,990
It's like a fake I.D., right? It's like the same idea. Now, one doesn't need to do that.

473
00:51:27,990 --> 00:51:33,629
You just get a fake I.D. there and then like different changes over time in this space.

474
00:51:33,630 --> 00:51:38,340
And it's there's a lot to kind of think about and puzzle over, but.

475
00:51:39,210 --> 00:51:50,210
Oh, I'll say one more thing about with kids is that. This vaping not safer again, like research is still coming out about this.

476
00:51:50,660 --> 00:51:58,970
But I would argue like getting an entire like sort of new generation on vaping is not ideal.

477
00:51:59,210 --> 00:52:02,150
But I would also say, and if you talked to Ken Warner,

478
00:52:02,300 --> 00:52:09,560
our former dean doesn't have a tobacco researcher, like if you're a 50 year smoker, vaping is safer.

479
00:52:10,280 --> 00:52:17,990
My argument is that if your kid getting into vaping is not safe, then just not smoking, which is like what kids weren't doing anymore.

480
00:52:18,380 --> 00:52:27,320
So I'm like, But yeah, go ahead. Like, for me, just I feel like it's so complicated because on one side we're saying, yeah, in some cases,

481
00:52:27,320 --> 00:52:34,820
drugs are very harmful by like prompting like you want to for some people like treatments for cancer and like destigmatizing it in that arena.

482
00:52:34,830 --> 00:52:37,879
But I think it's like it's often like one or the other.

483
00:52:37,880 --> 00:52:44,360
It's not like in these spaces we want to destigmatize the use of it because of certain aspects of the way it's being used.

484
00:52:44,780 --> 00:52:52,430
But in other contexts it is very harmful. And I think like as a public health person, I think it's like very tricky to figure out like what?

485
00:52:52,520 --> 00:52:57,090
Like where you're trading in the communication space about like around these topics.

486
00:52:57,450 --> 00:53:02,360
Yes. Yes. It's really tricky and it's like really different segments and really different messaging.

487
00:53:02,890 --> 00:53:11,000
And then when you think like big picture, like we are drug taking culture, you know, like full stop, like about everything.

488
00:53:11,300 --> 00:53:14,480
And so is this just one more? Why is this special?

489
00:53:14,810 --> 00:53:22,310
Is it special? I don't know. Yeah, I'm giving a presentation on vaping and in another class, I talked to Time Warner,

490
00:53:22,370 --> 00:53:27,800
and he's obviously very like he has like a lot of ideas, but he's very in the space.

491
00:53:27,820 --> 00:53:34,940
Like we have different ideas and stuff. But I thought one thing that he brought up that was going for why have we been focusing

492
00:53:35,240 --> 00:53:39,590
like pretty much almost on news stories have been like when they talk about vaping,

493
00:53:39,590 --> 00:53:42,999
it's like all about the children and like how, you know, the actual jumping up.

494
00:53:43,000 --> 00:53:47,149
We don't focus on adult smokers that can really use this as an alternative method.

495
00:53:47,150 --> 00:53:53,990
And it's kind of like a social justice aspect because, you know, people that are smoking cigarets are often,

496
00:53:53,990 --> 00:53:59,000
you know, you know, from diverse communities, lower income, LGBTQ and stuff like that.

497
00:53:59,000 --> 00:54:04,909
And we don't they don't have as much of our versus vaping it like hits all demographics especially

498
00:54:04,910 --> 00:54:10,729
you know more higher income children because they can afford to get stuff and might have

499
00:54:10,730 --> 00:54:16,010
something on parents that have that higher income can go to like their local congressman and be

500
00:54:16,010 --> 00:54:20,600
like ban this you know let's not have this because my kid is doing this or something like that.

501
00:54:20,600 --> 00:54:23,690
So it's very it's a very nuanced topic for sure.

502
00:54:24,200 --> 00:54:28,249
Yeah, it's good. It's multifaceted and it's yeah, it's fascinating.

503
00:54:28,250 --> 00:54:32,809
And it is changing. So. Um, so yeah.

504
00:54:32,810 --> 00:54:34,280
Lots more to think about.

505
00:54:34,280 --> 00:54:43,700
And I think this is like also one of the public health lines of, like, this is just like, you know, you can, you can find them everywhere.

506
00:54:43,700 --> 00:54:47,479
But I think it's just so fascinating.

507
00:54:47,480 --> 00:54:57,300
And to drive around the state like Michigan, where it's legal and you see billboards of all types, and I was driving like sort of car, oh, no, no, no.

508
00:54:57,770 --> 00:55:02,540
Oh, is it? And they're just so frequent and it's just so fascinating.

509
00:55:03,230 --> 00:55:08,690
And then you go to a state where there where it's not legal and you just don't see it.

510
00:55:08,900 --> 00:55:12,500
And it's again, been such a rapid, rapid shift.

511
00:55:12,680 --> 00:55:17,030
Yeah. And I was just going to say, I used to live in Wisconsin. And you do still see this?

512
00:55:17,030 --> 00:55:23,600
Like if you drive north in Wisconsin, they will have billboards counting down the miles until you get to like open border.

513
00:55:24,020 --> 00:55:28,400
We're like, how much longer until you can buy meat? Right, right.

514
00:55:28,430 --> 00:55:35,120
Yeah. It's like fireworks in Indiana. Yeah, it's it's it is it is amazing to me.

515
00:55:35,120 --> 00:55:39,049
And I think it's just so it's just so fascinating.

516
00:55:39,050 --> 00:55:50,480
And like, I think it was this one that got particularly called out as like a child focused ad because in the in the eighties and nineties,

517
00:55:50,480 --> 00:55:53,570
they had this like Joe Camel figure with smoking.

518
00:55:53,660 --> 00:55:59,209
And he was a cartoon that very directly appealed to kids.

519
00:55:59,210 --> 00:56:04,430
And so they were like, you know, and so when I see these two, I'm like, didn't we hash this out already?

520
00:56:04,880 --> 00:56:06,860
You know, haven't we kind of legislated this?

521
00:56:07,310 --> 00:56:14,150
But it's, you know, I guess in legal terms or whatever it is like different enough that it's not been yet fully worked out,

522
00:56:14,150 --> 00:56:19,910
but the lawsuits are all pending and figuring that out and also, um, you know,

523
00:56:20,510 --> 00:56:29,540
I think that those sort of socioeconomic elements around vaping and cannabis and who gets to sell and make money from vaping and

524
00:56:29,540 --> 00:56:41,840
cannabis are also really significant because a lot of these like by city level approvals for businesses that were supposed to go to.

525
00:56:42,350 --> 00:56:49,130
Like African-American people who had gotten incarcerated for selling cannabis ten, 15 years ago.

526
00:56:49,640 --> 00:56:59,510
But that's not always worked out. And so I think that that whole bigger picture of social determinants of being able to make money from this is.

527
00:57:01,060 --> 00:57:05,320
It's going to be, again, important to watch.

528
00:57:08,230 --> 00:57:17,410
What else? So he's going to say these are all just I think these were all just either local or in my travels.

529
00:57:17,710 --> 00:57:26,470
So, you know, I like I didn't like I think I took these this one I don't know if people remember Borat, but there's like a Borat one.

530
00:57:26,470 --> 00:57:29,970
And I mean, it's just amazing. Like the ring. It's pretty impressive.

531
00:57:29,980 --> 00:57:35,870
Like from a marketing perspective, I'm like, wow, that's, you know, quite something.

532
00:57:35,890 --> 00:57:42,680
So yeah, in some states you can get marijuana companies like DoorDash.

533
00:57:43,390 --> 00:57:46,390
I think you can in Ann Arbor. Yeah. Yeah, you should.

534
00:57:48,010 --> 00:57:52,270
You know, I would say, like, maybe that's better. You just sit in your apartment, right?

535
00:57:53,000 --> 00:58:01,300
Yeah. Like, that's actually okay. Yeah, my sister, my sister, my daughter worked at this bakery that was across from Blum.

536
00:58:01,660 --> 00:58:10,410
If people had been there, like on Miller, Ashland, and a lot of people I know have been like, Oh, isn't that a flower shop?

537
00:58:10,420 --> 00:58:11,530
I went to get flowers,

538
00:58:11,530 --> 00:58:19,120
and every now and then she just witnessed so many people kind of like stumbling across the street from bloom and coming in the bakery.

539
00:58:19,120 --> 00:58:23,380
And I was like, you know, it's really good for your business. Like, just keep tabs, you know?

540
00:58:23,500 --> 00:58:31,930
So it's very, very interesting. And it's, it's kind of creating a lot of interesting contexts to, to think about.

541
00:58:33,670 --> 00:58:35,170
Let's see what else? Oh, yeah.

542
00:58:35,170 --> 00:58:49,480
And just to sort of show this, so this is marijuana use up to 2013, you know, and it's kind of floating along, you know, it's there.

543
00:58:51,820 --> 00:58:59,830
But then here more recent data show that so cigaret use this goes from 1991 to 2019.

544
00:58:59,830 --> 00:59:07,840
So COVID isn't really even on here yet. Right. And that they might have to like extend the, you know, the the side of the graph here.

545
00:59:07,840 --> 00:59:17,010
But you can see the cigarets are in green and they sort of start off here in 1991, around 30%.

546
00:59:17,020 --> 00:59:24,970
Full disclosure, that's like my college era. And then they kind of continue up a little bit and really start to drop off here.

547
00:59:26,580 --> 00:59:29,500
And I think these are these are monitoring the future.

548
00:59:29,500 --> 00:59:37,540
So for those of you guys who know that service resides assignments, people often say like it's a mile wide and an inch deep.

549
00:59:37,540 --> 00:59:44,349
So they ask nationally representative sample of like all high school I think seniors and maybe also

550
00:59:44,350 --> 00:59:50,290
10th graders and this is seniors and they just ask about a bunch of different behavior things.

551
00:59:51,040 --> 00:59:55,719
So a lot of these surveys like this that you'll see come from monitoring the future anyway.

552
00:59:55,720 --> 00:59:59,950
And so then you can see marijuana is sort of low and then it like crosses over

553
00:59:59,950 --> 01:00:06,849
overtake cigarets around 2010 and that's just plain cigarets and marijuana.

554
01:00:06,850 --> 01:00:16,600
And then if you look here, vape nicotine and vape marijuana really start to increase and it's really 2017 just like availability starts,

555
01:00:16,600 --> 01:00:22,509
the ease of delivery is greater, the range of delivery systems is greater, the range of flavors is greater.

556
01:00:22,510 --> 01:00:27,580
So everything just sort of like starts to increase and they didn't even ask about it before that.

557
01:00:28,420 --> 01:00:31,690
So that just sort of adds to highlight. That's five years ago. All right.

558
01:00:31,690 --> 01:00:36,459
So that's just not not that long ago. Okay.

559
01:00:36,460 --> 01:00:47,770
So just so you guys have the info and then just to sort of highlight a few impacts and this, you know, why we would focus on use of vaping.

560
01:00:50,530 --> 01:00:58,570
Some studies of this have been increasingly replicated associations with psychosis and psychotic symptoms.

561
01:00:59,020 --> 01:01:08,229
So, you know, this is sort of a hard thing to study because it's not that common, but it's this finding has been replicated,

562
01:01:08,230 --> 01:01:15,670
especially for kids who smoke more and are more dependent on cannabis, is that there's increased rates of psychosis.

563
01:01:16,180 --> 01:01:20,950
And then this idea of like, what's the mechanism, right?

564
01:01:20,950 --> 01:01:30,460
What's the need, why the behavior change is happening while they're definitely seeing differences in brain volume and then sort of testing more,

565
01:01:31,090 --> 01:01:40,870
I would say nuanced outcomes than psychosis and finding evidence for association between even milder use again in younger,

566
01:01:41,770 --> 01:01:50,960
younger adolescent kids and behaviors that, you know, are less dramatic, let's say psychosis.

567
01:01:51,700 --> 01:02:00,220
Um, so that my, my take would be like, if you're going to do it, wait till you're after, you know.

568
01:02:00,340 --> 01:02:04,730
Age 14 after age 16. So sort of post-high school.

569
01:02:04,750 --> 01:02:13,840
Not quite as worried about college students, although I do think that motivational factors really, really suffer with excessive cannabis use.

570
01:02:16,540 --> 01:02:25,420
Okay. I think the last thing just to talk about is that this is back to the idea of

571
01:02:26,800 --> 01:02:30,310
how can would be better than dare and having to be better than just say no.

572
01:02:30,370 --> 01:02:34,510
And how can we kind of reflect the realities of people's lives?

573
01:02:34,900 --> 01:02:39,700
Right. And so it's this question of like screening for problematic use.

574
01:02:39,700 --> 01:02:45,790
Right? Like, okay, I occasionally use it helps my anxiety and gosh is like a godsend.

575
01:02:45,790 --> 01:02:49,270
I'm so happy I have this in my life and it makes my life so much better.

576
01:02:49,450 --> 01:02:54,240
At my mild levels of use when I'm anxious. I would say that's not problematic.

577
01:02:54,250 --> 01:03:05,139
Yes, right. And so what we want to do is think about, again, the context of why people and motivations for why people are using things, substances.

578
01:03:05,140 --> 01:03:08,200
And so things like have you used it alone?

579
01:03:08,950 --> 01:03:13,239
So maybe by itself that would be a big indicator to relax again.

580
01:03:13,240 --> 01:03:18,850
By itself wouldn't be a big indicator. But as you get into these things, it's sort of like I use so much that I forget things.

581
01:03:19,450 --> 01:03:29,770
I go driving. That's a big one because again, it's not like we didn't think, you know, being stoned and driving was awesome.

582
01:03:30,100 --> 01:03:33,990
You know, it's not that we thought it was awesome. We just like, there's not that.

583
01:03:34,450 --> 01:03:39,609
It's just a little more difficult then with alcohol. Right. To regulate and to test and all these things.

584
01:03:39,610 --> 01:03:46,749
So that sort of floated below the radar of everyone in the car have gotten into trouble.

585
01:03:46,750 --> 01:03:55,300
Have my family friends told me to cut down so you know like flipping on the from alcohol literature but sort of this idea of not only should we,

586
01:03:56,110 --> 01:04:03,460
you know, think about the context of use, but like when it's problematic, that's when you want to get somebody connected with services.

587
01:04:04,930 --> 01:04:09,820
And so the other thing was kind of back to type not schools today.

588
01:04:11,260 --> 01:04:17,430
The other thing is school based delivery is this idea of, you know, dare was 17 lessons long.

589
01:04:17,440 --> 01:04:23,620
People were making posters and singing and art projects around there and it was like a huge focus of the school curriculum.

590
01:04:24,040 --> 01:04:30,250
But perhaps if we can sort of introduce these things in terms of briefer interventions that might be less academic,

591
01:04:31,330 --> 01:04:33,940
also take up less time, school time for other things.

592
01:04:35,350 --> 01:04:41,860
And I was just letting people in here familiar with motivational interviewing, but just like, what else could you do?

593
01:04:41,890 --> 01:04:44,740
You know, if the reason you're using is stress or anxiety, like,

594
01:04:44,740 --> 01:04:49,510
what else could you do to relieve that just so and then to connect people to treatment so this

595
01:04:49,510 --> 01:04:56,140
isn't good currently of more recommended model than like the dare I say no Nancy Reagan model.

596
01:04:59,170 --> 01:05:10,520
Okay. So I think I'll just pause on these questions, but then we can end a little early because I told some folks,

597
01:05:10,520 --> 01:05:18,010
I talk with them about papers, but I think this these questions are good to think about just for the intervention paper,

598
01:05:18,760 --> 01:05:26,200
because that's kind of how you guys will be evaluating interventions that are applied to your public health or your developmental health issue.

599
01:05:27,220 --> 01:05:32,260
And so as you're kind of thinking through, okay, I found these interventions, they seem to work,

600
01:05:32,260 --> 01:05:36,340
they seem to not work like one of the dimensions along which I want to critique them.

601
01:05:36,460 --> 01:05:43,090
It's kind of these dimensions, but it's not necessarily dissemination because you guys aren't like disseminating,

602
01:05:43,090 --> 01:05:46,090
but you're just kind of writing about this process things.

603
01:05:47,260 --> 01:05:52,210
So yeah, so we can pause and everybody should go vote if they haven't voted.

604
01:05:52,480 --> 01:05:58,120
And I'll hang out and talk to folks who want to check in on papers.

605
01:05:59,230 --> 01:06:02,710
So I'll see you guys on Thursday.

606
01:06:11,510 --> 01:06:31,690
I'm. So I love to aim high the truth, but it also includes just care.

607
01:06:32,710 --> 01:06:35,750
I was wondering what you've done. The two of them.

608
01:06:35,770 --> 01:06:41,880
The two of you. Should I add in the third element or just, oh, you don't need to.

609
01:06:42,940 --> 01:06:45,730
And I could just focus on the other two aspects. Yeah.

610
01:06:45,790 --> 01:06:54,460
Because then you'd have to like I remember that, you know, if they didn't distinguish like, oh yeah, it's, it's, it's in another language.

611
01:06:55,510 --> 01:07:01,329
Really. Yeah. But, and they're going to like expand that to some of the others.

612
01:07:01,330 --> 01:07:07,810
But this was for dyslexia. And so they would say the letter, the word,

613
01:07:08,380 --> 01:07:17,620
and then you would have to pronounce it like say it identifier or they would give you audibly notorious, right?

614
01:07:20,800 --> 01:07:26,990
Yeah, that's really nice. So what?

615
01:07:27,100 --> 01:07:31,600
What is the language and where do I start?

616
01:07:33,610 --> 01:07:40,310
Yeah. Yeah, I don't know.

617
01:07:41,710 --> 01:07:48,460
I wonder how they say it later.

618
01:07:48,680 --> 01:07:52,450
Yeah. Oh, but you think so.

619
01:07:53,860 --> 01:08:00,460
But they were doing it. Yeah. Usually because, like, everything seems to start with an emotion.

620
01:08:00,940 --> 01:08:05,739
But yeah, they purposefully started in mother, which then they're going to English.

621
01:08:05,740 --> 01:08:09,010
But I just wanted to make sure that I was. Oh, yeah.

622
01:08:09,320 --> 01:08:13,820
Yeah. I mean, I'd be curious, like to distinguish between.

623
01:08:14,380 --> 01:08:24,190
Yeah. And like I was applying this to all the lines of learning disorder, sort distinguishing, you know.

624
01:08:24,260 --> 01:08:30,760
Yeah. So that's like speaking. But of course I was, they're only do it like one specifically with like this graph.

625
01:08:30,830 --> 01:08:35,080
It's only like that and like how, like how long you take.

626
01:08:36,040 --> 01:08:39,760
And they're not doing like spelling out like, something that they could.

627
01:08:40,730 --> 01:08:44,050
Oh, yeah, yeah. So I could get more, a little more targeted. Yeah.

628
01:08:45,880 --> 01:08:51,610
And then this is most liquid on like early elementary grade.

629
01:08:54,820 --> 01:09:01,930
I forget in your paper what you if you came to a particular time point, that was the best for interventions.

630
01:09:01,930 --> 01:09:05,340
I think that would be, yeah. That makes.

631
01:09:06,240 --> 01:09:15,900
Yeah. Okay. I just wanted to make sure I'm on the right track, and then I want to ask about whether or not to include this couple in there.

632
01:09:15,940 --> 01:09:19,700
Yeah, that sounds good. Okay. Seems like a good find. Yeah.

633
01:09:22,270 --> 01:09:28,920
Hey. Yeah. No, I had emailed with you guys back, so I said, those are crazy.

634
01:09:29,450 --> 01:09:32,760
Okay, so I'm going to just.

635
01:09:32,880 --> 01:09:37,470
Oh, no, I'm just probably want to email this, all right?

636
01:09:38,040 --> 01:09:38,940
Yeah, exactly.

637
01:09:39,960 --> 01:09:46,750
So I just kind of wanted to go through and just make sure you we're going to understand what they're asking for so I don't make the mistakes again.

638
01:09:47,220 --> 01:09:50,490
I don't want to take. Because this is quoting.

639
01:09:50,840 --> 01:09:53,920
Yeah. Yeah. So I'm well.

640
01:09:54,630 --> 01:10:00,650
So. So I do this offshore and the thing they want is direct, quote unquote, sent out quote.

641
01:10:00,690 --> 01:10:06,179
So it's just been kind of ingrained in me right now with a lot of like clinical work and getting their perspective.

642
01:10:06,180 --> 01:10:09,750
So I don't like I just kind of went through and did that without thinking.

643
01:10:11,070 --> 01:10:15,340
And that's kind of where I don't know where we ended up with all of the quotes here.

644
01:10:15,360 --> 01:10:19,440
So, you know, that's just like from research papers and research.

645
01:10:19,890 --> 01:10:25,800
That's what I'm hearing because they're just like, I think there's been some issues with plagiarizing.

646
01:10:25,950 --> 01:10:30,210
I don't know. They just say we just rather have the full quote and just don't go far.

647
01:10:30,240 --> 01:10:34,430
So, I mean, that is one way to go about it.

648
01:10:34,440 --> 01:10:39,420
So that's good to know. Yeah. So, I mean, it's heartbreaking to find plagiarism.

649
01:10:39,690 --> 01:10:45,740
It's just awesome. Yeah. And I mean, that's so I think that's kind of how I get some context.

650
01:10:45,750 --> 01:10:51,330
I don't know where that came from, just as how I was so used to been writing lately.

651
01:10:51,340 --> 01:10:55,650
Yeah. And I think like what I would say too, it's an idea.

652
01:10:55,660 --> 01:11:05,220
And I remember yeah. So, and I do sometimes see that in student writing and I go, I think you could have probably said this and you know,

653
01:11:05,670 --> 01:11:13,220
yeah, but then that's hard because you know, people copy paste and then you think they change it, right?

654
01:11:13,410 --> 01:11:22,649
Like it's just so much better just to be like, I'm never copying and pasting anything in to a document that is coming from me and

655
01:11:22,650 --> 01:11:28,560
then with direct quotes kind of keeping them for like a strange phrase or like a,

656
01:11:29,520 --> 01:11:34,170
you know, a meaningful, motivating something for the people.

657
01:11:34,200 --> 01:11:39,660
Okay, you know, like it's possible to use them, but if it's like a big chunk and it's sort of saying,

658
01:11:40,530 --> 01:11:51,159
you know, this is what this research study found. I think it's much better to try to link and I think it would be better it would be

659
01:11:51,160 --> 01:11:57,490
better to and easier to do with the second people because it'll be more like for you.

660
01:11:57,730 --> 01:12:00,459
Yeah, right. Yeah. This is how I do this.

661
01:12:00,460 --> 01:12:09,310
And, you know, you still have like they found this, but it's also like a good way to check your comprehension and just digestion.

662
01:12:09,430 --> 01:12:17,740
Yeah, that's what I was going to say before digesting that material because of your direct quoting or like sort of,

663
01:12:17,950 --> 01:12:22,420
you know, half editing material, which I see all the time and animals like.

664
01:12:23,800 --> 01:12:34,210
But it just sort of shows like I get it, I understand it, and I'm going to like put my tape on the same information, okay?

665
01:12:34,480 --> 01:12:44,440
Instead of like even in my right and everything, it just sort of even if it's like it's still fully integrated,

666
01:12:44,950 --> 01:12:50,230
long quote, it still demonstrates knowledge better.

667
01:12:50,580 --> 01:12:55,360
Okay. Mastering. Okay. When you like, digest it.

668
01:12:56,170 --> 01:12:59,500
Put it out again, possibly to like. No, no, that's that's okay.

669
01:12:59,890 --> 01:13:03,100
Yeah. Yeah. And, you know, I just should have, um.

670
01:13:03,280 --> 01:13:08,669
I didn't even think to come and check with you before about. Yeah, that's just what I do, and that's good.

671
01:13:08,670 --> 01:13:09,579
So it's a good point.

672
01:13:09,580 --> 01:13:16,060
And I just want to and not that this is not something that I just want to check because I feel like every year I like revise this a little more.

673
01:13:16,090 --> 01:13:24,850
Oh, maybe somebody to bring something and revise the rubric more because I try to forecast what people are doing.

674
01:13:24,850 --> 01:13:34,480
Okay. And so I would switch because content wise, you kind of you basically said like the content was good content.

675
01:13:34,520 --> 01:13:41,360
I got all of that. Okay. Yes. Oh, in that this was direct quotes are used sparingly if ever you need a page number that did that.

676
01:13:41,590 --> 01:13:46,690
And then I also add I had this few years ago avoid following the organization of existing papers,

677
01:13:47,320 --> 01:13:53,560
which basically also means like if you find it's happens all the time with like childhood obesity prevention,

678
01:13:54,730 --> 01:14:01,150
there's like some review papers out there that just step through, like infants, toddlers, you know, just kind of like my break.

679
01:14:01,630 --> 01:14:09,040
And so I'm like, the more you like, if you find that paper, okay, it's sort of great for your research, you know?

680
01:14:09,430 --> 01:14:16,270
Yeah. But then you get kind of hampered because it's really hard to get away from that because they did it so perfectly.

681
01:14:16,270 --> 01:14:19,389
Right, right. And it's published and. Yeah, exactly right.

682
01:14:19,390 --> 01:14:24,430
Okay. And so I think that here it's really like for you to kind of again,

683
01:14:24,430 --> 01:14:34,989
like digest the issue of put it in your own words and then for the upcoming paper, you know, and remind me what you're going to be doing.

684
01:14:34,990 --> 01:14:46,390
Child abuse. Yeah. So are there interventions that you think about or know about or also from social cues that would be appropriate to.

685
01:14:46,600 --> 01:14:47,440
Oh, yeah,

686
01:14:47,440 --> 01:14:55,099
I was I was kind of thinking doing a lot of like the parent talking about like the parent of kind of we did like early on with like the parent

687
01:14:55,100 --> 01:15:03,550
interventions and the videos and kind of going more that out to kind of target that age population and some ACE score knowledge as well.

688
01:15:04,060 --> 01:15:11,020
Um, I think, you know, this is kind of where I was thinking with that one because I use a lot of, you know,

689
01:15:11,020 --> 01:15:14,679
I didn't find one paper that laid it out, you know, kind of like it's the child that they had to pull from.

690
01:15:14,680 --> 01:15:17,470
Like a lot of yeah, I think I don't even know how many sources I know.

691
01:15:17,530 --> 01:15:22,570
If you did have a lot of sources, I think that's probably why I was trying to just give a lot of feedback.

692
01:15:22,580 --> 01:15:29,200
Yeah. Yeah. And because I, you know, I think you can it's not that I doubt you can do it and that makes total sense now to me too,

693
01:15:29,230 --> 01:15:34,360
because I was like, I think I remember actually from your paper to like, oh, I in terms of writing you guys.

694
01:15:34,570 --> 01:15:38,040
Oh yeah. I'm like, What is this? So just start.

695
01:15:38,250 --> 01:15:43,629
I'm doing my notes in class. It's so dark. Yeah, yeah.

696
01:15:43,630 --> 01:15:49,200
So like, you're like, those are perfect, they're beautiful. And believe me, a lot of people don't do this.

697
01:15:49,210 --> 01:15:54,580
And I'm like, that's just, just. Yeah. So, yeah, that's lovely.

698
01:15:54,580 --> 01:15:58,570
Beautiful. And I think you got you got it. You have those concepts.

699
01:15:58,660 --> 01:16:06,219
Okay, I'm just there. So I think I have to point out for the first the baby's one and then the five for this,

700
01:16:06,220 --> 01:16:10,420
is there anything I could do to kind of bump that upper framework for you?

701
01:16:11,050 --> 01:16:17,360
Um, I mean, just because I think that that puts me close to the bottom and I,

702
01:16:17,360 --> 01:16:22,120
it's just I felt like I, I did really understand it and put a lot of, you know, research.

703
01:16:22,120 --> 01:16:26,850
I just want to be able to articulate that. I, you know, I didn't mean to use that.

704
01:16:26,890 --> 01:16:36,760
Use the quotes. Yeah. So yeah, I mean, I think that like I don't, I don't I don't tend to give, I don't know, like extra credit or anything.

705
01:16:38,560 --> 01:16:44,080
So but I mean, I think if you do a great job on the other paper and you've always given like your.

706
01:16:44,620 --> 01:16:47,980
The. The the little reading response.

707
01:16:48,040 --> 01:16:52,629
Mm hmm. Um, I mean, I think you should be good.

708
01:16:52,630 --> 01:16:55,930
I don't know how that adds up in the grading and grad school.

709
01:16:56,290 --> 01:17:03,580
Like, really? Really? Yeah, I'm looking at some Ph.D., so I'm just a little extra.

710
01:17:04,090 --> 01:17:08,190
Yeah, sure. Yeah, but, I mean, I.

711
01:17:08,290 --> 01:17:16,629
I would. I don't. I don't know how the crime calculating works in terms of being able to call that to mind.

712
01:17:16,630 --> 01:17:23,220
And, um, I can't imagine. I like to think you're in the range of a B.

713
01:17:25,770 --> 01:17:30,569
Well, this puts me at a 93 with the loss of these two.

714
01:17:30,570 --> 01:17:33,960
So. Okay. So then to rock your last paper.

715
01:17:35,490 --> 01:17:39,350
If I do perfect on the 99. Okay. I just. Just wanted to make sure.

716
01:17:39,900 --> 01:17:45,510
Yeah. Yeah. Okay. And I think with the next paper to focus on doing perfect on the next paper and again,

717
01:17:45,510 --> 01:17:47,819
like, it's good, really good to have the conversation about writing.

718
01:17:47,820 --> 01:17:53,640
And I, yeah, I've debated about how much I end up discussing this in here and I try to sort of give resources and.

719
01:17:55,480 --> 01:17:59,350
To discuss that with feedback on people's other papers.

720
01:18:01,150 --> 01:18:06,220
But I don't think I use any quotes in the babies one provided they were limited.

721
01:18:06,460 --> 01:18:10,540
I don't think we need a reference list. Yeah, I can't remember.

722
01:18:10,870 --> 01:18:18,430
But you know, I mean, my focus is really like if I notice things about writing, I'll give that feedback.

723
01:18:18,440 --> 01:18:30,790
So I think we pay attention to that feedback. I think with the intervention paper to see if I have that for you thinking probably because

724
01:18:30,790 --> 01:18:34,680
I think what's yeah because I think that that's the next thing I was looking through.

725
01:18:34,690 --> 01:18:37,850
That's yeah. That's the next thing I have. Yeah. Let's try.

726
01:18:40,420 --> 01:18:40,750
Okay.

727
01:18:40,870 --> 01:18:50,010
So, so why would you do it at this age if you do like early relational health kind of interventions, it's like they're finding this relationship.

728
01:18:50,020 --> 01:18:54,430
It can be a buffer to brain development a little bit, maybe.

729
01:18:54,520 --> 01:18:59,389
Mm hmm. And, like, why that early relationship is so important in these different domains.

730
01:18:59,390 --> 01:19:06,030
So that's like, why you're focusing on that age that seems straight forward, you know?

731
01:19:07,630 --> 01:19:14,370
So if you find an intervention like you can choose kind of an intervention, that's helpful.

732
01:19:14,620 --> 01:19:21,639
And so there could be you know, there are there are a number of things and some we've talked about in here like the find,

733
01:19:21,640 --> 01:19:32,260
some are like, yeah, that VIP, there's like a few different video mediated ones or um, I could.

734
01:19:32,620 --> 01:19:37,689
Would it be okay if I pulled the ones from class? Because those are the ones I was kind of thinking know probably be the best.

735
01:19:37,690 --> 01:19:43,509
Yeah, that might be great. And then what you what the key thing here, let me just double check of my instructions again.

736
01:19:43,510 --> 01:19:46,830
Like sometimes I feel like I write too much because I'm going to try to like, yeah, everything.

737
01:19:46,840 --> 01:19:52,569
No, that's okay. So you want to describe the theoretical rationale for the intervention.

738
01:19:52,570 --> 01:19:57,580
So kind of like I was trying out today like that the mechanism, like why would we think this?

739
01:19:57,580 --> 01:19:58,720
But what about.
