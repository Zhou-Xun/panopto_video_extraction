1
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:11,280
In this module, I'm
going to give you

2
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:12,975
an introduction to water.

3
00:00:12,975 --> 00:00:14,640
But I want you to think first of

4
00:00:14,640 --> 00:00:16,770
two things that you
can't live without.

5
00:00:16,770 --> 00:00:18,420
You might come up
with answers like

6
00:00:18,420 --> 00:00:20,985
your family or your dog
or your smartphone.

7
00:00:20,985 --> 00:00:22,350
I actually mean two things you

8
00:00:22,350 --> 00:00:24,030
absolutely can't live without,

9
00:00:24,030 --> 00:00:26,625
and what I'm thinking
of are air and water.

10
00:00:26,625 --> 00:00:28,780
We've talked about air
in another module,

11
00:00:28,780 --> 00:00:30,390
and you probably know
that you can only

12
00:00:30,390 --> 00:00:32,940
survive a few minutes
at most without air.

13
00:00:32,940 --> 00:00:34,590
Did you know though that
you can actually only

14
00:00:34,590 --> 00:00:36,975
survive about three
days without water?

15
00:00:36,975 --> 00:00:38,600
So water is absolutely

16
00:00:38,600 --> 00:00:40,630
critical to human life,
and in this module,

17
00:00:40,630 --> 00:00:43,340
we'll be exploring how
this fluid has been so

18
00:00:43,340 --> 00:00:47,290
influential in shaping
the existence of humans.

19
00:00:47,290 --> 00:00:50,390
First though, I'd like to
give you just an overview

20
00:00:50,390 --> 00:00:52,955
of the amount of water
we have on Earth.

21
00:00:52,955 --> 00:00:55,940
So in this graphic, you
can see the large box of

22
00:00:55,940 --> 00:00:58,250
blue circles represents
all the water

23
00:00:58,250 --> 00:00:59,550
available on the planet.

24
00:00:59,550 --> 00:01:01,670
You'll see that 97.5

25
00:01:01,670 --> 00:01:04,960
percent of those little
circles are light blue.

26
00:01:04,960 --> 00:01:06,885
That corresponds to salt water.

27
00:01:06,885 --> 00:01:09,680
So immediately, almost 98
percent of all the water

28
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:12,680
on Earth is not directly
drinkable by humans.

29
00:01:12,680 --> 00:01:14,300
We have that last little bit,

30
00:01:14,300 --> 00:01:15,380
two and a half percent,

31
00:01:15,380 --> 00:01:18,935
that represents our entire
global stock of freshwater.

32
00:01:18,935 --> 00:01:20,450
That's divided between about

33
00:01:20,450 --> 00:01:23,170
0.3 percent in lakes and rivers,

34
00:01:23,170 --> 00:01:25,230
about 31 percent of

35
00:01:25,230 --> 00:01:26,460
that two and a half percent

36
00:01:26,460 --> 00:01:28,410
is underground in groundwater.

37
00:01:28,410 --> 00:01:31,429
Then about 69 percent
of all the freshwater

38
00:01:31,429 --> 00:01:34,310
is locked up in glaciers
and permanent snow cover.

39
00:01:34,310 --> 00:01:36,440
So again, of that two
and a half percent of

40
00:01:36,440 --> 00:01:38,660
all the water on Earth
that's freshwater,

41
00:01:38,660 --> 00:01:40,790
a vanishingly small fraction of

42
00:01:40,790 --> 00:01:44,080
that is directly
available for us to use.

43
00:01:44,080 --> 00:01:46,400
Let me explore that
a little bit more.

44
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:48,500
This image is showing
you the distribution of

45
00:01:48,500 --> 00:01:50,765
glaciers and permanent ice caps.

46
00:01:50,765 --> 00:01:53,645
So this is water in a form
that we can't directly use.

47
00:01:53,645 --> 00:01:56,735
Although for some populations
around the planet,

48
00:01:56,735 --> 00:01:59,960
people are dependent on
meltwater from glaciers and

49
00:01:59,960 --> 00:02:01,160
permanent ice caps that

50
00:02:01,160 --> 00:02:03,260
provides drinking water
for them year round.

51
00:02:03,260 --> 00:02:04,340
This happens, for example,

52
00:02:04,340 --> 00:02:06,290
at the foot of the Himalayas.

53
00:02:06,290 --> 00:02:07,820
So you can see of
all the glaciers

54
00:02:07,820 --> 00:02:08,840
and permanent ice caps,

55
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:11,360
the vast majority are
in the Antarctica,

56
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:13,130
followed by Greenland, and then

57
00:02:13,130 --> 00:02:15,830
dispersed across
all the continents.

58
00:02:15,830 --> 00:02:18,710
We could also look at
groundwater and the way

59
00:02:18,710 --> 00:02:20,880
it's distributed across
the different continents.

60
00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:23,135
Here, we can see
that Asia and Africa

61
00:02:23,135 --> 00:02:25,865
have the largest
stocks of groundwater,

62
00:02:25,865 --> 00:02:27,455
followed by North America,

63
00:02:27,455 --> 00:02:28,280
and then of course we have

64
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:29,915
Australia bringing up the rear.

65
00:02:29,915 --> 00:02:32,030
So again, water is not
equally distributed

66
00:02:32,030 --> 00:02:34,775
around the globe in
any of its forms.

67
00:02:34,775 --> 00:02:37,220
We can also think about wetlands

68
00:02:37,220 --> 00:02:39,200
and large lakes,
reservoirs, and rivers.

69
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:41,030
So again, this is the
freshwater that's

70
00:02:41,030 --> 00:02:43,040
directly accessible
for human use.

71
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:45,710
Here, we have Africa
and Asia leading

72
00:02:45,710 --> 00:02:48,695
the pack with North
America, again, is third.

73
00:02:48,695 --> 00:02:50,510
I would like to take
a moment though

74
00:02:50,510 --> 00:02:52,250
to highlight the fact
that I'm standing here

75
00:02:52,250 --> 00:02:54,680
in Ann Arbor at the
University of Michigan campus

76
00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:56,150
in the State of Michigan.

77
00:02:56,150 --> 00:02:57,350
The State of Michigan
of course is

78
00:02:57,350 --> 00:02:59,030
surrounded by the Great
Lakes which contain

79
00:02:59,030 --> 00:03:01,100
a full 20 percent of

80
00:03:01,100 --> 00:03:04,360
all the freshwater directly
available on earth,

81
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:07,495
so we're quite fortunate to
be located where we are.

82
00:03:07,495 --> 00:03:10,820
So of course, we use
tremendous amounts of

83
00:03:10,820 --> 00:03:13,565
water for different kinds
of human activities.

84
00:03:13,565 --> 00:03:15,530
It turns out across the globe,

85
00:03:15,530 --> 00:03:17,899
the amount of water
we withdraw increases

86
00:03:17,899 --> 00:03:21,115
between 10 and 12
percent every decade.

87
00:03:21,115 --> 00:03:23,990
The graphic you're looking
at on the right shows

88
00:03:23,990 --> 00:03:27,080
usage by different types
of human activities,

89
00:03:27,080 --> 00:03:29,810
agriculture in green,
domestic in dark red,

90
00:03:29,810 --> 00:03:31,640
and industry in light red.

91
00:03:31,640 --> 00:03:33,320
You can see for all
of these things,

92
00:03:33,320 --> 00:03:37,295
the trend is absolutely
for increasing extraction.

93
00:03:37,295 --> 00:03:40,595
So extraction is us using the
water in the first place.

94
00:03:40,595 --> 00:03:42,740
You can see the bars for
consumption which is

95
00:03:42,740 --> 00:03:44,930
basically how much
of the water can

96
00:03:44,930 --> 00:03:46,970
no longer be used
for other purposes

97
00:03:46,970 --> 00:03:49,510
are also increasing over time.

98
00:03:49,510 --> 00:03:52,760
If we look around the
globe, agriculture is far,

99
00:03:52,760 --> 00:03:55,720
in a way, the number one use
of freshwater by humans.

100
00:03:55,720 --> 00:03:58,324
In fact, that accounts
for about 86 percent

101
00:03:58,324 --> 00:04:00,290
of all freshwater consumption.

102
00:04:00,290 --> 00:04:04,280
Also by 2025, the use of
water for agriculture

103
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:08,525
is expected to grow 1.2
times compared to 2003.

104
00:04:08,525 --> 00:04:10,010
So we have a very thirsty world.

105
00:04:10,010 --> 00:04:12,830
Most of that water globally
ends up going towards

106
00:04:12,830 --> 00:04:14,600
the agriculture and that use is

107
00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:17,300
absolutely increasing over time.

108
00:04:17,300 --> 00:04:20,060
We can look at the global level
or the continental level,

109
00:04:20,060 --> 00:04:21,785
we could also look at
the country level.

110
00:04:21,785 --> 00:04:25,220
So here, we have three images
showing agricultural use,

111
00:04:25,220 --> 00:04:28,205
industrial use, and
domestic usage by country.

112
00:04:28,205 --> 00:04:30,100
I'd like to highlight
a few things here.

113
00:04:30,100 --> 00:04:31,950
First, the United States is

114
00:04:31,950 --> 00:04:33,980
unique in the world
basically because we are

115
00:04:33,980 --> 00:04:36,860
almost equally split
between industrial uses

116
00:04:36,860 --> 00:04:40,885
and agricultural uses as
our primary users of water.

117
00:04:40,885 --> 00:04:44,165
On the other hand, if we look
at Africa and South Asia,

118
00:04:44,165 --> 00:04:45,800
agriculture is absolutely the

119
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:47,740
dominant use of water there.

120
00:04:47,740 --> 00:04:50,960
If we look at Canada and
parts of Russia and Europe,

121
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:54,230
we see that industrial
uses are the primary use.

122
00:04:54,230 --> 00:04:56,390
So again, the primary use of

123
00:04:56,390 --> 00:04:59,660
freshwater differs by country
but in the United States,

124
00:04:59,660 --> 00:05:02,045
it's split between
agriculture and industry.

125
00:05:02,045 --> 00:05:03,500
Again for other countries,

126
00:05:03,500 --> 00:05:06,410
agriculture or industry
can be dominant.

127
00:05:06,410 --> 00:05:09,230
So I'd like to zoom in a
little bit on something

128
00:05:09,230 --> 00:05:11,370
that's maybe more
personally familiar,

129
00:05:11,370 --> 00:05:12,410
which is how we use water

130
00:05:12,410 --> 00:05:14,955
domestically here in
the United States.

131
00:05:14,955 --> 00:05:17,530
It turns out that the
typical American uses

132
00:05:17,530 --> 00:05:20,670
about 82 gallons of water
per person per day,

133
00:05:20,670 --> 00:05:23,080
that's about 42
million gallons of

134
00:05:23,080 --> 00:05:25,630
water getting used every
day in the United States.

135
00:05:25,630 --> 00:05:26,860
About 92 percent of

136
00:05:26,860 --> 00:05:29,350
that freshwater comes
from public supplies,

137
00:05:29,350 --> 00:05:30,610
and the other eight percent

138
00:05:30,610 --> 00:05:32,620
primarily comes from well water.

139
00:05:32,620 --> 00:05:34,870
We can also look
at how that water

140
00:05:34,870 --> 00:05:37,105
is used by the type of activity.

141
00:05:37,105 --> 00:05:39,670
So the graphic you see here
shows different types of

142
00:05:39,670 --> 00:05:41,020
uses that an American

143
00:05:41,020 --> 00:05:42,835
might have for water
during the day.

144
00:05:42,835 --> 00:05:44,380
Flushing the toilet is taking

145
00:05:44,380 --> 00:05:46,520
about 27 percent
of our daily use.

146
00:05:46,520 --> 00:05:48,460
Washing our clothes
averaged out by

147
00:05:48,460 --> 00:05:50,730
the day is about 22 percent.

148
00:05:50,730 --> 00:05:53,175
The shower you take,
about 17 percent.

149
00:05:53,175 --> 00:05:54,430
Just running the faucet for

150
00:05:54,430 --> 00:05:57,190
drinking water or cooking,
about 16 percent.

151
00:05:57,190 --> 00:05:59,170
You can also see leaks here,

152
00:05:59,170 --> 00:06:00,850
which represent a direct waste

153
00:06:00,850 --> 00:06:02,920
of otherwise perfectly
usable water,

154
00:06:02,920 --> 00:06:04,720
account for about 14 percent of

155
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:07,645
our daily use per
person in America.

156
00:06:07,645 --> 00:06:09,280
It turns out that people

157
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:10,840
living in developed countries use

158
00:06:10,840 --> 00:06:12,490
about 10 times more water

159
00:06:12,490 --> 00:06:14,230
daily than developing countries.

160
00:06:14,230 --> 00:06:15,880
So think about us in America

161
00:06:15,880 --> 00:06:17,815
with our 82 gallons
per day of use,

162
00:06:17,815 --> 00:06:19,120
in some developing countries,

163
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:22,645
they use just five gallons
per person per day.

164
00:06:22,645 --> 00:06:24,640
Finally, I want to
introduce you to

165
00:06:24,640 --> 00:06:25,930
two important concepts:

166
00:06:25,930 --> 00:06:28,645
freshwater stress and
freshwater scarcity.

167
00:06:28,645 --> 00:06:30,370
So freshwater stress is

168
00:06:30,370 --> 00:06:32,140
a specific concept that applies

169
00:06:32,140 --> 00:06:34,060
when annual water supplies are

170
00:06:34,060 --> 00:06:36,730
less than 1,700 cubic meters

171
00:06:36,730 --> 00:06:39,720
of water per person
in a given area.

172
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:42,870
Currently, there's about
460 million people or

173
00:06:42,870 --> 00:06:43,910
about eight percent of

174
00:06:43,910 --> 00:06:45,500
the world's population that

175
00:06:45,500 --> 00:06:47,870
lives in an area that
has water stress.

176
00:06:47,870 --> 00:06:49,805
Over the next decade or so,

177
00:06:49,805 --> 00:06:51,140
it's expected to rise to

178
00:06:51,140 --> 00:06:54,590
about a quarter or 25 percent
of the world's population.

179
00:06:54,590 --> 00:06:57,050
Even today, there are 31
countries around the world

180
00:06:57,050 --> 00:07:00,080
facing chronic shortages
of fresh water.

181
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:04,370
So water stress is the
first level of concern.

182
00:07:04,370 --> 00:07:07,850
Water scarcity occurs when
annual water supplies are less

183
00:07:07,850 --> 00:07:11,650
than 1,000 cubic meters
of water per person.

184
00:07:11,650 --> 00:07:14,630
This results when water
is withdrawn from lakes,

185
00:07:14,630 --> 00:07:16,670
reservoirs, rivers
or groundwater,

186
00:07:16,670 --> 00:07:18,380
and it's withdrawn so fast that

187
00:07:18,380 --> 00:07:20,420
the water supply can't
regenerate and is

188
00:07:20,420 --> 00:07:21,920
no longer sufficient to

189
00:07:21,920 --> 00:07:24,710
satisfy the needs of
humans or the ecosystem.

190
00:07:24,710 --> 00:07:26,735
It also results unfortunately in

191
00:07:26,735 --> 00:07:29,420
increased competition
between water users.

192
00:07:29,420 --> 00:07:31,490
So some people have
forecasts that in

193
00:07:31,490 --> 00:07:33,890
the future when
humanity fights wars,

194
00:07:33,890 --> 00:07:36,570
they won't be over energy
or precious metals,

195
00:07:36,570 --> 00:07:38,090
they will be over things like

196
00:07:38,090 --> 00:07:41,345
the access to safe and
fresh drinking water.

197
00:07:41,345 --> 00:07:43,580
We can look at freshwater stress

198
00:07:43,580 --> 00:07:45,110
and scarcity at a global level,

199
00:07:45,110 --> 00:07:47,480
but we can also zoom in and
look at the country level.

200
00:07:47,480 --> 00:07:49,300
So here, we're looking
at two images,

201
00:07:49,300 --> 00:07:51,470
on the left, 1995,
and on the right,

202
00:07:51,470 --> 00:07:53,990
projected to 2025 of

203
00:07:53,990 --> 00:07:55,685
water withdrawal as a percentage

204
00:07:55,685 --> 00:07:57,770
of the total available supply.

205
00:07:57,770 --> 00:07:59,420
The dark blue color indicates

206
00:07:59,420 --> 00:08:00,470
the countries that are using

207
00:08:00,470 --> 00:08:01,790
less than 10 percent of

208
00:08:01,790 --> 00:08:04,295
their total available
supply, no concerns there.

209
00:08:04,295 --> 00:08:05,780
Whereas the yellow and orange

210
00:08:05,780 --> 00:08:07,760
indicate countries that
are using much more,

211
00:08:07,760 --> 00:08:09,200
up to 40 percent or even

212
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:11,360
greater of the
available freshwater.

213
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:12,860
In 1995, you can

214
00:08:12,860 --> 00:08:14,660
see that it's primarily
the Middle East and

215
00:08:14,660 --> 00:08:17,090
North Africa with a
few other countries in

216
00:08:17,090 --> 00:08:19,790
South Asia that are taking out,

217
00:08:19,790 --> 00:08:22,910
for example, between 20
and more than 40 percent

218
00:08:22,910 --> 00:08:25,460
of their total available
water every year.

219
00:08:25,460 --> 00:08:27,560
But if we projected 2025,

220
00:08:27,560 --> 00:08:31,040
you can see there's more
countries in Africa and Asia,

221
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:33,995
including China now,
parts of Western Europe,

222
00:08:33,995 --> 00:08:35,465
and the United States.

223
00:08:35,465 --> 00:08:37,670
So although we are
very fortunate in

224
00:08:37,670 --> 00:08:40,435
the US to have a lot of
drinking water at the surface,

225
00:08:40,435 --> 00:08:42,320
like the Great Lakes,
that doesn't make us

226
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:45,305
immune from freshwater
stress and scarcity.

227
00:08:45,305 --> 00:08:48,230
If we zoom in
specifically on Africa,

228
00:08:48,230 --> 00:08:49,280
so this is projected

229
00:08:49,280 --> 00:08:52,925
freshwater stress and
scarcity in 2025,

230
00:08:52,925 --> 00:08:54,980
so you can see in
just a few years,

231
00:08:54,980 --> 00:08:56,690
we're anticipating
that water will be

232
00:08:56,690 --> 00:09:00,965
scarce for the countries in
the darker orange color,

233
00:09:00,965 --> 00:09:04,550
primarily again in North
Africa and in East Africa.

234
00:09:04,550 --> 00:09:05,900
But there will be
countries that have

235
00:09:05,900 --> 00:09:07,895
entered water stress as well,

236
00:09:07,895 --> 00:09:11,000
in East Africa and
sub-Saharan Africa.

237
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:14,150
So the availability of
freshwater again has been

238
00:09:14,150 --> 00:09:17,120
critical to the evolution of
humans and other species,

239
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:18,710
but it's not an endless resource.

240
00:09:18,710 --> 00:09:20,990
We have to conserve,
and take care,

241
00:09:20,990 --> 00:09:23,180
and not use excessive
amounts of water to

242
00:09:23,180 --> 00:09:24,710
ensure that future generations

243
00:09:24,710 --> 00:09:26,912
will have enough available.
