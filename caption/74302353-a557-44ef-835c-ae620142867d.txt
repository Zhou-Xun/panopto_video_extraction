Hi, this is Atisa Sioshansi, and these are my concluding thoughts on EHS 596.

2
00:00:08,130 --> 00:00:14,700
Yes, when I took the Six American quiz, I ended up being in the alarmed segment.

3
00:00:14,700 --> 00:00:19,230
So yes, I'm aware and worried and concerned about climate change.

4
00:00:19,230 --> 00:00:28,050
And one of the things that stood out to me with the description of that segment is that we don't know what else we can do with the community.

5
00:00:28,050 --> 00:00:35,460
So what this class has helped me understand more are, yes, some of the science behind climate change.

6
00:00:35,460 --> 00:00:40,410
And then specifically, I think some of the the environmental justice,

7
00:00:40,410 --> 00:00:51,270
some of the work that we did around focusing on marginalized and vulnerable communities and the various communication methods that we used.

8
00:00:51,270 --> 00:00:59,490
So I was able to really take what was some of my, you know, questions around how can I impact community?

9
00:00:59,490 --> 00:01:07,260
And now I feel like they can take small steps by understanding the various perspectives that we went through in the class and

10
00:01:07,260 --> 00:01:15,630
specifically the communities that I had learned about more around the homeless community in L.A. and how vulnerable they are,

11
00:01:15,630 --> 00:01:18,510
especially to the climate changes that we're facing.

12
00:01:18,510 --> 00:01:27,360
And then also, though in the rural rural farming and agricultural communities that we also have happen in California.

13
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:36,510
So it's opened up my eyes to just some of the basic actions I can take as a global citizen and impact my local community

14
00:01:36,510 --> 00:01:44,850
and also many of the the communication methods that I can use to really help outreach and share some of the concepts.

15
00:01:44,850 --> 00:01:49,140
Yes, climate change is a very complex problem.

16
00:01:49,140 --> 00:01:55,230
You know, the public health impacts of it also are complex and there are many public health impacts.

17
00:01:55,230 --> 00:02:00,690
So that's another thing that this class really brought out and tied together for me.

18
00:02:00,690 --> 00:02:08,240
So as a public health student and graduate and and you know.

19
00:02:08,240 --> 00:02:17,060
Advocate in the real world, I am able to better understand not only the climate change impacts from an environmental standpoint,

20
00:02:17,060 --> 00:02:25,520
but also the health impacts and then even more the more the amplified health impacts on marginalized communities.

21
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:27,110
So all of that put together,

22
00:02:27,110 --> 00:02:36,680
I feel like I'm leaving this class with a better understanding of the communications toolkits and more around the just humbleness of

23
00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:44,480
understanding that these problems are complex and really being able to leave with a simple message to share with my local community.

24
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:48,832
I think that's the best thing. Thank you.
