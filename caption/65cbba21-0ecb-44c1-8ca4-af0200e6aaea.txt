00:00:04,590 --> 00:00:08,890
What about? I.

2
00:32:25,540 --> 00:32:31,850
Tell me we are cool today. We hang in school today.

3
00:34:32,790 --> 00:34:37,380
Dove men plus care smoother, healthier skin with every shower.

4
00:34:39,270 --> 00:34:43,860
Once I get into the competition, I go to a different place and is not allowed place at all.

5
00:34:45,390 --> 00:34:56,310
Hello New World. The boys and girls have some true stories to tell you back outside, but they still love one.

6
00:34:58,780 --> 00:35:04,870
Yeah. Take off the photo, take off the cloud clouds, kick off the wiper, take off the uniform and take off the car alone.

7
00:35:04,870 --> 00:35:09,580
Take off the flex in the weight loss Take off the weird SUV imitating stuff didn't take enough top off,

8
00:35:09,880 --> 00:35:13,050
take off and fabricate dreams in a microwave means there's a real world outside.

9
00:35:13,420 --> 00:35:19,830
Take off your idols. But after Cairo, he took office and five days later, before the new al-Abadi,

10
00:35:20,070 --> 00:35:24,899
he took off the flag, took off reception, took off the powerful to take off to take off.

11
00:35:24,900 --> 00:35:28,320
Don Shula took off to take off the bank to take off.

12
00:35:28,320 --> 00:35:33,540
But they won't take off. The humble guy can take off. Picasso took off the new logic in the family genre.

13
00:35:33,560 --> 00:35:38,350
Get it off, take off the shirt. Don't take off the dog. Take off the broken bad design.

14
00:35:38,500 --> 00:35:45,570
Wash it off. And what do you have? You are the as [INAUDIBLE] you are to atoms.

15
00:35:45,590 --> 00:35:48,830
And you never know what you have for you. They.

16
00:35:50,120 --> 00:35:52,840
Some who usually come here. Come.

17
00:35:53,920 --> 00:36:00,159
In part, the wording of the women who started the men on the run to the profits of many did not take advantage of a market crash in the industry.

18
00:36:00,160 --> 00:36:05,130
100 of them didn't even know about where they making them are going to be by the women when they watch it.

19
00:36:05,140 --> 00:36:08,650
Follow this. They must never be younger than Buck, never know what they did.

20
00:36:08,650 --> 00:36:12,550
I got to relax. When I tell all my decisions is they tell me why she was there.

21
00:36:12,640 --> 00:36:18,040
I am to real company. I'm no one decision. Do take any person no telling with the black in the way, no wrong in the right.

22
00:36:18,040 --> 00:36:21,890
You hope people are changing goes under the better. They came with Mary your speech.

23
00:36:24,060 --> 00:36:29,610
But you are two teams. You still know what you have planned for you.

24
00:36:29,790 --> 00:36:40,209
They tell about. Some who usually come here, come here first serving a polar bears and a fellow to the big star.

25
00:36:40,210 --> 00:36:43,230
But never lose out fans in same.

26
00:36:44,630 --> 00:36:52,240
Jones is in. My God, it's like a simple like a slip of my face cover was moving.

27
00:36:52,240 --> 00:36:57,520
When I'm moving, the family's doing whatever I make it stuck in the president and in the government text at my.

28
00:36:58,710 --> 00:37:04,990
The check in the fritz. When I'm breaking the camera, you get you. My people so scared about this push to tell me what to do.

29
00:37:06,050 --> 00:37:11,510
Show your showroom. We show your. What a hypocrite say what community feel.

30
00:37:11,510 --> 00:37:14,920
They don't want anyone to believe in what a hypocrite said, what community feel.

31
00:37:14,930 --> 00:37:30,840
They don't really want to owe you an to take your good, entertaining friends when they can't see your life later that day.

32
00:37:31,370 --> 00:37:34,660
What the [INAUDIBLE] is council voted down. Say what I want.

33
00:37:34,820 --> 00:37:38,959
But you'll never. Someday I'll down to practice like a kitten.

34
00:37:38,960 --> 00:37:42,470
Or watch. Only dog. Oh, you were a critic.

35
00:37:42,470 --> 00:38:20,430
Very protocol, [INAUDIBLE]. Oh.
