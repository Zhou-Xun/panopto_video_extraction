1
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:14,000
Okay, Good morning. Everyone let's get started but first we'll go review.

2
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:22,000
The quiz for electrified

3
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:28,000
So this from now on the quiz will be more technical right?

4
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:39,000
Because the you know the the lectures are more technical So there's some calculation might be need so question one.

5
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:48,000
There are 2 populations, A. and B, they're normal showing the figure, and then ask you about the plausible value of me and standard deviation for each.

6
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:55,000
And there are 4 different choices single single choice question i'm wondering.

7
00:05:55,000 --> 00:06:07,000
Anyone wants to tell us how you? if you are answer, I I think the the key is not absolutely guidelines, but want us to have a sort of a thinking process right?

8
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:15,000
How do you approach the question? So anyone wants to share

9
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:22,000
I can go, so so the B B will have like a like more.

10
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:41,000
A greater mean compared to a and because the central line, like the center of point, is towards the right of a and standard deviation, the more the standard deviation, the wider the histogram.

11
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:49,000
So B has like a Yeah, so B has like a tenor.

12
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:54,000
I mean the wick is less so That's why standard deviation is less.

13
00:06:54,000 --> 00:07:04,000
Yeah, which one do you pick? It has then maintained standard deviation 2 and the D has mean 15 because it's on the right.

14
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:08,000
And then standard deviation one because the vit is Yes. Yup.

15
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:19,000
That is correct. thank you very much and you're absolutely right you know There, there's no access there's no number, so we can only compare them sort of visually right these on the right hand side of 8.

16
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:23,000
So B has a larger mean, but all of them here. we had a larger meet.

17
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:27,000
So it's not really talent right now v here is not really the mean here.

18
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:36,000
It's not really accounting and then these narrower So if you remember what how long costs that a deviation measure, how wide the distribution is.

19
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:43,000
The standard division is about the distance from the mean to the side measure and the shoulder right again.

20
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:47,000
Here we have no access, so we don't we can only compare them relatively.

21
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:51,000
It seems here way A is about twice as wide as B.

22
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:56,000
So the standard division of A should be about twice as wide bigger than B.

23
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:59,000
So the only choice would be, Hey, you has a Sd.

24
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
Of 2 B has Sd. one, or hey as a Sd.

25
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:05,000
Of 5 he has as the one, the other 2 in the other 2.

26
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:14,000
B. has a larger standard deviation that's absolutely wrong So 2 versus one versus 5, or this one, I think 2 versus one thing, so that of the to the visual here.

27
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:27,000
So the crack answer is, is the first one. Any question

28
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:40,000
Okay, Now, that's more into the second the second is a little harder because it's a multiple choice question i'll populations has age that's a normal distributed was mean 40 standard deviation.

29
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:44,000
Attack. So this is this is an assumption, Right? just take for granted.

30
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:49,000
Yeah, So like all the following statement, so there's a multiple toys about the population.

31
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:59,000
Okay, So let's go over one by one a 95% confidence interval for the population mean is 2060.

32
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:07,000
Anyone think this is right or wrong, just let me know

33
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:13,000
And why I mean more important than what? Why do you think so?

34
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:19,000
I think this is wrong. because the okay dance integral is based.

35
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:31,000
A study with and the statistics. It it has, like the link of the samples, the standard deviation under the number, the sample set.

36
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:36,000
So this information has actually not given in the yeah in the text.

37
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:44,000
So we can say that because yeah, this is yeah, this is based on the study and the statistics. Thank you.

38
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:49,000
Yeah, you're absolutely right to compute the company number we need a sample.

39
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,000
Remember the fault, the formula for combatable required sample size.

40
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:56,000
Here we have no sample at all, so we just cannot possibly compute this.

41
00:09:56,000 --> 00:10:04,000
In fact, this interval is the interval cover 95% of the population, but does not cover 95%.

42
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:07,000
Confidence for the poverty. I mean so it's a different interval.

43
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:15,000
Thank you very much. So this is wrong. second one. The population has far more people age 10, and younger than it has people, age, 70 or older.

44
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:26,000
Anyone has some thought about this we can't necessarily assume that it's just tan or younger, because maybe the

45
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:34,000
The mean is being pulled down. Maybe by 20 year old so you just don't know exactly where that age group is falling that might make the mean lower cool. Thanks.

46
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:44,000
So I think this is false. Right? Yes, yeah, your absolute anybody has a different argument about it.

47
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:56,000
I also think it's. false. but I think it's because 10 and younger, and 70, and older are both 3 standard deviations away from the means.

48
00:10:56,000 --> 00:11:03,000
So they would have an equal number of people assuming that This is a well, it says it's normally distributed.

49
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:07,000
Both are 3 stations away. Thank you, Barnum. Yeah, both of you are right.

50
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:12,000
That this is false. so it's already given this is normal distribution.

51
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:22,000
So you know, believe or not, this is the assumption. right So if it's normal distributed is symmetric power shape, and then both 10 and 7 years 3 standard deviation. weight.

52
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:28,000
So the left tail on the right tail. beyond 3 side of the beach on the polar is symmetric, so they should have the same amount of population.

53
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:33,000
There. So this is a bomb. Thank you both awful answering.

54
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:39,000
So the third 1, 95% of population is between H, 20 and 60.

55
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:53,000
Anyone wants to answer this one

56
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:59,000
I believe that's true based on the sample with 40 as the mean.

57
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:05,000
So to stand deviations away would be 20 and 60 awesome.

58
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:09,000
You're absolutely right. Yeah, I mean this is 2 standard deviation from the meet.

59
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:15,000
So this range should cover 900 of the population you're absolutely right. just one minor correction.

60
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:19,000
This you know you you set face on the sample But there's no sample based on them population.

61
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:32,000
Otherwise you're perfect, Thank you number 4 50% of the population is 8, 40, or below anyone.

62
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:43,000
I thought this was Think not not correct, because you can say that if the median is 40.

63
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:47,000
But, yeah, we don't know if the media is the same as the mean.

64
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:52,000
Thank you. Thank you very much. Yeah, I think you made a very good argument.

65
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,000
This is about a median, not a mean, nevertheless.

66
00:12:54,000 --> 00:13:02,000
That there is a you know, one step further to to to argue on this one, and anybody has a different thought.

67
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:10,000
It was true, because go ahead. yeah i'll go ahead.

68
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:19,000
Sorry I was gonna say I thought it was true, because in this normal distributed population we kind of assume the mean and the media are the same alright.

69
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:24,000
So then that would make the statement true. with the 50% of the population is below that.

70
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:39,000
Thank you. Thank you, Rebecca. Do you think the same thing or definitely,

71
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:45,000
The population was aged. what can below? Yup: Yeah, both of you are right.

72
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:55,000
Yeah, I think all of you are right, you know, recognizing this is about a meeting or one step further, because the normal normal distribution is symmetric, therefore mean, always default in the meeting.

73
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:58,000
So meetings also 40. So this is correct. Yeah, I mean this.

74
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:02,000
All of these are asking about your your knowledge about the normal distribution.

75
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:13,000
And then the final one sample join from the population are more likely to have people under age 30 than above 8, 60 final one.

76
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:24,000
Anyone

77
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:35,000
That that's true, because 30 is within one standard deviation and 60 is above the second second standard deviation.

78
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:44,000
So yeah, you're right 30 is one standard deviation left the left side of the mean 62 standard deviation rice out of me. Right?

79
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:48,000
So if you think about it, you know I don't wanna I probably don't have time to draw it.

80
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:55,000
But if you think about the bell shape right the the the tail below 30 is larger than the payload of 60.

81
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:59,000
Just think about the shape of the model time, all of you.

82
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:04,000
This is awesome. Now let's move on question 3 Yeah, you have question.

83
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:09,000
Please let me know. Otherwise I move on here you know there's a lot of number here.

84
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:16,000
Some of them are useful, some of them now. So really this is a ask you to pick on a number which are useful for you as a question.

85
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:26,000
Right. So new mindfulness, technique for managing chronic pain is being studying the sample of one man who have had plans.

86
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:32,000
Her I don't know what this is that's the artist for over a year for each of 30 days.

87
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:37,000
Each man records an integer from 0 no hand to 10 extreme pain.

88
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:44,000
I think that's the standard right measuring pay and average of the 30 day is the pain level reported for each of the line or men.

89
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:49,000
The data produce a sample mean pain. Level 4.2 with the standard deviation sample, standard deviation, 3 for all.

90
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:54,000
What is the lower bomb for the 95%, Hollywood for the main pain level in the public domain.

91
00:15:54,000 --> 00:16:01,000
Man using this legal technique. So there are a lot of numbers, for many of them are not now useful, right?

92
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,000
So you can pick out a number which you think are useful.

93
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:06,000
So anyone wants to tell me not just the final answer, but rather, how?

94
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:17,000
How do you calculate

95
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:32,000
I can take this one. So it's it's asking us for the lower bound of the 95% confidence interval which we know lies within 2 cents standard deviation. the formula for confidence interval tells

96
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:49,000
us that it's a mean plus or minus 2 times standard deviation over the square root of the sample size In this case the sample size was 100 so the scroll boot up at his time are 2 times 3 which is 2

97
00:16:49,000 --> 00:17:02,000
standard deviation is over. 10 is point 6, and let me see point 6 times 2 is 1 point, 2.

98
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:12,000
So 4.2 minus 1.2 I think it's 3.6,

99
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:19,000
I think. Yeah. Okay. 4.2 minus 2 times 3 point.

100
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:26,000
Oh, divided by square root of 100 right so that's the 3, number 4, point 2, 3, point Oh, and 100.

101
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:29,000
That's the 3 number you can use and then once you do the calculation.

102
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:35,000
That will be, you know, 3.6. so some of you might get a formula correct.

103
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:40,000
But you know, somehow you made a mistake in the calculation that's very unfortunate, because you know,

104
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:44,000
The online quiz that doesn't know your partner or only do private number.

105
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:47,000
But you need to pick careful right? Well, not in the last.

106
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:53,000
I think more importantly, is to they got the number to use right 4 point, 2, 3, point home, and 100.

107
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:59,000
The rest of the number, for example, 30 day. All of those do not matter.

108
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:06,000
Question here

109
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:17,000
Alright. Finally, again, a multiple toys let's take it slow cause some of you made the mistakes it's totally fine to make mistakes. You know the key start to to understand you know why you made a mistake.

110
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:32,000
And correct that right that's the point of the quest So a study records a 95% common number of 5 and 8 from 5 to 8 for the mean number of missed days of school per month how the natural school children living in

111
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:41,000
poverty. and then, if I all the correct statements, the law related to this company number right? So, just like the previous one, this one is about your knowledge about poverty.

112
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:45,000
Number right, give you a common level for a particular thing. What do you know about it?

113
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:51,000
Right for the first one. The sample mean from the study must have been 6.5 days.

114
00:18:51,000 --> 00:19:14,000
Anyone want to say something about this

115
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:24,000
I can see this. I think that's correct I I can have this because of the simulation in the simulation.

116
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:29,000
We had all the bars, and then there were the blue dots which had them mean, and they were the central points.

117
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:33,000
So I kind of thought that so that's a combat in the

118
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:41,000
The meeting will be the central point. from the the 2 extreme limits, like 5 and 8, and then the central point would be 6, 6.5 days.

119
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:47,000
So that's how I came to the conclusion what i'm not sure if that's that's my luck.

120
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:52,000
The reasoning is right thank you you're you're absolutely right. I mean, let me clean off the you know the the language a little bit.

121
00:19:52,000 --> 00:20:05,000
But you're absolutely right There is a study we know nothing about a study. We don't know the sample size. We don't know the me understand the Db: right so if they use the same formula as we're using class right

122
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:10,000
this car minimum is is the mean plus minus 2 standard deviation divided by square root of N.

123
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:13,000
If they use that formula I mean, they very likely will use.

124
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:19,000
Then you will know that the mean is always in the center of this interval.

125
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:22,000
But that's one step beyond what you're learning cause we're not talking about this right?

126
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,000
So this is a little bit. Yeah, I want to talk about.

127
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:34,000
But if you recognize the mean it's, always at the side of the interval, and the sign of this interval is 6.5, so you would be able to re inversely figure out the mean for the study must be 6 point.

128
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:40,000
5. So so, if you remember, I showed a simulation. you need a class.

129
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:44,000
The bar right, the the blue dot is always at the middle of the bar.

130
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:51,000
That's all. Also clear from the phone. number right so this is a little tricky, because I didn't you exactly talk about this back.

131
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:56,000
But you know that require a little bit deep pron understanding of how we do this.

132
00:20:56,000 --> 00:21:04,000
So it's okay. that I didn't pick this up but you know but I think now we should be able to to know why this is the case. now.

133
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:20,000
Second one. It is highly unlikely that the actual populator mean is, too, anyone

134
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:29,000
I said that that was true because of how far away from the mean, the number 2 is right.

135
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:34,000
So the 95% confidence intervals at 5.

136
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:43,000
And so this would be even further below that. So that decreases the possibility that this is the actual numbers, too.

137
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:52,000
So based on our numbers, Anything outside of the chances of anything being outside of 5 to 8, we said, was maybe 5% right.

138
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:57,000
But then, this number being 2, is significantly below that 95% confidence interval.

139
00:21:57,000 --> 00:22:01,000
So I would say that it's unlikely you're absolutely right.

140
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:13,000
Yeah, I mean, I totally agree with your argument. I would just tighten off the language a little bit, because you know, once you'll start talking about the chance that you know the the value is outside is 5% technically that's not correct because you

141
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:21,000
know the number is either email not there's no probability but nevertheless, I totally got your argument right.

142
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:28,000
So it's very likely the number is in there therefore, it's very unlikely numbers all there, right, you you know.

143
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:33,000
If we repeat the experiment a 100 times, then 95 at the time, the number will be in the interval right.

144
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:38,000
So we still don't know exactly number that's why we say very unlikely.

145
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:48,000
We don't know for sure, but we have confidence that's why this is the common Thank you very much. Yeah, I just don't want you to talk about probability, because as soon as the part of our probability is very easy to get

146
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:52,000
get the sentence technically wrong. But but never mind.

147
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:58,000
Yeah, the you know, your argument is totally correct. Thank you so much.

148
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:07,000
And the third one, the actual population means has a probability of point 9 5 being between 5 and 8 days.

149
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:10,000
That's actually you know just going back to what I just popped along.

150
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:22,000
Anyone want to try on this one? Yeah, so we can say that it's a probability point 99.9, 5.

151
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:33,000
What we can say that if we repeat the studies with the same method for a 100 or 1095 studies, we'll have the

152
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:41,000
The true value will be in days integral for about 95, or Thomas.

153
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:45,000
Oh, the study. Thank you. Yeah, you are absolutely right, you know.

154
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:48,000
It seems very much correct by a fortunately packet.

155
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:53,000
It is wrong. because this is the fixed interval. Once, you know, the number is already fixed.

156
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:58,000
Right, and then the population means, although the unknown is also a fixed number.

157
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:03,000
So the mean is either in here or not in here there's no probability around with fixed numbers.

158
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:09,000
Oh, wow! so that's so the only way to talk about probabilities is it's thinking about repeated sampling.

159
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:14,000
That's the frequency approach so unfortunately this is wrong although it looked very much.

160
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:22,000
Is it? just, you know, forget, to review what I call my call right? it's very easy to say something wrong about the commonly level.

161
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:32,000
Yeah. accounts of interpretation. Number 4, 95% of children in the study missed the 25 and 8 days of the school per month.

162
00:24:32,000 --> 00:25:02,000
Anyone else to try on this

163
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:16,000
I think this is fault, because the confidence interval doesn't tell us what percent of our sampling lies between that range.

164
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:23,000
The standard deviation could give us a sense of that, like 2 standard deviation should contain 97% of our sampling.

165
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:26,000
But the confidence interval I Don't think tells us the same thing.

166
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:38,000
Thank you very much. we. We kind of have different thoughts on same South, did you? Hmm, No, I I was gonna say that.

167
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:41,000
I think that that yeah, that's exactly what I was thinking was over.

168
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:54,000
95% of the children. So this talks So in the the question means that every time the mean there is a problem like 95% of the time the mean will be between 5 and 8 but it doesn't talk

169
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:59,000
about the children. So yeah, thank you both. Yeah, you both are correct, right to talk about this.

170
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:05,000
We need to know the population standard deviation which we don't this interval is about the population meet, right?

171
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:17,000
So these are different different quality. Thank you very much. So finally, if the study study twice as many children at the common level would be twice as wide.

172
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:21,000
This is a hypothetical right if we we know nothing about a study.

173
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:25,000
But if we, you know, increase the sample size by 2, would the interval be twice as wide?

174
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:33,000
Or for now anyone

175
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:42,000
No. Because if if you look at the equation or standard duration, it has a square root of n in the denominator.

176
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:53,000
And so you would have to. increase the the sample size by 4 times if you want to decrease the common civilization by 2.

177
00:26:53,000 --> 00:27:00,000
Absolutely. Yeah, Thank you so much. Yeah, that's exactly the point here, I mean, you need to look at an equation.

178
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:08,000
But the less the width of the interval rolls at the square root of the sample size not not rule actually applies to almost everything we're doing.

179
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:16,000
Statistics, the the amount of information to say the amount of information grow with sample size for the accuracy. Right? I'm!

180
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:22,000
Certainly I could grow at the square root. We talk about that many times you know.

181
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:25,000
Apply to to everything with talk about. we'll cover later thank you very much.

182
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:38,000
It is great, perfect. Any question about is, please awesome.

183
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:42,000
Yeah, I think it's important that we have lectures But but it's, I think, even more important we have exercise.

184
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:47,000
And the review that exercise that's where I think the real learning happens.

185
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:50,000
You try it. I make mistakes on correct. No mistake.

186
00:27:50,000 --> 00:28:01,000
Those kind of things. I think i'm more important okay that's continuous electron on all the testing

187
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:09,000
So last time we talk about how passing being a different way of making statistical inference, and the setup of the passing is to have a a No.

188
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:14,000
Have office, and the alternative hypothesis right There's H. A.

189
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:22,000
And h h not an H. A. stands for the null and alternative, and they are asymmetric right building.

190
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:29,000
And the I also use the port analogy right the knowledge that is innocent is assumed by default.

191
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:34,000
You don't need to have with us to to prove the now, and you never prove them.

192
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:46,000
Now you try to you're trying to decide whether you have you're not having to go against the know or not go against them all that's what you're trying to decide so you never prove to know and there 200 error

193
00:28:46,000 --> 00:29:01,000
we make hypothesis You'll reject it Now, where are you shooting and top 2 areas that you fail to reject the know where you should have rejected right so different type of arrow. But also called thoughts active and false negative

194
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:05,000
because the null and the alternative, they are as the magic.

195
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:09,000
Therefore the 2 type error also is the metric in principle which we take type.

196
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:15,000
One error more seriously I wouldn't say we take both seriously. we prioritize in controlling pipeline.

197
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:20,000
We don't want to hypothetize one or go out of control. right?

198
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:25,000
So what we do is I would set a small percentage or probability or type.

199
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:28,000
One error will happen. We call it alpha. Usually we take 5%.

200
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:39,000
So we kind of accommodate 5% type on narrow rate, and then we try to reduce type 2 error. i'll talk about how to do that About usually type.

201
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:46,000
2 arrow 20%, we think. are good enough okay so that's that's where you can see we take pipe on error.

202
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:54,000
More seriously right, cannot afford very high p one now and Now let's move on to the to the new conference.

203
00:29:54,000 --> 00:30:00,000
Right. So the end of the day you make precision, and then you can have a table like this.

204
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:05,000
This table show up in many different places. So you think about that. I will slow down.

205
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:08,000
How about it? This table? This is essentially a contingency table.

206
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:15,000
If you do the past many, many times, and have counts here, but now you know it's not there yet.

207
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:18,000
So on a rose. okay, on the columns we have 2 column.

208
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:25,000
That's the state of nature which just like the parameter of the population is something there existed.

209
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:38,000
But we don't know right so the 2 column are now being true. for now being forced, which you know means that alternative being true, this is something we want to know, but we never know for sure. But we nevertheless.

210
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:44,000
We collect data clacking information right clock evidence trying to say something about the nature.

211
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:50,000
I. Then the 2 rows are our our conclusion, the first rule saying, we do not reject the No.

212
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:53,000
Remember we never accept it now. We never proved to know.

213
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:58,000
We only decide whether we reject now in favor of the alternative or we don't reject now.

214
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:05,000
But they say, we have no evidence of declaring beauty, or we have enough evidence of the current.

215
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:10,000
You. We don't really prove some somebody is innocent so do not reject it now.

216
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:20,000
It's like we cannot prove duty I rejected now means we have enough evidence, you know, proving duty.

217
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:27,000
So, because we might make mistakes right so there are 2 4 type of outcome.

218
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:34,000
So there's a chance when make a type one error which means the no is true, but nevertheless we reject it.

219
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:39,000
That's false positive. so all the control is ready to be to be out right.

220
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:45,000
Similarly, there's a rate of high 2 error which is the null is false, but we fail to reject it.

221
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:52,000
That's that's beta similarly you know the time to know is true, and we fail to reject it.

222
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:57,000
That's one minus alpha and when the noise for false or reject is one minus beta right?

223
00:31:57,000 --> 00:32:00,000
That's type one error rate that's type 2 error rate.

224
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:05,000
But from this table there are many things which can be calculated for those of you are familiar with passing.

225
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:10,000
You know there are sensitivity, specificity, you know, and you know.

226
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:13,000
How they predicted value 90 predicted by your post discovery rate.

227
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:20,000
There are so many variable that compute can be computed from this table, and I never really remember all the when I when I ran into something.

228
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:24,000
I'm not, I mean I just look up online right if you you know.

229
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:31,000
Go on, Wikipedia for example let's say sensitivity.

230
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:39,000
No terminology are more used by people in, you know, in diagnosis. literature, right?

231
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:49,000
If you come here right there is a there's so many quality you have computer problem table, so that's the go down right?

232
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:54,000
So this is the table I just talk about. Wow! predict the condition right?

233
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:58,000
And the tool condition, they actually transpose the table. So the roles are.

234
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:01,000
My roles are their column, and their roles are my call.

235
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:05,000
This is a 2 Bible table here, right? but there are just so many other poly that you can compute.

236
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:15,000
I'm not going to talk about them is beyond the scope and also I don't remember all of them, but you'll see that there are different formulas right and there's a list here That's Why, I

237
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:19,000
always use Wikipedia to help me Right there is a

238
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:22,000
Sensitivity is also called a recall also called you know true positive rate.

239
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:26,000
And so also for there's so many of them you're a computer.

240
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:30,000
But depend on different usage. you can do a different thing, but in the end try to understand.

241
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:33,000
There are concepts that false, positive, false, negative right.

242
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:37,000
Those are the key thing underlying any past like this.

243
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:40,000
Right yeah, i'm just i'm gonna skip this.

244
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:48,000
But this is not part of the past. just show you know that There's of deep literature and knowledge around this table.

245
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:52,000
Okay, here we focus on boss, possibly a false negative, you know.

246
00:33:52,000 --> 00:34:02,000
Have all the testing framework. Okay, if you do diagnosis, passing that, you may have to worry about sanitation specifically, even you know, you know, partly predictive value.

247
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:07,000
Yeah, at that time

248
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:10,000
Yeah, a touchdown. To illustrate why we do.

249
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:14,000
We need all of this quantity, right? So the type, one error is the probability.

250
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:26,000
You make up the mistake one. So now, is True, but basically computer property along this call the type of had 2 areas. The probably you'll make a mistake within now is false.

251
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:35,000
But you do it horizontal right the problem you'll make an arrow when you decide something it's true or false.

252
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:46,000
Then that will give you a specificity and so on so so they're they're just the many different quality you can compute

253
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:55,000
Yeah, you have a question. Please let me know otherwise i'll continue So the way we make our decision is again to draw a sample and collect the data.

254
00:34:55,000 --> 00:35:01,000
So all the sampling scheme, like simple, random sample, unbiasedness, all of those still apply here.

255
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:09,000
So everything is, Depend on the on the sample, right. If your sample is buying everything you do will be biased afterward.

256
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:13,000
And based on the phone and the data, we may we do some inference?

257
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:18,000
And Dick the torment of the data conflict with the null or not. right?

258
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:25,000
So the way we do that is to compute something out of the data, and the particular thing we compute is called a pile.

259
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:28,000
The P. value just a number we compute, and the P.

260
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:43,000
By always range, you know, between 0 and one. so typically 0 means, you know, the smaller the P value can see that there are stronger evidence against the non.

261
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:49,000
I know it's a little bit you know conferences but the smaller the P.

262
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:55,000
Value the stronger of the evidence against them. all Okay, just have to remember.

263
00:35:55,000 --> 00:36:01,000
Now I know it's counterintuitive for those who are not familiar with by essentially key value. the P.

264
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:05,000
Stands for probability. The pivot, indeed, is a probability.

265
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:08,000
Okay again. the definition is a little long. so you have to.

266
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:13,000
You know, gather on that. But but P by is the probability. Right?

267
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:20,000
Is the probability of the data. You can only talk about probability with random quantity. And the data is random, right?

268
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:27,000
So the P value is the probability of some statistic computing from the data.

269
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:34,000
So to capital pivot, we need to first capital the statistic, and then figure out the sample distribution of that statistic, then calculate by right.

270
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:37,000
So the pivot is the probability of some some statistic.

271
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:40,000
You know, you observe from your data in this particular case.

272
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:45,000
We talk about X bar, which is the sample mean, which is the statistic right.

273
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:50,000
But the pivotal calls are generalized for any statistics, and it's the statistic will have a sample distribution.

274
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:53,000
Then you can do the P. value, not the last. Here we use. expon. Right?

275
00:36:53,000 --> 00:37:00,000
So in this case, Key by. tell us how my, how likely my observed X bar, or more extreme values, right, more larger values.

276
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:07,000
It might be you are when the population is supposed to know. you know other words right.

277
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:10,000
Assuming that now is true. Remember we don't do not approve the now.

278
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:24,000
We just assume it all right, assuming that now it's true, how likely, or how unlikely, whatever that you see a statistic or sample mean as extreme as the one you saw in your data.

279
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:33,000
That's the key value. So by stream I mean very big. some of me in magnitude is a very small one, or very large one, right?

280
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:47,000
The magnitude. but posts are extreme, if the pio is small, which means assuming that now it's true, we are very unlikely to see a sample in as as extreme as the one we just saw that we use proof by

281
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:55,000
contradiction. Hi not give us the inference that's saying probably the know is not too so.

282
00:37:55,000 --> 00:38:06,000
I will give you a horizontal right e you and me are playing again, and I I we flip a point right if it's a Ha!

283
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:14,000
I give you $5 if the tail you give me $5, I just tell you my point is unbiased is a pair of coin that's a fair game.

284
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:19,000
So we play pipe, and then after a while you know there's something weird, right?

285
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:30,000
Say we play the game £10 and all the 9 time I one you start adopt that i'm cheating.

286
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:44,000
But the basis of doubting is that you just don't believe if if for a fair coin I can get 9 out of pen grows out of a of a tail, So basically the pio framework mimic that right but make

287
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:58,000
it more qualitatively. You What you did is that you compute the probability that if the coin is really fair, you could be the probability that for a fair point to get 9 out of 10 press you need to be super

288
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:12,000
outlooking right you need to do it like a 10,000 times to hit once like that, and you just don't believe you are that a lot to make that happen that day and You're off.

289
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:24,000
You are your new prince, or your conclusion will be. I was cheating right that that kind of a argument like below every Hi, Paula, passing right, we first assume the knowledge too, right without evidence.

290
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:31,000
I assume you are innocent, right? we assume the now is true. I look at the data and compute what's the chance? I'm.

291
00:39:31,000 --> 00:39:37,000
Seeing something like this, or more extreme landlords and Then you've got chance.

292
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:43,000
That probably is super low. Then I start without my assumption that now is true.

293
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:48,000
Okay, that's the that's the argument on the line of Pbi approach.

294
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:51,000
You know this is the power approach i'll talk about a lot of history.

295
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:57,000
This whole approach, you know, came about like a 100 years ago by, you know.

296
00:39:57,000 --> 00:40:03,000
The the the founder of mothers statistics.

297
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:07,000
One of those are efficient, right? So this is the real story I think it's documenting in the literature.

298
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:22,000
So Fisher was a was an Englishman, and he was speaking with with a lady right, and that lady claims now she can tell by by tasting a mule key. a lady claims that by painting of your key Milky she

299
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:30,000
can tell whether the mute was added after the P. or the tea was added after the milk, and fisher doesn't believe it so.

300
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:36,000
What what he did have a key design experiment. He he made 8 cops on your P.

301
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:38,000
4 of them. you add milk before the tea.

302
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:49,000
The other 4 he had P. before the milk, and he randomly shot for the 8 cup of tea, and then let the lady paste a lot of the lady. say you know how many times she really got it.

303
00:40:49,000 --> 00:41:01,000
By. I forgot the the the the full story. but the lady, I think, got some of them around right more than hot, but still not enough for feature to to be different.

304
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:07,000
So in the end. Feature can be the p value showing it's i'm sorry I likely to actually know the truth.

305
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:13,000
So that's the way you know that's a that's a real story document, you know, in the first place right.

306
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:15,000
So with some of the claim they can do something. You trust them.

307
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:25,000
First, that then design the experiment, correct data, and and prove that if they are true that whatever you got from your data will be very unlikely to happen.

308
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:31,000
You never know for sure whether they they really, you know, are saying telling the truth or not.

309
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:37,000
But the data tell you give you enough evidence in in rejecting the the know.

310
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:40,000
Okay, So in the end, once we compute the P value.

311
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:49,000
If the pio is small enough which we say our data and all of us do not agree with each other, one of them must be wrong, so we trust the data versus null.

312
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:57,000
So we reject it all based on the data so that's the whole thought process again, because it's proof by contradiction.

313
00:41:57,000 --> 00:42:05,000
And there's probability involved sometimes is a little bit hard on the sign but that's the whole process.

314
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:12,000
So here we'll say we say small enough or How small is small right for any of this kind of question.

315
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:16,000
We just have to arbitrarily set the color and turns out to cut out.

316
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:21,000
Most people use, actually dated back again to Ri Fisher.

317
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:30,000
He suggested this or people you know around him suggested this that we we put 5% that's 0 point 0 5 as a cut off.

318
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:36,000
So if the P bio computed it's last time 0 point 0 5 we reject them all.

319
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:46,000
It turns out that this caught up will give us guarantee on top one that we right if we reject the now at the call out key by 0 point 0 5.

320
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:56,000
If we do everything according to the the textbook sort of framework, the procedure we compute pivotal correctly, then we have a guarantee type on error rate.

321
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:59,000
Alpha control at 5%. so that's what we wanted to achieve.

322
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:08,000
In the first place, right? So in the end, how approach would be that collective design experiment and collect the data computer statistic.

323
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:16,000
And you know, study that something distributed a statistic computer keyword out of it, and then you pivot the last time to prescribe the alpha where you reject it now.

324
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:19,000
Otherwise we failed to reject. now. so look at here.

325
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:24,000
We fail to reject. Now, when the piece larger than Alpha is not the same that we we prove to know.

326
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:32,000
We can have approved to know. We just failed to detect it

327
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:42,000
Any questions so far

328
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:55,000
So apparently this at all. No matter how why did he use i'll see. Maybe reasonable is the arbitrary call out, after all right, why 5%?

329
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:59,000
Why not 4%? Why not 10% right there's no answer to that?

330
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:03,000
People just take it you have to pick a cut off to make a decision right?

331
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:07,000
The p value itself is continuous, just like a company level, is a quantitative manager, so the P.

332
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:15,000
Value itself measures the evidence against the Now by Indiana we have to make a decision that optimize our pivotal, make a decision.

333
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:21,000
Will we? Any time will be dichotomizing or continuous number? right?

334
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:26,000
We make the conclusion more more convenient, easy to understand, interpretable.

335
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:32,000
But we also lose information right after all. the P value of 0 point 4, 9, and the Pv.

336
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:39,000
Was 0 point 5 one. They contain almost all the same amount of information against them all.

337
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:42,000
Funny. I'm not with probably a different conclusion right Keep that in mind.

338
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:54,000
The pivot is not a gold standard it's just a convenience way, boss will make a conclusion, because many times we just have to make a conclusion to move our because I have to decide whether to approve the

339
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:58,000
vaccine or not, They cannot say yeah you know it's fine.

340
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:03,000
They cannot say that they have to approve or not right, although the data is continuous.

341
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:09,000
So keep that in mind

342
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:20,000
Okay, So what have you made the decision? you may it's probably you know It's it's it's random, which means that if this in this experiment you got a key value of 0 point 0.

343
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:24,000
4. it's very likely the next one if you repeat it got 0 point 0 6.

344
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:33,000
I know your component will flip so just because you made a conclusion doesn't mean it's absolutely correct.

345
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:41,000
There's always a chance you make it type one of have to arrow, and you'll never really know whether you made an error or not.

346
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:55,000
Okay, Unfortunately, that's the nature right so we always do do all we can right, trying to minimize the error rate, or we can never eliminate on Alright, just like confidence in the book.

347
00:45:55,000 --> 00:46:00,000
There are many, many way of misunderstanding the P.

348
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:09,000
Value, some of them largely wrong, some of them, you know, not so wrong, but still technically well, I just talk about the P.

349
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:19,000
Value is the probability of observing that's the statistic We just saw in the data, or something more extreme under the assumption that no is correct.

350
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:24,000
So that's the right way of copy to the p value at least here.

351
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:33,000
You know it's. still under this repeated something of right because by probability we're thinking about observed data is random that only works when we repeat something.

352
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:42,000
But it is not like verbally building that the invitation Well, there are just so many way of stating the P.

353
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:48,000
Value wrong. Well, I don't know I'll just list a few wrong things, so be careful right.

354
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:58,000
Everything I list on this page, on the next One or wrong interpretation, so don't use them Number One fighting to reject the null, or a type of attorney.

355
00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:02,000
It means to know is true that's not true we can never approve.

356
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:11,000
But now it's true we can only say we have you not having us go against it in particular.

357
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:20,000
If we collect very little data. For example, sample size is very small, though we have very little power in this case, we we also fail to reject them.

358
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:32,000
Now, so we failed to reject the no Oh, could could simply means that we don't have enough data in reality.

359
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:40,000
Actually, if you clack more and more data, you have higher high power, you eventually you will reject it now, because if you think about right.

360
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:47,000
And no it's just a point all of this in many case we assume the null is like mu equals 8 other view.

361
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:54,000
Can that be perfectly 8? bye? If you if you collect like infinite data, you will always reject it.

362
00:47:54,000 --> 00:48:03,000
Now, but rejecting now is with tons of data it's actually not very useful, because you're you have a You are overpowering yourself alright.

363
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:09,000
So, for example, you'll have You not have It and showing the noise is about 0 8.0.

364
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:16,000
One you have enough data asked me, though. Okay, your mean is it's above 0 point.

365
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:18,000
8 0 0, 8.0 0 one and then reject.

366
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:33,000
The now of the mu equals 8 that's pretty much useless right, because at that that level of difference it doesn't make a difference in practice. right so just reject them out to be your overpowering cell and fail to reject

367
00:48:33,000 --> 00:48:38,000
now, which means they are underpowering itself. I keep that in mind.

368
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:42,000
The the P. by you simply measure the chance you know we observe something more straight.

369
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:52,000
It doesn't really say about the practical application of the particular impact not require, you know, the main knowledge.

370
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:56,000
Second thing, the Pv. is the probably that no is true.

371
00:48:56,000 --> 00:49:01,000
This is incorrect, because the know is either true or not true.

372
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:06,000
It's something we never observed, but not with the last is fixed.

373
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:14,000
This is not right now. you can only talk about probability with random quantity in this whole framework only the data is random.

374
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:18,000
So the Peabody is the property of something to do with the data.

375
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:26,000
It's not something to do with the hypothesis

376
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:30,000
So the pivotal, again, is the poverty of the observe, the statistic, or even more extreme values.

377
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:44,000
Assuming that now is true, it's not about the No and then a pivot less than 0 point 0 5 always prove that the alternative is true.

378
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:54,000
Again. we are not really proving anything We just use key value to make a decision, and our decision might possibly be wrong because they're type one and high to errors right?

379
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:58,000
The pivot just measured the strength of the evidence. Thank you.

380
00:49:58,000 --> 00:50:06,000
Favor of those horrible Go against them all but it doesn't prove it

381
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:09,000
Okay, that's why you would think about it you know we Cl.

382
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:14,000
Our best in the court. I will make the right decision, but not with the last.

383
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:18,000
We always made mistakes right. There are. There are many people who went to the day over.

384
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:23,000
After many years, we realize, you know, with more evidence realized we made the wrong decision. Right? they?

385
00:50:23,000 --> 00:50:37,000
They were innocent after all right, and that was the pipeline arrow we made right, and not to mention that we definitely set many criminals go free because we didn't have enough evidence that's possible right so even in

386
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:44,000
the court such a serious situation. We still make 2 type of mistakes, not for measuring, you know, other kind of scientific study, right?

387
00:50:44,000 --> 00:50:48,000
We we always make mistakes. We just try to reduce them but unfortunately, that's the nature right?

388
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:56,000
Sometimes we just cannot. oh, boy, make making his thanks

389
00:50:56,000 --> 00:51:07,000
Any questions.

390
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:22,000
Okay, Small p vio indicates large signal by signal here, I mean, this is the testing itself, right of interest.

391
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:31,000
This look almost correct, except that you will see later on that in a large signal usually give you a small key value.

392
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:35,000
But small key value may not really come from large signal. The P.

393
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:52,000
Value manager is the the the randomness right? The Peabody is usually determined by signal divided by noise, so the small key idle could mean the large thing, though Buck would also mean just being a small noise.

394
00:51:52,000 --> 00:52:00,000
So it's a single to noise ratio but which means that the pivot is determined by many different quality.

395
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:07,000
A large signal is just one of them. No other polynomial can give you a small key value, like, you know.

396
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:13,000
Last variation, large assembly, size, so on, and so forth, and those has nothing to do with single.

397
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:22,000
Therefore the qi, you know, do not really tell you things about the signal is a summary of many different things.

398
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:26,000
Okay, So yeah, a very tiny P value which could, just because you overpower yourself.

399
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:34,000
You have a super large sample size. The signal could still be very high

400
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:40,000
So pivot matters. the statistics will take any difference that's it.

401
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:57,000
It doesn't measure scientific or practical, significance so you have to look at your signal to determine whether you know the signal you measure is is significant, practical, Well, scientific, and that requires your own knowledge right for the problem of

402
00:52:57,000 --> 00:53:01,000
study.

403
00:53:01,000 --> 00:53:07,000
And the fixed one. The data shows a theory to be farther true.

404
00:53:07,000 --> 00:53:14,000
This is about the same kind of how about earlier right? The data provide evidence.

405
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:24,000
Both are, or review the theory or claim. but we cannot pull, or we cannot show that assumption is true enough, Right?

406
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:33,000
We can never be 100%. We only make up probabilistic statement.

407
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:43,000
So I'll give you there's a question to chat, asking, What do you mean by signal?

408
00:53:43,000 --> 00:53:50,000
Yeah, that goes back to the number one electron one, right? I may actually use a different the single actually come from.

409
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:53,000
You know the scientific community, not really in the Zoom meeting.

410
00:53:53,000 --> 00:53:55,000
So here I may use the different permanent audio.

411
00:53:55,000 --> 00:54:03,000
Essentially the signal means that you know the the quantity of scientific interest right, the larger the quantity, the the larger effect.

412
00:54:03,000 --> 00:54:10,000
But basically the the effect size, the signal means the you know the fact side of your magic.

413
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:22,000
For example, if if you're speaking a drop reducing blood pressure, the amount of broad pressure, it reduces is the signal right, it depends on the the question of interest, right?

414
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:27,000
Basically the the quality mattering that you back of interest that's part of single.

415
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:39,000
What i'm saying here is that a small key, by or may not directly mean you have a larger effect, may only mean, you know, may possibly only mean you have a very big sample on that.

416
00:54:39,000 --> 00:54:42,000
So also

417
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:46,000
So the P. value measure the statistical thing in the best.

418
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:55,000
It is what it is and that's only yet it doesn't matter the scientific

419
00:54:55,000 --> 00:55:05,000
I hope that has a question

420
00:55:05,000 --> 00:55:08,000
Yeah, you have a follow up question right i'll study with p by 0 point 0 4.

421
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:12,000
And then, otherwise pivotal 0 point 0 0 one or the same.

422
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:16,000
I wouldn't say they're the same we depend on what you mean by the same.

423
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:20,000
But there are many things can vary between study to study.

424
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:24,000
Maybe the second study has a larger sample time that give you a smaller key value.

425
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:31,000
Well, actually, in the in the second study you may have actually a smaller impact sign. right?

426
00:55:31,000 --> 00:55:40,000
So you know more about the study. not just one. Number Okay, I have a question.

427
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:48,000
So. So when we do the statistical analysis for like for my project, you should get

428
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:55,000
The the people who are marked with Asterix, and then they have, like 3 asteroids for 0 point 0 1.

429
00:55:55,000 --> 00:56:01,000
And then they're like 4, 4 0 point 0 0 one and then one for 0 point 0, 5, and the P. values.

430
00:56:01,000 --> 00:56:06,000
I I know about that, but I never understood, really understood the like.

431
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:10,000
The relevance of it can Is is there anything like?

432
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:18,000
Is it related to this that there'll be value some of the yeah, Thanks for the question.

433
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:23,000
You know I I? Yeah, I will answer question like this. very happy to do that.

434
00:56:23,000 --> 00:56:28,000
So, which I just talk about. Right pivot is a number between 0 and one.

435
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:35,000
The smaller the key value of the larger the evidence right? So sometimes people like to put a number there.

436
00:56:35,000 --> 00:56:43,000
But sometimes people just want to qualitatively say the evidence is weak, the evidence is strong, and so on, so forth.

437
00:56:43,000 --> 00:56:49,000
So what they do is that if they put the stars right one star, 2 star, 3 star foster, and so on and so forth.

438
00:56:49,000 --> 00:56:58,000
I'm hardly to to turn a continuous pile into the not stars, is kind of arbitrary, but people somehow, you know, have a couple of convention and some software.

439
00:56:58,000 --> 00:57:08,000
You know it varies from software to software, but usually, for example, if you provider is less than point or 5, they put one star saying is significant.

440
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:16,000
I keep out of last time. point Oh, one they put 2 stars saying it's, you know, moderate second any because if you are not some point oh, oh, one!

441
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:21,000
They put a 3 stars, or even 4 they say it's you know strongly significant. right?

442
00:57:21,000 --> 00:57:32,000
So basically they they convert into a few quantitative categories, so that they they try to understand how how strong the evidence is.

443
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:37,000
That's what they say. a different software might have different you know.

444
00:57:37,000 --> 00:57:42,000
Convention of turning this. So you know, look at software but now for the last.

445
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:49,000
So i'm saying, if you put this kind of stars in your figure right, it will be more rigorous.

446
00:57:49,000 --> 00:57:52,000
You define it right? What? What? the, what are the stars need?

447
00:57:52,000 --> 00:58:02,000
Exactly. Okay, thank you you're welcome but typically you know one star means point Oh, 5, 2 starring is 21.

448
00:58:02,000 --> 00:58:10,000
So on and so forth, that's sort of the convention

449
00:58:10,000 --> 00:58:16,000
You're welcome. Thanks for the question alright finally this one is the one I you know.

450
00:58:16,000 --> 00:58:24,000
I I just part of all right. The pivotal measures the pivotal right.

451
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:30,000
It doesn't imply sign pivot or public house or clinical, whatever importance it's a very different.

452
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:36,000
So pivot is determined by hi the signal or the effect. right?

453
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:41,000
You are measuring, but also determined by other things like variability, like sample signs and other things.

454
00:58:41,000 --> 00:58:46,000
Right, so queue I can cover all of them which is different from from from the rest.

455
00:58:46,000 --> 00:58:51,000
So pivot managers. How unlikely you're gonna see the same data.

456
00:58:51,000 --> 00:59:00,000
If you repeat it right, Basically, how much 12 you have a value of data given, there's some randomness in there, right?

457
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:07,000
It measures the signal versus the noise versus the right variability

458
00:59:07,000 --> 00:59:15,000
Okay, Some of this may be more clear after some examples or all the farmers.

459
00:59:15,000 --> 00:59:21,000
Let's now try to you know look at how do we really computer pivotal again.

460
00:59:21,000 --> 00:59:27,000
We use the same example of study. The sample mean the population, I mean right.

461
00:59:27,000 --> 00:59:38,000
So in the population, I mean sorry. Remember, we have a hot passing going back here. the know have us assume the population means, take a specific value.

462
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:44,000
And everything else is a alternative. We are working along this type of hypothesis right now.

463
00:59:44,000 --> 00:59:48,000
Lena will work on different kind of hypothesis.

464
00:59:48,000 --> 00:59:53,000
So in this case, again, we collect the data and compute 3 qualities.

465
00:59:53,000 --> 00:59:57,000
Some are mean X bar it's almost standard deviation as X.

466
00:59:57,000 --> 01:00:03,000
And sample size. And so using the 3 quality, we can come to the Pb: just like we got computer com.

467
01:00:03,000 --> 01:00:10,000
The integral. Most people don't call me the book depend on 3 quantity here.

468
01:00:10,000 --> 01:00:25,000
So what we do with that, remember? on the X bar we'll be close to mute right, which means that if you assume you'll take some value, Are you observed with X.

469
01:00:25,000 --> 01:00:33,000
Bar is very far away from it that's some evidence against the null head office. right?

470
01:00:33,000 --> 01:00:43,000
So the difference between you observed x bar and you assume the view the value of mu that's that's the the matter of you.

471
01:00:43,000 --> 01:00:47,000
5, the matter of strength or matter of signal. What are your part?

472
01:00:47,000 --> 01:00:57,000
So what we do is that we compare the value of mu in the null hypothesis right to our best guess of the population use, which is the Solomon exponent?

473
01:00:57,000 --> 01:01:01,000
So mu not is the number we assume. they know how obvious of me.

474
01:01:01,000 --> 01:01:06,000
So in this particular example we assume you're not equals 8, but it could be any value. Right?

475
01:01:06,000 --> 01:01:11,000
You don't have office this measures the signal or other in fact.

476
01:01:11,000 --> 01:01:24,000
But this by itself doesn't tell you how unlike you're gonna see something, because X bar has a variable right? even if X Bar is far away from you, or you not the one you assume the phone the value of zoom from

477
01:01:24,000 --> 01:01:33,000
you right, give me is far away. If the variability of X Bar itself is large, that it's possible for that to happen right?

478
01:01:33,000 --> 01:01:45,000
So the amount of evidence or the property that I, you observe this particular as far depend on the sampling distribution of expon, and we know the summary distribution of X bar.

479
01:01:45,000 --> 01:01:56,000
He is normally distributed right with the same meal as the population, but with the standard deviation as X over square event.

480
01:01:56,000 --> 01:02:05,000
So in this case we actually go a step further beyond the confidence interval, because in common interval we do not know the population mean.

481
01:02:05,000 --> 01:02:11,000
Oh, you have all the passing we still don't know the population mean, but we have assumption of it, and we can assume it.

482
01:02:11,000 --> 01:02:16,000
We can assume to know about this right under the now have like the population here.

483
01:02:16,000 --> 01:02:24,000
He's mule up the value of zoom So we know more about the family that you relax other than all I want.

484
01:02:24,000 --> 01:02:32,000
That give us the power of compute the probability which is the key by

485
01:02:32,000 --> 01:02:40,000
So now, what we do is that we compute this ratio x bar minus mu n, which is the measurement of Paul far away.

486
01:02:40,000 --> 01:02:53,000
X bar is from the the mean we assume it should have, and then divided by is home standard arrow, by the standard arrow of X bar, or the standard division of the sampling distribution.

487
01:02:53,000 --> 01:03:00,000
X bar, which is the same thing as that's over square was event bye on the part of the signal on the bottom is the noise.

488
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:07,000
So this is signal to noise ratio, if you want to call it by statistics, we call it this whole ratio.

489
01:03:07,000 --> 01:03:13,000
We call the P. statistics

490
01:03:13,000 --> 01:03:18,000
You just came from his name by the inventor name.

491
01:03:18,000 --> 01:03:23,000
It is a key statistic

492
01:03:23,000 --> 01:03:37,000
And large value of this ratio means larger evidence against the null that's all. and so forth there's a larger value of this T.

493
01:03:37,000 --> 01:03:41,000
By large I mean both positive or negative right, the magnitude of t being hard.

494
01:03:41,000 --> 01:03:48,000
That means more evidence against No. So we need to turn this key statistic into a pivot.

495
01:03:48,000 --> 01:03:53,000
Let's take a break for 10 min and then i'll continue on this.

496
01:03:53,000 --> 01:04:23,000
Thank you.

497
01:07:32,000 --> 01:07:38,000
Thank you, Gian, and ask question just to follow up on the my previous question.

498
01:07:38,000 --> 01:07:49,000
So basically, let's say we have 2 r cts they have like each 10,000 population. One the same question one is the p-value is like really, really small.

499
01:07:49,000 --> 01:08:05,000
The other one. But the signal is the same So does that make any difference, or as long as they're P. values, or what are significant, it doesn't matter like the significant the strength of evidence is the same for both.

500
01:08:05,000 --> 01:08:09,000
Yeah, yeah, I mean, if they have the same signal and one the same sample size.

501
01:08:09,000 --> 01:08:15,000
And why is the smaller key value? That means that one has a smaller variability. right?

502
01:08:15,000 --> 01:08:23,000
So that they are still different. but but in the end, because we use the p-value to make a decision right if we use a p-value to make a decision.

503
01:08:23,000 --> 01:08:30,000
In that case 0 point 0, 4, 9, or 0 point 0 0 one doesn't make a difference right?

504
01:08:30,000 --> 01:08:36,000
We make the same decision, because you hear that inside the communities that people when you're they're reviewing.

505
01:08:36,000 --> 01:08:41,000
The studies are like, Oh, this studies, like the p-value was Point 0 4, whereas that study was like, So they used that argument.

506
01:08:41,000 --> 01:08:46,000
It was interesting for me. it's the first time yeah yeah, there are many things involved.

507
01:08:46,000 --> 01:08:52,000
I mean that's a that's more involved the question the more I talk about actually could be more confusing.

508
01:08:52,000 --> 01:09:03,000
So I I have to be careful. right so a pivot 0 point 0 4 definitely give you a less confidence versus another one with 0 point 0 0 one. what's happening colleague.

509
01:09:03,000 --> 01:09:11,000
There's still both less than 0 point 0 5 so in terms of decision is the same right, for example, in terms of Fba.

510
01:09:11,000 --> 01:09:17,000
They both will approve the drop. Okay, so the same or not depend on what you're looking at.

511
01:09:17,000 --> 01:09:47,000
Okay, interesting. No, thank you, you're welcome

512
01:13:53,000 --> 01:14:03,000
Okay, that's continue with the lecture we have a few more slides, and to finish, then we'll start doing the exercise.

513
01:14:03,000 --> 01:14:09,000
So this is the the statistics we use to match the p-value.

514
01:14:09,000 --> 01:14:12,000
As I mentioned, the larger the t statistic, the stronger the evidence.

515
01:14:12,000 --> 01:14:19,000
So we need to turn this statistic. So this statistic can take a value from negative infinity to positive infinity. Right?

516
01:14:19,000 --> 01:14:24,000
The order of the magnitude on both sides measure the strong stronger the evidence.

517
01:14:24,000 --> 01:14:29,000
So we need to turn this into a key value which has a range from 0 to one.

518
01:14:29,000 --> 01:14:37,000
So do What do we do with that? We study the sounding distribution of this statistic

519
01:14:37,000 --> 01:14:51,000
It turns all that. the reason the very reason we do this it's because this statistic under the null hypothesis being true, if we assume that no have been true, then this does this statistic we'll follow a normal.

520
01:14:51,000 --> 01:14:56,000
distribution, the distribution. Because, you know, this statistic is defined based on the data.

521
01:14:56,000 --> 01:15:02,000
So itself is a random thing. therefore it has a similar distribution under the repeated something.

522
01:15:02,000 --> 01:15:08,000
It's framework. it will have a summary distribution It turns out up again, based on central limit theorem.

523
01:15:08,000 --> 01:15:15,000
The sample distribution. We have a normal distribution not only a normal distribution, but they're rather a normal 0.

524
01:15:15,000 --> 01:15:21,000
One standard normal distribution. we can call the Z this distribution.

525
01:15:21,000 --> 01:15:25,000
How can we call it? It is more involved than that. Technically, this statistic follows.

526
01:15:25,000 --> 01:15:29,000
Something called a key distribution That's Why it's about a piece statistic for the T.

527
01:15:29,000 --> 01:15:35,000
This distribution will look very much like normal will will convert to normal when the sample size is large.

528
01:15:35,000 --> 01:15:47,000
So for simplicity, let's just say this statistic will follow up stand on when the sample size is large, it doesn't really matter

529
01:15:47,000 --> 01:15:57,000
Okay, And then this is the normal 0 one distribution center at 0 standard deviation V: one. You see, the standard deviation is the distance between the shoulder to the center.

530
01:15:57,000 --> 01:16:02,000
Right one here.

531
01:16:02,000 --> 01:16:10,000
So what's happening is that assuming the know is true Then you collect the data you compute the statistic.

532
01:16:10,000 --> 01:16:25,000
This the thing can take but any value hi south but assuming that now it's true it should follow the normal distribution, which means that you are more likely to see vio between minus 2, and 2 you are very unlikely to see very

533
01:16:25,000 --> 01:16:30,000
large or very small values of the team. So if you see a key between 0 minus one and 2.

534
01:16:30,000 --> 01:16:36,000
You won't be surprised because you're expected to see that one and always true.

535
01:16:36,000 --> 01:16:45,000
But you see a t like minus 4 or plus 4 you'll be very much surprised because you you're not expected to see those values other than all.

536
01:16:45,000 --> 01:16:49,000
I apologize so that give you some hand. Maybe the null was not true.

537
01:16:49,000 --> 01:16:56,000
In the first place, right going back to the example right? You saw 9 out of 10 throws.

538
01:16:56,000 --> 01:17:02,000
You got a hat? Then you are started dialing. Whether the the coin was really fair.

539
01:17:02,000 --> 01:17:06,000
Same thing here.

540
01:17:06,000 --> 01:17:10,000
Okay, So we design a statistics so that you follow normal 0.

541
01:17:10,000 --> 01:17:13,000
One distribution under the knowledge of this. Now we can turn this into a P.

542
01:17:13,000 --> 01:17:21,000
Value. But if you suppose you, you measure a T. equals 2.5, you cannot directly compute the parallel.

543
01:17:21,000 --> 01:17:34,000
You see a 2.5 under the normal, because the normal is a continuous distribution, which means that the property that you'll see a specific value like 2.5 is always 0, right?

544
01:17:34,000 --> 01:17:40,000
Because they're even the number of are you can take so instead, we compute the probability of observing a P.

545
01:17:40,000 --> 01:17:48,000
Some value a key, or larger than he in magnitude. So if it was observed, a key cause 2.5.

546
01:17:48,000 --> 01:17:57,000
We compute the probability equal above 2.5, as well as equal, or below minus 2.5, we computer 2 tail go beyond key.

547
01:17:57,000 --> 01:18:03,000
So it's actually the P. by minus measure. the probability we will absorb key for more extreme values by more extreme value.

548
01:18:03,000 --> 01:18:15,000
We mean values go beyond key in both sides. Okay. So, for example, if t is 2, then the chance we see something below.

549
01:18:15,000 --> 01:18:20,000
T is 95%. the chance we see something go beyond keys.

550
01:18:20,000 --> 01:18:28,000
5%. right? So the number 2 is the boundary for us to declare.

551
01:18:28,000 --> 01:18:32,000
You know whether Q* is left on * or not?

552
01:18:32,000 --> 01:18:36,000
The pivotal simply measures the size of the tail.

553
01:18:36,000 --> 01:18:49,000
On both sides we have the P. we observe right. If the size of the 2 table is very small, then the pivot will be very small.

554
01:18:49,000 --> 01:18:54,000
Any questions so far

555
01:18:54,000 --> 01:18:58,000
So this is how we convert from the P. We compute it.

556
01:18:58,000 --> 01:19:01,000
The key. Statistically, we calculate from the data to A. P.

557
01:19:01,000 --> 01:19:05,000
V. we'll basically look at a standard normal curve look at where the P.

558
01:19:05,000 --> 01:19:13,000
Is i'm gonna measure the 2 tail the size of the 2 tail beyond the key on both both sides, and that is the P value.

559
01:19:13,000 --> 01:19:21,000
So a key of 2 or minus 2 correspond to a pivot of 0 point 0, 5 or 5% A.

560
01:19:21,000 --> 01:19:27,000
T large We correspond to P. by the left and point 5 0 point 0, 5, the T.

561
01:19:27,000 --> 01:19:32,000
Less than you know. B. 2 minus 1, 2. We have correspond to P value larger than 0 point 0 5.

562
01:19:32,000 --> 01:19:38,000
In that sense we don't even need to computer provider We can already know the concluded right just look at the key.

563
01:19:38,000 --> 01:19:44,000
We know whether we're gonna reject the novel no for the P.

564
01:19:44,000 --> 01:19:52,000
Value also apply to other cases. when we compute other statistic other than a piece of this, how about later on, like high school, or half or other things? right?

565
01:19:52,000 --> 01:19:56,000
So in the key case, we can actually look at the tea and know whether the P.

566
01:19:56,000 --> 01:19:59,000
Will be left on point or 5 or not but in other cases we cannot.

567
01:19:59,000 --> 01:20:09,000
So that's why we use the p value

568
01:20:09,000 --> 01:20:13,000
So let's plug in some real numbers to make it more realistic right.

569
01:20:13,000 --> 01:20:20,000
Suppose I will now have other is that new equals 4. So the 4 is the new up.

570
01:20:20,000 --> 01:20:29,000
And now suppose we clock data. I got the Polyphon as far as 6.7. Sx is 10 sample, that is 25.

571
01:20:29,000 --> 01:20:40,000
So you use the formula to compute the key statistic X bar minus mu naught, which is 6 point, 4, minus 4, divided by as X over square of events.

572
01:20:40,000 --> 01:20:46,000
So 10 over square root of 25 square root of 25 is 5, so 10 number 5 is cool.

573
01:20:46,000 --> 01:20:50,000
So the key statistic will be 6.7 minus 4 divided by 2.

574
01:20:50,000 --> 01:20:55,000
That's 1.3 5, just look at is 1.3 5.

575
01:20:55,000 --> 01:20:58,000
It is between minus 2 and 2, so we know the P.

576
01:20:58,000 --> 01:21:01,000
Value corresponding to it will not be last time. Point.

577
01:21:01,000 --> 01:21:17,000
Oh, fine. In fact, you know, you can have a really compute from this to this, because that require a lookup table or some sophisticated partner. Once the digital software, I can do it for you the turns out of a pivotal correspond to

578
01:21:17,000 --> 01:21:22,000
This particular key is 0 point, one name which is larger than *.

579
01:21:22,000 --> 01:21:33,000
As we would expect this point 0 point 1 8 is the size of the the 2 tails under the normal 0.

580
01:21:33,000 --> 01:21:42,000
One curve, young 0, 1 point, 3 5 and the minus 1.3, 5 for the 2 sides.

581
01:21:42,000 --> 01:22:08,000
So that's how we compute the viole That's how we make the testing technically this particular framework any questions so far

582
01:22:08,000 --> 01:22:16,000
So the key here is to understand what key value is for, and how do we use it right here?

583
01:22:16,000 --> 01:22:21,000
The example is this particular case. but later on we're gonna use pivot for other hypothesis.

584
01:22:21,000 --> 01:22:24,000
Other framework by the P. interpretation. The Pr.

585
01:22:24,000 --> 01:22:28,000
Is do the same for later on, because the data and the study design change.

586
01:22:28,000 --> 01:22:39,000
We've got a computer key values in different phone numbers

587
01:22:39,000 --> 01:22:48,000
Okay, there are 2 more slides that's now shift the gear a little bit.

588
01:22:48,000 --> 01:22:57,000
I'm talking about power and sample size another thing so we know there's type one arrow alpha and t 2 error rate data.

589
01:22:57,000 --> 01:23:04,000
We want to control type on error. that is, specify the level alpha.

590
01:23:04,000 --> 01:23:11,000
So how far usually is taken 0 point 0 one, and the way we control that is to look at Quebec.

591
01:23:11,000 --> 01:23:14,000
If pivot is left on Alpha, we reject them all.

592
01:23:14,000 --> 01:23:19,000
If the key value is larger than how far we we don't reject the know. and this way we will control the type on error rate.

593
01:23:19,000 --> 01:23:26,000
That's what we're going in the first place but this has nothing to do with type.

594
01:23:26,000 --> 01:23:31,000
2 errors. How do we reduce Part 2 error rate?

595
01:23:31,000 --> 01:23:37,000
It turns out that high 2 error rate is deep it's one minus the power.

596
01:23:37,000 --> 01:23:44,000
The typical power. so the smaller the type 2 error rate, the larger the power, or vice versa.

597
01:23:44,000 --> 01:23:47,000
The larger the power, the the lower the type, 2 error rate.

598
01:23:47,000 --> 01:23:53,000
So to reduce how to error rate, we need to increase the power and the power.

599
01:23:53,000 --> 01:24:03,000
What if the power, the power, is the probability of rejecting the all, when we should have rejected

600
01:24:03,000 --> 01:24:09,000
So the power is one minus data

601
01:24:09,000 --> 01:24:15,000
So how do we increase power? It turns out the power is the term.

602
01:24:15,000 --> 01:24:26,000
Invite a number of quality listed here. In this particular case there are full quality determines power, and this all this probably applied to.

603
01:24:26,000 --> 01:24:29,000
I have a different kind of study, where you just, you know, in different kind of study.

604
01:24:29,000 --> 01:24:38,000
Some of the quality did mean different things. so the first one the attorney. power is the type on error rate is alpha.

605
01:24:38,000 --> 01:24:43,000
As we mentioned i'll find the beta they go against each other through the alpha.

606
01:24:43,000 --> 01:24:57,000
You have to increase Beta. When you increase Beta, you actually reduce the power, which means that if you increase alpha and increase power, if you decrease Alpha, the deepest power.

607
01:24:57,000 --> 01:25:04,000
But we pretty much have no control of this because we Don't want to increase Alpha right, because Alpha is a pipeline arrow.

608
01:25:04,000 --> 01:25:13,000
Radio on the control. Usually it's taken at 0 point 0 5 So this thing, although they go like this, but we have no control.

609
01:25:13,000 --> 01:25:21,000
The second one determined power, like the sample size the larger the sample size and the higher the power.

610
01:25:21,000 --> 01:25:27,000
So that's good, which means that if you want to increase power. You can increase sample size, although it's not free. right.

611
01:25:27,000 --> 01:25:35,000
Increasing sample size usually require increase costs and budget and other things, and time time of the study, so it's not free.

612
01:25:35,000 --> 01:25:45,000
But nevertheless this one we have control. So the third wise of variability of the data, right?

613
01:25:45,000 --> 01:25:50,000
Basically the population variance of the quality you want to manage.

614
01:25:50,000 --> 01:25:55,000
So this one we have less controller because it's determined by the quantity we want to study. right.

615
01:25:55,000 --> 01:26:01,000
If you want to study block pressure that he has this intrinsic population variance, there's not much you can do with it.

616
01:26:01,000 --> 01:26:05,000
You can reduce your management error by using a more accurate instrument.

617
01:26:05,000 --> 01:26:20,000
That one we talk about, but that's only a small fraction of signal by the largest fraction of Sigma, although, or the individual variation, those who have no no control of you could possibly reduce Sigma by

618
01:26:20,000 --> 01:26:33,000
restricting the scope of this body. right? For example, if you include both the men and the women, are you include different age, different race, different gender and different location, you know. study. Probably the Sigma will be the largest of our venue

619
01:26:33,000 --> 01:26:36,000
is largely because you have a hydrogenous population.

620
01:26:36,000 --> 01:26:46,000
If you restrict on those, you only study a particular age group in a particular region in a particular gender and race, you will have a at a particular time.

621
01:26:46,000 --> 01:26:57,000
You have a last variability, but that may not be worth it, because not making your study very much restricted, not generalizable.

622
01:26:57,000 --> 01:27:01,000
So that go against you. So you do have some control over this.

623
01:27:01,000 --> 01:27:10,000
But at the cost of reducing the generalizability of your study, which may not be worth it. right.

624
01:27:10,000 --> 01:27:13,000
So all i'm trying to say is that there's no pretty much right to guess something.

625
01:27:13,000 --> 01:27:20,000
You have to pay some price in some way, and the final is the effect.

626
01:27:20,000 --> 01:27:30,000
Size which the difference between the null hip hop this, and the alternative in the sense that you might assume.

627
01:27:30,000 --> 01:27:35,000
For example, study a drug right you might assume the drug has some certain effect.

628
01:27:35,000 --> 01:27:45,000
I'll not have others that the drug has no effect then the difference between no effect and certain effect is your effect size here.

629
01:27:45,000 --> 01:27:52,000
The larger that you 5 the higher the power, which means that if the drug was more effective.

630
01:27:52,000 --> 01:28:12,000
In the first place, then, the higher power you will have which means that you shouldn't waste time on those drops which have minimally 5, because those drugs will require a very large sample size to prove they are you factor and even if they're in

631
01:28:12,000 --> 01:28:19,000
fact, it's so small may not be useful in practice right if I if I have a drug reduce your block measure by 10.

632
01:28:19,000 --> 01:28:31,000
No, that's good drop. Well, you have a drug reduce a pop broad pressure by one, although I can still prove it being, in fact, if using a very large sample size, but no one's gonna pay the drug so why bother.

633
01:28:31,000 --> 01:28:37,000
reduce ball packer by 1 one unit right so that's goes back to the previous.

634
01:28:37,000 --> 01:28:42,000
You know, slide, say statistical, significant is not the same as scientific.

635
01:28:42,000 --> 01:28:51,000
You could always establish the digital significance by increase sample size to almost infinity, basically over a power yourself.

636
01:28:51,000 --> 01:28:55,000
But then the fact has Maybe so. Miniscu is not used for you.

637
01:28:55,000 --> 01:29:02,000
Perfect. I saw the poisoning about all this quantities some of you have control.

638
01:29:02,000 --> 01:29:06,000
Some of you don't some of you have more control some of you have last.

639
01:29:06,000 --> 01:29:20,000
That's all. So close you have to think about it So the take on message is that when you're design a study you want to pick a problem and pick a design, especially pick it, pick the you know quantity want to measure and then pick a sample

640
01:29:20,000 --> 01:29:28,000
size, so that you have sufficient power. What is sufficient power?

641
01:29:28,000 --> 01:29:35,000
Remember we talk about type 2 error, right? We talk about type 2 error rate being 20% being small enough.

642
01:29:35,000 --> 01:29:41,000
Now, because power is one minus beta. So people think a power of 80% being good enough.

643
01:29:41,000 --> 01:29:49,000
So if you design a study, and you do the power calculation, you know, to calculate the power from this poor quantity require some sophisticated formula.

644
01:29:49,000 --> 01:29:55,000
Usually you would require standard edition with some sophisticated statistical software. I'm not going that to loud double detail.

645
01:29:55,000 --> 01:30:01,000
In simplest case you can table it by hand, but in most cases you need to write a program for user software.

646
01:30:01,000 --> 01:30:06,000
But nevertheless, suppose you compute the power of your study, depend on found comedy.

647
01:30:06,000 --> 01:30:10,000
You. you decide here. right? So, for example, you design a study to measure something from the literature.

648
01:30:10,000 --> 01:30:15,000
You have a guess about impact. you have a guess of the population of our ability.

649
01:30:15,000 --> 01:30:20,000
Now you put alpha is 0 point 0 one. I was set up.

650
01:30:20,000 --> 01:30:25,000
Target power to be 80%. And then, inversely, if I figure oh, I need the samples.

651
01:30:25,000 --> 01:30:39,000
I say, 150 people and then you'll put in a grand proposal, saying, I will collect 150 people or 200. If I you know expect some drawn house, and then based on all the assumption of a power of

652
01:30:39,000 --> 01:30:46,000
at least 80%. and that way the reviewer of your graph proposal will think about.

653
01:30:46,000 --> 01:30:50,000
You have a good power right by good, How are they mean?

654
01:30:50,000 --> 01:30:56,000
They give you money to perform your study, and with 80% of chance you might find something.

655
01:30:56,000 --> 01:31:05,000
So you're not wasting their money right if your power is too small, or you don't even do a power analysis letter reviewer.

656
01:31:05,000 --> 01:31:09,000
I think if your study has a very low power, why do we, with money? huh?

657
01:31:09,000 --> 01:31:19,000
On it right? because even if there is a real impact, you your study is not Paul, enough to find the impact, you're gonna fail with high probability.

658
01:31:19,000 --> 01:31:30,000
So we buy the don't waste money on this so power analysis is very useful for designing a study to put in a grant proposal, and things like those .

659
01:31:30,000 --> 01:31:34,000
Basically, before you carry out the analysis, carry out a study, you know.

660
01:31:34,000 --> 01:31:38,000
Think about what kind of power do you have that's what parallel analysis, you know.

661
01:31:38,000 --> 01:31:47,000
Come, see. So the power a guy with this full quantity they are interconnected.

662
01:31:47,000 --> 01:31:54,000
Changing one will usually require the change of the other right. For example, if we you have a target power, you can figure out universally.

663
01:31:54,000 --> 01:31:58,000
Pick out the samples as needed. Well, you have a sample size.

664
01:31:58,000 --> 01:32:03,000
You can figure out the power that you have requiring. You have knowledge of the the other 3.

665
01:32:03,000 --> 01:32:13,000
Point. Sometimes, you know, there's a chicken nack problem, because for for a new problem, you never work on, you don't really know the variability of the population or the effect time, right?

666
01:32:13,000 --> 01:32:16,000
Say you have a new drug. How do you know the that time? right?

667
01:32:16,000 --> 01:32:31,000
So you need to use your best gas, either from some pretty pre limited result, or from some literature, right from some similar drugs, or in in mouse studies and things like those right to make a big good guess about these quantities.

668
01:32:31,000 --> 01:32:39,000
Otherwise, you know, without all of this money you cannot do the power analysis

669
01:32:39,000 --> 01:32:43,000
So these are beyond the scope of this course. you know power analysis.

670
01:32:43,000 --> 01:32:48,000
Just show you that they are there, and you know you have study vision to help you out right.

671
01:32:48,000 --> 01:32:59,000
It's good that you know this association of all this quality involved, so that when you, when you speak to a statistician for the power analysis, but they will ask you about estimates of this right. Don't be surprised if they ask you

672
01:32:59,000 --> 01:33:06,000
and be prepared that you have some thoughts about what this number might be.

673
01:33:06,000 --> 01:33:36,000
Okay, that's awful. This lecture 6 any question before we move on to a project

674
01:33:41,000 --> 01:33:43,000
Yeah, I know some of you might take need some time to.

675
01:33:43,000 --> 01:33:52,000
Who absorb all of this right so yeah pick you up on, and then we'll have a project as well, and the quiz, and so on and so forth.

676
01:33:52,000 --> 01:33:56,000
We're gonna come back revisit some of this you know in future lectures.

677
01:33:56,000 --> 01:34:09,000
So yeah, let me know when Now you have a awesome So now let's move on to do the in-class Project sixp and and the lecture request both of them are due tomorrow morning.

678
01:34:09,000 --> 01:34:27,000
I'm gonna do it together. How was the the the project that's now open the project

679
01:34:27,000 --> 01:34:39,000
So we do 60. So 6 P. required to ask some questions, and is several, you know, parts, and some of them require the data on campus.

680
01:34:39,000 --> 01:34:48,000
I just follow it. one thing you need to use is this so called the one sample Keith has exhale rashy, and I will go over that right.

681
01:34:48,000 --> 01:34:58,000
So 6 B require you to use this 2 piece of data, and also a manuscript here, right?

682
01:34:58,000 --> 01:35:02,000
So take some time here. i'm done required to use this spreadsheet.

683
01:35:02,000 --> 01:35:11,000
I'll open it right now. Oh, by this time I hope you're usage of excel become much better.

684
01:35:11,000 --> 01:35:18,000
So what is she does is just like the one we show earlier about it.

685
01:35:18,000 --> 01:35:22,000
Does the 2 samples one sample key has for us Okay, we'll talk about other kind of test later on.

686
01:35:22,000 --> 01:35:29,000
But right now we focus on one simulator so We'll do it. I'll post your data past your data here.

687
01:35:29,000 --> 01:35:34,000
I've done This is the null no value the no mean is the mule.

688
01:35:34,000 --> 01:35:40,000
Now right, is the value you assume from your no i'll have holidays.

689
01:35:40,000 --> 01:35:45,000
You can change this number. Well, every other number don't touch it because those are capital formula data automatically.

690
01:35:45,000 --> 01:35:52,000
Alright, just pay your data here and change this number as needed, and everything else will be populated automatically.

691
01:35:52,000 --> 01:35:57,000
For example, this is the X bar sample mean, calculated from this sample as x.

692
01:35:57,000 --> 01:36:00,000
Some of standard deviation sample size is actually assembled.

693
01:36:00,000 --> 01:36:06,000
Even sample size is populated automatically once you're a field, email, no, no data here.

694
01:36:06,000 --> 01:36:10,000
And the standard arrow of the mean. And this is the T.

695
01:36:10,000 --> 01:36:15,000
Statistic. This is the corresponding key value, and also it give you lower and upper bound.

696
01:36:15,000 --> 01:36:21,000
Commonly. so i'll give you everything you should use this to do your population instead of use.

697
01:36:21,000 --> 01:36:24,000
The problem in your cell. You don't need a partner use hold the data here.

698
01:36:24,000 --> 01:36:30,000
I put it here so sometimes you don't really have the data right?

699
01:36:30,000 --> 01:36:33,000
You just have the me on the side of the dvd and sample size, and you don't have the data in those case.

700
01:36:33,000 --> 01:36:42,000
You can actually manually type in the number here just remember when you're typing the number.

701
01:36:42,000 --> 01:36:49,000
The formula will be destroyed Right? So when you type your number here and you pay the data later, the number will not change anymore.

702
01:36:49,000 --> 01:36:55,000
You need this star from scratch we'll make it the spreadsheet work again.

703
01:36:55,000 --> 01:37:15,000
Okay, Any questions, so far.

704
01:37:15,000 --> 01:37:23,000
Alright. So if there's no question I will have another breakout room for 25 min, try to keep the same formation from yesterday.

705
01:37:23,000 --> 01:37:27,000
But unfortunately, some of you doesn't have accounts for you to remember.

706
01:37:27,000 --> 01:37:57,000
So i'll run the meal sign and i'll send you there and see you in 25 min

707
01:38:24,000 --> 01:38:34,000
Talk to jail. Yes, Am I able to leave Zoom, and then come back to a different device?

708
01:38:34,000 --> 01:38:41,000
Yeah, cause I think i'm signed in on a different account on my on my ipad compared to my laptop.

709
01:38:41,000 --> 01:39:11,000
Yeah, no problem. Just come back, you know.

710
02:03:51,000 --> 02:03:58,000
Okay, that's i'll go over the exercise What about 10 min.

711
02:03:58,000 --> 02:04:06,000
I'm gonna take a break for another 10 min so number one.

712
02:04:06,000 --> 02:04:15,000
So this is about a study. Where give you real numbers of the sample.

713
02:04:15,000 --> 02:04:24,000
Very small sample size of 7 i'm gonna assume the population means 2.1.

714
02:04:24,000 --> 02:04:32,000
So group one, someone in group, one Can you tell us what to know? And the alternative apologies for this?

715
02:04:32,000 --> 02:04:39,000
So. H. Not Well, this is not

716
02:04:39,000 --> 02:04:55,000
I can do this one. So the null hypothesis is that families in Virginia have the same number of children on the average number of children in the United States, and the alternative hypothesis is that family is in virginia

717
02:04:55,000 --> 02:04:59,000
have more children than the average number of children in the Us.

718
02:04:59,000 --> 02:05:04,000
Okay, cool. thank you. So it's not it's mu equals 2 point.

719
02:05:04,000 --> 02:05:13,000
One and H. alternative. This meal greater than 2.1.

720
02:05:13,000 --> 02:05:18,000
So then let's pop another all these right so first of all we need to define new right. It should be meal.

721
02:05:18,000 --> 02:05:25,000
I type of you here. they always I mean number Oh, children.

722
02:05:25,000 --> 02:05:38,000
Or finally in Virginia. Right? So we assume under the now the mean number of children in Virginia is 2.1.

723
02:05:38,000 --> 02:05:46,000
The alternative usually is mu not equal I would say that's not equal to proof.

724
02:05:46,000 --> 02:05:51,000
So if you really assume new is greater than 2.1 a mu, less than 2.1.

725
02:05:51,000 --> 02:05:58,000
You can use those as alternative. Those are called the one-sided path which I do not spend a lot of time on.

726
02:05:58,000 --> 02:06:04,000
No, actually no time on this at all because there there's some tricky is to do with it.

727
02:06:04,000 --> 02:06:13,000
So what i'm saying is i'm also the time you may even you assume, or you believe the reality is only one side of the null.

728
02:06:13,000 --> 02:06:24,000
You could do 2 sides of the test, because that's more conservative, because, whatever your belief could be wrong right, if you conduct a one-sided test by turn out the data, show the other side.

729
02:06:24,000 --> 02:06:30,000
Then you are totally wrong. The whole study is involved so it's safer to just do a two-sided path like this.

730
02:06:30,000 --> 02:06:37,000
I've done, the hypothesis so there are rare cases where one sided has to make more sense.

731
02:06:37,000 --> 02:06:47,000
But I'm not going to you know go that you into this So any question

732
02:06:47,000 --> 02:06:56,000
Alright. so number 2 you know. use one sample key test.

733
02:06:56,000 --> 02:07:01,000
Excel to test, and all have always stated above. and stage of test.

734
02:07:01,000 --> 02:07:09,000
This is not keyboard interpretation, right? So we take these numbers, and when we take the the data here, right?

735
02:07:09,000 --> 02:07:13,000
So what you need to do is that you need to first clear out the data.

736
02:07:13,000 --> 02:07:27,000
I did everything. How are you how's it here and Then you basically the second one is 6, 2 1 2 more, 6 7, and the first 3 double check.

737
02:07:27,000 --> 02:07:36,000
Right now I have a mean standard deviation sample size 7 pass statistic

738
02:07:36,000 --> 02:07:53,000
Well, oh, I have actual 7 thank you i'm missing something like 3, 6, 2, 1 4.

739
02:07:53,000 --> 02:08:01,000
Oh, there's the sixth thank you no he's good Is it good?

740
02:08:01,000 --> 02:08:19,000
Did you guys have the same number? Yes, okay, cool. Well still not the same as one

741
02:08:19,000 --> 02:08:23,000
So this is a perfect null. So the mean, the standard deviation sample.

742
02:08:23,000 --> 02:08:25,000
Size is not an arrow and a P. statistical pivot.

743
02:08:25,000 --> 02:08:30,000
So you should get this number should be getting this, and then

744
02:08:30,000 --> 02:08:37,000
So I was saying a little bit right. So everything with Halloween cost is based on this T test and the ppas, will you?

745
02:08:37,000 --> 02:08:42,000
Good based on Saturday, and theorem and central material will be good with large sample size.

746
02:08:42,000 --> 02:08:47,000
By large I mean 20 of all. Some people say 50 of them, but that is plenty of all.

747
02:08:47,000 --> 02:08:57,000
Now we have 7. So when you have assembled as a 7, you have all sorts of problems. So first of all, you can not really track whether this is normal or not, right?

748
02:08:57,000 --> 02:09:05,000
With 7 data point. You cannot even make a piece of problem reasonable.

749
02:09:05,000 --> 02:09:09,000
Or basically i'm saying the public is normal it's just that your assumption it's not checkable.

750
02:09:09,000 --> 02:09:15,000
There are all sorts of this normality chat that normality past where they can pass the data to see whether it's normal or not.

751
02:09:15,000 --> 02:09:20,000
Honestly, all those tasks do not work with small sample because they just don't have power to reject.

752
02:09:20,000 --> 02:09:25,000
So, even if data is not normal, they cannot reject it.

753
02:09:25,000 --> 02:09:30,000
So now I just have to believe this. No second thing is that give you?

754
02:09:30,000 --> 02:09:36,000
You know, even if you believe that the population is normal, right?

755
02:09:36,000 --> 02:09:50,000
The formula. we're using class do not really work that well, because the summary distribution of the mean is is really normal, but only when you know the population standard deviation remember really the the sampling distribution of the sample

756
02:09:50,000 --> 02:09:59,000
mean has this has a side of the division of Sigma over square root of event. right? but that only works when you're no sigma by your radar. We don't know Sigma.

757
02:09:59,000 --> 02:10:03,000
So we use Sx to approximate but that approximation will be poor.

758
02:10:03,000 --> 02:10:10,000
He's a small sample. so people do all sorts of this correction. Use t statistics that's why I call the piston face right?

759
02:10:10,000 --> 02:10:18,000
So I don't want to go down much of a detail, But idea is that Wow!

760
02:10:18,000 --> 02:10:28,000
You know the problem that we give in cost, and all of those we talk about apply the large sample for a small sample, you know you use the physical software to do it, and they give you a more accurate key value Nevertheless, the more

761
02:10:28,000 --> 02:10:35,000
all those you know, technical details. Now we got a pivot 0 point 0 1 7.

762
02:10:35,000 --> 02:10:39,000
So my question is that what's your conclusion what's your conclusion of this P.

763
02:10:39,000 --> 02:10:46,000
Value of 0 point 0 1 7. So going back here right bye, I create this.

764
02:10:46,000 --> 02:10:51,000
Now so it's it's already here right so now we got a P.

765
02:10:51,000 --> 02:11:03,000
Equals equals 2 point, 3, 8, right, and the P value here equals 0 point 0, 1 7.

766
02:11:03,000 --> 02:11:07,000
So someone want to stay the conclusion. So maybe I forgot.

767
02:11:07,000 --> 02:11:15,000
Group 2 anybody in group 2 and tell us what's your conclusion

768
02:11:15,000 --> 02:11:23,000
Oh, sense of he it's we can reject the hope not. yeah.

769
02:11:23,000 --> 02:11:28,000
You could say, rejecting all that's happening correct you know too.

770
02:11:28,000 --> 02:11:36,000
So we interpret a little bit in the study right you can't say the data provide.

771
02:11:36,000 --> 02:11:42,000
I will say 0 point 0 7 is moderate evidence that goes back to the start.

772
02:11:42,000 --> 02:11:53,000
Right some people put, you know, 0 point 0, one below 0 point 0, 1, 2 star below 0 point 0, 0, 1 3 star.

773
02:11:53,000 --> 02:11:58,000
In that case this is a weak habitat right this is moderate is strong evidence, right?

774
02:11:58,000 --> 02:12:00,000
I mean it's it's more place, all arbitrary.

775
02:12:00,000 --> 02:12:07,000
Oh, you say, provide moderate evidence, or or it was a marginal or weak habit of whatever right, definitely, not strong evidence provide.

776
02:12:07,000 --> 02:12:16,000
You know I would say hmm

777
02:12:16,000 --> 02:12:36,000
Hello that the mean number children, or finally in Virginia is different from the national average.

778
02:12:36,000 --> 02:12:41,000
That's 2.1 right, so the complete interpretation of this right?

779
02:12:41,000 --> 02:12:49,000
The data provide some sort of a week. No, I will say yeah the week to moderate all of us.

780
02:12:49,000 --> 02:12:52,000
Oh, you don't have a red hat save some some level evidence right then. the mean number.

781
02:12:52,000 --> 02:12:56,000
Children profoundly. Virginia is different from the National.

782
02:12:56,000 --> 02:13:08,000
You could say it's greater because the mean here is greater I could say, it's greater, but because you test only the the the target on both sides degree different.

783
02:13:08,000 --> 02:13:11,000
So any questions here. So I'm saying yeah we rejected now.

784
02:13:11,000 --> 02:13:17,000
But putting in the contact. this is our conclusion right so you don't want to just say we reject the number in your paper.

785
02:13:17,000 --> 02:13:20,000
You want to interpret the conclusion put into the content Right?

786
02:13:20,000 --> 02:13:31,000
Any question here

787
02:13:31,000 --> 02:13:38,000
Alright. So finally, the 95% company in the vote he's here already right? 2.4 6 to 5.8. right?

788
02:13:38,000 --> 02:13:48,000
So that's the 95% common level for the population mean number 2 in in Virginia. Alright, i'll talk a little bit of here.

789
02:13:48,000 --> 02:13:54,000
You see this 95% common level from 2.5 to 5.8.

790
02:13:54,000 --> 02:14:05,000
This interval does not include 2 point, one so just from the interval we know 2 point: one is unlikely.

791
02:14:05,000 --> 02:14:10,000
I'm not corresponds to pivotal 0 point 0 1.

792
02:14:10,000 --> 02:14:14,000
You. in fact, the interval and the queue I know there sort of the equivalent.

793
02:14:14,000 --> 02:14:19,000
The pivotal will be less than point 0 0 0 point, 0 5.

794
02:14:19,000 --> 02:14:25,000
When the interval does not include this, this number, if you compute both of them, use the same sort of a sampling distribution. right?

795
02:14:25,000 --> 02:14:37,000
So if the null value is 0 point, 2, 4, 4, 6, then this on the boundary of this interval, then the key value is exactly 0 point 0 5.

796
02:14:37,000 --> 02:14:43,000
So that is to say, you know, although we use the pivot framework to make a call, we can simply look at the past.

797
02:14:43,000 --> 02:14:45,000
The statistic I mean, this case is 1.9, 6.

798
02:14:45,000 --> 02:14:48,000
Remember I talked about the 2. The 2 is just a rock number.

799
02:14:48,000 --> 02:14:57,000
The true number is 1.9 6 by anyway, i'm saying we could have run analysis, Use the statistic or even use the common level.

800
02:14:57,000 --> 02:15:02,000
We can just look at the common level. We can know the pivot will be left on point o 5 right now.

801
02:15:02,000 --> 02:15:06,000
2.1. The pivot will be last time. Oh, no fine.

802
02:15:06,000 --> 02:15:11,000
So all of these are mathematically equivalent to each other.

803
02:15:11,000 --> 02:15:15,000
We just do one versus the other because they have different utility.

804
02:15:15,000 --> 02:15:19,000
So you could say no. Commonly the is more complicated, right.

805
02:15:19,000 --> 02:15:23,000
Give it an interval very quantitative to give you a lot of information about what it'd be.

806
02:15:23,000 --> 02:15:26,000
The pivot itself is also quantitative, but just one number.

807
02:15:26,000 --> 02:15:32,000
This is 2 number right, is also pollinative, but in the end we just make a binary.

808
02:15:32,000 --> 02:15:38,000
That optimized conclusion. So we use different approach for different purposes.

809
02:15:38,000 --> 02:15:44,000
Oh, they are not matter! repound together. Let me know you have any questions.

810
02:15:44,000 --> 02:16:14,000
I move on alright, let's take a break what time of this, and then continue with the rest

811
02:26:37,000 --> 02:26:48,000
Okay, let's stop continue with the second question which is about these Article I'm in in the table one.

812
02:26:48,000 --> 02:27:00,000
So let's what kind of article here

813
02:27:00,000 --> 02:27:12,000
And then table one right here. So the question was, What is the 95% common number for me and age of recently in parts of the mother?

814
02:27:12,000 --> 02:27:17,000
Right follow up, based on your answer. Kind of include that recently. call the mother less than 30 years old.

815
02:27:17,000 --> 02:27:26,000
Don't have it right now. so i'm Sorry right here so we do need to look at it, hey?

816
02:27:26,000 --> 02:27:56,000
So this numbers So with someone in group 3 maybe want to answer this

817
02:28:14,000 --> 02:28:21,000
Anyone from group, 3 or from the whole cost oh, wow!

818
02:28:21,000 --> 02:28:34,000
I can answer this question. So for the mean, the sample mean you have 25 point, 2, 1, one, and then for your standard deviation at 6.0 5.

819
02:28:34,000 --> 02:28:47,000
One so based off of that we can do the confidence interval and plug those in into our equation, and you get 25.0, 2, and then 25.4, 0.

820
02:28:47,000 --> 02:28:54,000
And based on this answer, I could conclude that Yes, because of the confidence in your value value is less than 30 awesome.

821
02:28:54,000 --> 02:28:59,000
Thank you so much. So just one quick question. right can be the common level. You also need a sample size.

822
02:28:59,000 --> 02:29:06,000
So what samples are that you use here? for the sample size I use 4,096.

823
02:29:06,000 --> 02:29:10,000
I got it from the methods awesome. Thank you so much.

824
02:29:10,000 --> 02:29:16,000
Exactly. Yeah, you can find the sample size. Yeah, just this is question to ask you to look for the you know.

825
02:29:16,000 --> 02:29:23,000
Necessary necessary information from the article. you need to figure out the sample size, which is 4,096.

826
02:29:23,000 --> 02:29:34,000
Once you have that you have the mean have the standard deviation you plug in the scratchy that'll give you the company involved. and then the comprehensive does not include the reference value actually far away.

827
02:29:34,000 --> 02:29:47,000
Therefore can conclude that this now is it's not correct Annie comments Anybody talk different answers.

828
02:29:47,000 --> 02:29:53,000
So we got the same answer, but had a quick question on the on the excel sheet.

829
02:29:53,000 --> 02:29:57,000
If you change the no mean right, because the no meeting there was

830
02:29:57,000 --> 02:30:05,000
This will be 25 point, 2, one And then the the no mean we. I change that to 30 right?

831
02:30:05,000 --> 02:30:11,000
Not an aviation 6.0, 5 sample size was 4 0, 9, 6.

832
02:30:11,000 --> 02:30:16,000
Right, so I get the same numbers. But what I realized was that initially, when I did it I didn't change the all mean.

833
02:30:16,000 --> 02:30:24,000
It was 3 or something on the previous question, and and the effect there was that to change the t statistic number.

834
02:30:24,000 --> 02:30:30,000
Yup: right? Yeah. from being like a negative 50 to a, you know.

835
02:30:30,000 --> 02:30:35,000
200 Number: Yeah, Yeah. you're right you know you look at the formula.

836
02:30:35,000 --> 02:30:45,000
It's statistic depend on no mean and The P. value also depend on this. The pivotal didn't change because all the both sides key value is super small, so it doesn't change the

837
02:30:45,000 --> 02:30:53,000
comedy. the book, doesn't depend on me so like thank you for pointing out

838
02:30:53,000 --> 02:31:02,000
Any other comments

839
02:31:02,000 --> 02:31:18,000
Okay, So the next one is what's the 95% confidence interval for the mean number children recently part of the mother, and whether you know that's the different from the average of national average of 3 group, 4

840
02:31:18,000 --> 02:31:40,000
maybe

841
02:31:40,000 --> 02:31:47,000
Analysis are kind of repetitive. so we can go a little faster if you want. so let's let's do it together.

842
02:31:47,000 --> 02:32:02,000
Maybe This is the main number of children which is where was it?

843
02:32:02,000 --> 02:32:12,000
Or not for dollar. He was number of children right? 2.3 0, 7, 2 point, 3 oh, 7, 1 point, 3, 3 0, right?

844
02:32:12,000 --> 02:32:17,000
That sounds the same. So once you plug in this numbers i'm not going to do it.

845
02:32:17,000 --> 02:32:25,000
But then you will be getting a interval which does not include 3, 2, point, 2, 7 to 2.

846
02:32:25,000 --> 02:32:34,000
Point 3, 5, cool. Yeah, thank you. Yeah, 2.2 7. to 2.3, 5, so that doesn't include 3.

847
02:32:34,000 --> 02:32:38,000
Therefore the conclusion is the same pipe. this is a different distribution.

848
02:32:38,000 --> 02:32:47,000
Right. Saw that different from on that statement. Yeah.

849
02:32:47,000 --> 02:33:00,000
So when you look at see, and we see 4 number of children, I just saw this: that 6.7% is missing.

850
02:33:00,000 --> 02:33:07,000
So would that change our sample? Size? Very good point.

851
02:33:07,000 --> 02:33:13,000
Yes, in principle, you should reduce your sample size right yeah it's more involved than that.

852
02:33:13,000 --> 02:33:22,000
You know, here we are definitely ignoring any missing data, cause we are not teaching how to deal with missing data, right? But the simplest case you have to run right.

853
02:33:22,000 --> 02:33:27,000
If you have 6, 7 point, 7% missing data on the sample size of mark is last.

854
02:33:27,000 --> 02:33:30,000
Now, what is stated in the crack for that get a smaller sample side.

855
02:33:30,000 --> 02:33:36,000
There forget the slightly. Why, they're compelling about but probably in this case doesn't change things qualitatively right.

856
02:33:36,000 --> 02:33:40,000
You're absolutely right in reality dealing with missing data is more involved than this.

857
02:33:40,000 --> 02:33:51,000
There's actually a you know the whole disappointment I mean at least a book or a textbook or a horse deal with missing data, because you they're they're usually involved in that I I don't wanna go deep

858
02:33:51,000 --> 02:33:54,000
into that. But I I appreciate you pointing out and you're right.

859
02:33:54,000 --> 02:33:57,000
It'll be better to to account for this you know sample size.

860
02:33:57,000 --> 02:34:06,000
Thank you so much. Oh, that that's not a point here you know we're trying so we're we're now ignoring this, which is not ideal.

861
02:34:06,000 --> 02:34:14,000
Well, nevertheless. not not too bad, though yeah the reason I won't change much.

862
02:34:14,000 --> 02:34:20,000
Any other questions.

863
02:34:20,000 --> 02:34:23,000
Could you? I can calculate the confidence in intervals.

864
02:34:23,000 --> 02:34:30,000
Could you repeat again for both the amb the conclusions that we can draw?

865
02:34:30,000 --> 02:34:36,000
You want me to calculate the combinable or or draw the conclusion? No, I got the confidence interval. I can calculate that.

866
02:34:36,000 --> 02:34:39,000
But as far as inclusion can you just repeat it?

867
02:34:39,000 --> 02:34:44,000
Sorry I could. I just

868
02:34:44,000 --> 02:34:51,000
Right So we and that's a conventional for the population meeting right?

869
02:34:51,000 --> 02:34:59,000
So the conclusion is that you know this gives us how it is.

870
02:34:59,000 --> 02:35:15,000
Dot com reach, you know, children in this population, right where you kind of spell the whole public.

871
02:35:15,000 --> 02:35:20,000
It is right, not 3. right? So basically, you assume, is 3.

872
02:35:20,000 --> 02:35:24,000
But 3 is all at this interval So it's on far on like it is 3, Right?

873
02:35:24,000 --> 02:35:41,000
Okay? And then for the for a hey? same thing right so it doesn't include the 30 is not included in our confidence in a yeah, it's like 25.0 3 to 25. point 4 So because it's I include the interval I mean it doesn't

874
02:35:41,000 --> 02:35:50,000
include the age that we're talking about on our not the average.

875
02:35:50,000 --> 02:36:00,000
It's 35, page of this population just sorry bye So that that's exactly what you can say.

876
02:36:00,000 --> 02:36:05,000
So you you never know, for sure because it's random and you know the true average.

877
02:36:05,000 --> 02:36:15,000
You don't see? and this interval is random you never know for sure why you have confidence that saying something versus them the opposite. Yeah.

878
02:36:15,000 --> 02:36:22,000
So there are many way of stating it just don't say the probability, it is true, is 95% or something like that.

879
02:36:22,000 --> 02:36:32,000
Those will be incorrect. Okay. And then this thing same thing.

880
02:36:32,000 --> 02:36:37,000
I think we just use the different call. If you do the math, I mean, I would just go ahead do it.

881
02:36:37,000 --> 02:36:40,000
I think you're accommodating the low will be 3.2, 5.

882
02:36:40,000 --> 02:36:45,000
I don't want to waste too much time here 3 to 2, 4, and the right value is 5.

883
02:36:45,000 --> 02:36:54,000
Right. So again, which give us, you know nicely, the average is not 5. right?

884
02:36:54,000 --> 02:36:58,000
So the conclusion that the average of these populations are fine. right?

885
02:36:58,000 --> 02:37:01,000
So same thing. but essentially you you just find the right variable.

886
02:37:01,000 --> 02:37:04,000
It will compute a common interval and then it doesn't improve 5.

887
02:37:04,000 --> 02:37:11,000
So you you reject them all

888
02:37:11,000 --> 02:37:14,000
Right. You also call the key value as well all of this.

889
02:37:14,000 --> 02:37:19,000
Right. So same thing.

890
02:37:19,000 --> 02:37:26,000
Any questions so far

891
02:37:26,000 --> 02:37:47,000
Alright, So that's now question 4 of 2 d right? So that in the C. we basically the study provide evidence that the children of the incarcerated mother do not have quality relation.

892
02:37:47,000 --> 02:37:53,000
Because you know their average last time what it needed for a quality regime.

893
02:37:53,000 --> 02:38:08,000
So you can say evidence for not having all of your relationship okay, so then we're cool.

894
02:38:08,000 --> 02:38:14,000
Think about This is the incarcerated woman, and their children do not have quality right?

895
02:38:14,000 --> 02:38:20,000
So the question is that can we say that any quality impact of a mother being incarcerated?

896
02:38:20,000 --> 02:38:35,000
All the religion of child was the father. So anyone from, I forgot is group 4 or 5, or anyway, in the cost

897
02:38:35,000 --> 02:38:47,000
I don't think you can determine causal effects. You can determine associations, but you cannot determine cause it's a retrospective study, so I mean you clearly have a co-founder with a number

898
02:38:47,000 --> 02:38:50,000
of the father characteristics that you can see lower in the table.

899
02:38:50,000 --> 02:38:59,000
Particularly like there are 31 point, 3% of fathers who are also incarcerated, so that will change your

900
02:38:59,000 --> 02:39:04,000
Your average pretty significantly, if they're not able to see their children at all.

901
02:39:04,000 --> 02:39:14,000
So absolutely. Yeah, I mean this is again observational study but it's very hard to say anything calls on there.

902
02:39:14,000 --> 02:39:21,000
If if not any So in principle, confounding could be a serious issue.

903
02:39:21,000 --> 02:39:29,000
Right, I think about all different compounding. oh, confounding basic basic of factors which are both associated with the exposure and outcome here.

904
02:39:29,000 --> 02:39:35,000
Right. So family structure all sorts of things

905
02:39:35,000 --> 02:39:41,000
Any other commas

906
02:39:41,000 --> 02:39:44,000
So again, you know we have to be careful with the language.

907
02:39:44,000 --> 02:39:47,000
Feel right. We cannot conclude, concluded Causal.

908
02:39:47,000 --> 02:39:52,000
You packed here, but that's not the same as saying there is no causal impact here.

909
02:39:52,000 --> 02:39:59,000
We just don't have evidence for calling it could be that there is a causal impact. but this data do not support.

910
02:39:59,000 --> 02:40:05,000
Do not show that right, because there's observational data right? But the quality of fact may also be there.

911
02:40:05,000 --> 02:40:12,000
So we do not rule up, but we cannot include either

912
02:40:12,000 --> 02:40:23,000
So you know, sometimes the new thing a lot of have the news saying, Yeah, there's no out of this that particular vaccine has a strong side effect.

913
02:40:23,000 --> 02:40:34,000
So you have to take that into. So you compete. You cannot determine side effects from the vaccine, from the data, but you also cannot rule it out. Right?

914
02:40:34,000 --> 02:40:42,000
So this same thing there. So when people say there's no evidence showing some side impact that doesn't mean there's no side effect bye.

915
02:40:42,000 --> 02:40:45,000
So be careful of the wording it's it's kind of tricky a lot of hans you know.

916
02:40:45,000 --> 02:40:53,000
I think there's definitely a loss in translation going from a scientific literature to the news report right and to the late person.

917
02:40:53,000 --> 02:41:05,000
So there's a loss in translation there. so be careful. And then, you know, if possible, try to educate people around you who are not so familiar with the terminology here. right?

918
02:41:05,000 --> 02:41:17,000
Any comments.

919
02:41:17,000 --> 02:41:22,000
Okay, So finally, we we gotta do the exercise with the 500 city prevalence data.

920
02:41:22,000 --> 02:41:37,000
You work on that, You know, you know, health agency determining how the best allocated resource agency would like to focus effort on public health area that expect the negative impact at least 25%, of evidence right Now, look at the data final

921
02:41:37,000 --> 02:41:51,000
identify 2. So let's hope on the 500 CD data

922
02:41:51,000 --> 02:42:02,000
Which is here. So the key is to identify 2 public house issues, which, in which of fact, at least 25% of population.

923
02:42:02,000 --> 02:42:09,000
This tail is he's on different city right so you want to look at the columns which are fact more than 25%.

924
02:42:09,000 --> 02:42:14,000
Your most of the series. So anyone want to identify one of them.

925
02:42:14,000 --> 02:42:22,000
At least

926
02:42:22,000 --> 02:42:28,000
It looks like arthritis affects a lot of people all the the numbers.

927
02:42:28,000 --> 02:42:31,000
Yeah, I'm also. yeah, I mean most of the number I don't know.

928
02:42:31,000 --> 02:42:34,000
Most of the number here are left on 25% right.

929
02:42:34,000 --> 02:42:43,000
They affect a lot of people about less than 25%, authorizing right also for for cancer and for drinking.

930
02:42:43,000 --> 02:43:00,000
Right. They attack a lot of people. But yeah, less than 25% of population. high blood pressure is an option, especially because if you correlate it with blood pressure medicine, taking like you can see like, more than 25

931
02:43:00,000 --> 02:43:07,000
percent of population tends to get into that category trying to see which column it is.

932
02:43:07,000 --> 02:43:15,000
Thank you. Alright, Hi: W: Okay, Thank you. Hard to find. Yeah. high block pressure.

933
02:43:15,000 --> 02:43:20,000
In fact, Yeah, i'll say just eyeballing you're mostly studio.

934
02:43:20,000 --> 02:43:25,000
Fact, more than 25% right it's it's 2726 for many cities.

935
02:43:25,000 --> 02:43:37,000
Yeah, that's a and this one high class for that funny right anything else

936
02:43:37,000 --> 02:43:46,000
Mmography. Why, looks like it. should yeah my mammography is the for some people would did it?

937
02:43:46,000 --> 02:43:57,000
Well, I I don't know I mean do people actually do it in their annual checkout for both of older women, or they only do it when they have a sign of you know the need of doing it.

938
02:43:57,000 --> 02:44:02,000
Oh, it's a screening test it's a screen Okay, Yeah, I mean, this is not a bad thing.

939
02:44:02,000 --> 02:44:10,000
Right people. More people do it about I mean i'm out for I mean there's some radiation there, but that is this is not a issue of facting.

940
02:44:10,000 --> 02:44:18,000
People. Oh, Bcv: I guess Yeah, I don't know look like around 25%.

941
02:44:18,000 --> 02:44:24,000
Well, that's true. the high cost row for sure Yeah, hypothesis for sure.

942
02:44:24,000 --> 02:44:37,000
High blood, pressure, high profile, anything else.

943
02:44:37,000 --> 02:44:40,000
I don't know about this Leave if this is a sleep problem.

944
02:44:40,000 --> 02:44:47,000
Then it's more than 25% harlem aye let's take a look.

945
02:44:47,000 --> 02:44:51,000
Sleep last night 7 h a day. right? So that seems to be a problem of fact.

946
02:44:51,000 --> 02:44:56,000
More than 25% of people actually what i'm one of them.

947
02:44:56,000 --> 02:45:04,000
So who's getting 7 h asleep I'm: Jealous.

948
02:45:04,000 --> 02:45:09,000
Yeah.

949
02:45:09,000 --> 02:45:16,000
Okay, anything else? Yeah. taking vp medication this is a block pressure medication.

950
02:45:16,000 --> 02:45:21,000
I don't know what medication did so that's definitely a lot of people right? Yeah.

951
02:45:21,000 --> 02:45:31,000
Block pressure control. Oh, i'm I see yeah that's that's in adults with high blood pressure.

952
02:45:31,000 --> 02:45:34,000
So that's not a bad thing. People are taking medication so this do not.

953
02:45:34,000 --> 02:45:52,000
This is not a present in the overall population Okay, yeah I think that's about it.

954
02:45:52,000 --> 02:45:56,000
Yeah, awesome. it's almost 25%.

955
02:45:56,000 --> 02:46:03,000
How was it between 20 and 25 Why, is it that you don't want to pick the values that are lower than 25?

956
02:46:03,000 --> 02:46:13,000
Technically you could. Is that correct? Yeah. if this is just a question asking, you know, negative impact, 25%, how you could, you could look at, say, for example, many, many many issues.

957
02:46:13,000 --> 02:46:19,000
There. they are impacting a lot of people right you know it's just a question to ask about it right.

958
02:46:19,000 --> 02:46:22,000
But you know, Kansas are, for example, packing about 5 to 10% people.

959
02:46:22,000 --> 02:46:31,000
Right. So it's also a series usually just not answering the question being asked, There's nothing specific about the question.

960
02:46:31,000 --> 02:46:47,000
Okay, it's just an exercise, But also read the data Okay, any question

961
02:46:47,000 --> 02:46:56,000
Okay.

962
02:46:56,000 --> 02:47:03,000
If not, let's so I I have a few questions for you than

963
02:47:03,000 --> 02:47:09,000
So I I got some feedback right about this breakout room.

964
02:47:09,000 --> 02:47:13,000
So there there is a history to do it right. The first thing I I teach this course.

965
02:47:13,000 --> 02:47:17,000
3 years ago, 4 years ago, he was in person setting.

966
02:47:17,000 --> 02:47:20,000
So the the groups signing works pretty pretty good.

967
02:47:20,000 --> 02:47:30,000
But since the second year is start, you know, shifting into virtue, and, as you know, the breakout room in zoom just do not work as good as in person. Right?

968
02:47:30,000 --> 02:47:41,000
So I I think it's good to still have group projects, because you got, I think, the important thing of this course is, I got to know people in the past right establish personal leadership I also feel like there's a group supporting

969
02:47:41,000 --> 02:47:45,000
you and also you're gonna learn from each other right so it's good.

970
02:47:45,000 --> 02:47:51,000
But but you know this brief House session definitely do not work as good as in person, and I I also told it.

971
02:47:51,000 --> 02:47:58,000
I understand some people prefer to work by themselves. Right? So the second year I do this breakout room randomly every day.

972
02:47:58,000 --> 02:48:05,000
So every day you randomly assign with other people. But some, you know, some feedback I got is that they want to stick with the same group, at least for a week.

973
02:48:05,000 --> 02:48:12,000
So they know the people that I got it so this year i'm doing this. this, you know, every week I run them.

974
02:48:12,000 --> 02:48:15,000
But still Zoom has some problem of remembering your allocation.

975
02:48:15,000 --> 02:48:19,000
Some of you just logging with different accounts. That room cannot remember.

976
02:48:19,000 --> 02:48:26,000
So some people got the same group somewhere we don't and also I understand some people do now want the working group, so so I do not force you into group.

977
02:48:26,000 --> 02:48:33,000
I rather allow you to open group yourself. You want to stay in the main lobby main classroom.

978
02:48:33,000 --> 02:48:39,000
It's off to you right but I understand some people are got assigned with a with a group.

979
02:48:39,000 --> 02:48:41,000
People who do not want to work in groups which is unfortunate.

980
02:48:41,000 --> 02:48:46,000
Right. So now you know, I can do a survey, And who wants to be with phone?

981
02:48:46,000 --> 02:48:56,000
And it just not fees about in this setting how to do the survey, and also because Zoom does not remember allocation, I have to manually assign everything which is too much time. right.

982
02:48:56,000 --> 02:49:00,000
So my 2 options are. One is to keep doing what we are doing.

983
02:49:00,000 --> 02:49:04,000
Every week we reassign client 2. The other thing is that going back to last year?

984
02:49:04,000 --> 02:49:14,000
I I randomized every day. And then for those of you who do not want to take the group, you can just stay in the main line.

985
02:49:14,000 --> 02:49:20,000
Yeah, I mean, people say you know Zoom cannot remember you unless you have some sort of a you account.

986
02:49:20,000 --> 02:49:24,000
I guess that might be the case, but it's beyond me who can control this right?

987
02:49:24,000 --> 02:49:27,000
I try my best. but zoom doesn't allow it so among the 2 options, right?

988
02:49:27,000 --> 02:49:33,000
Do you prefer the current way, or do you prefer to randomize every day?

989
02:49:33,000 --> 02:49:41,000
I think the problem probably lies within the Fact that people that don't necessarily want to work in groups.

990
02:49:41,000 --> 02:49:50,000
Are going into the breakout rooms so maybe they should just stay in the lobby, or we can enforce that, cause that I've gone into groups a few times.

991
02:49:50,000 --> 02:49:58,000
And i'll just put myself out there like people are not. It doesn't seem like they want to be in working in groups, which I think is fine.

992
02:49:58,000 --> 02:50:05,000
But I then have to work alone, and I would love to work with other people.

993
02:50:05,000 --> 02:50:09,000
So. I don't know what the solution to that would be is but

994
02:50:09,000 --> 02:50:34,000
I feel like maybe those that don't really care to work with other people should just stay and not join these rooms

995
02:50:34,000 --> 02:50:40,000
You could actually jump to another group in principle. If you feel like you know, you wanna go to another group.

996
02:50:40,000 --> 02:50:46,000
I I think, feel free. So what I will do is seems like I will continue with what i'm doing right now.

997
02:50:46,000 --> 02:50:57,000
But people, if you don't want to work in group feel free to stay in the main room, and then people if you are allowing a group feel free to jump the cost rules, and then That's Monday I will reassign groups and for

998
02:50:57,000 --> 02:51:06,000
the next week. Does that sounds hold by something reasonable I don't know. I mean i'm trying my best I see.

999
02:51:06,000 --> 02:51:12,000
Okay, Okay, thank you. So much for your time. I really appreciate preferring I do this in person.

1000
02:51:12,000 --> 02:51:17,000
But you know, we have to deal with what we can.

1001
02:51:17,000 --> 02:51:25,000
Alright. thank you so much alright, so thanks for watching.

1002
02:51:25,000 --> 02:51:30,000
So for the for the rest of time today. we're gonna do a little bit of 6 8.

1003
02:51:30,000 --> 02:51:41,000
But honestly, it's becoming kind of boring dealing with numbers. So we're gonna do it together and quickly, and we may not do everything just want to each of you to get enough exercise.

1004
02:51:41,000 --> 02:51:50,000
And then we move on to the next lecture. Okay, and you you only need to submit sixp and do the quiz proposal to do tomorrow. So 6, 8, you know.

1005
02:51:50,000 --> 02:51:56,000
You don't have this on there that's open 6 a you can do alongside, you know, by yourself.

1006
02:51:56,000 --> 02:52:08,000
You want as well. it's just some exercise okay

1007
02:52:08,000 --> 02:52:13,000
So 6, 8, a healthy birthday for babies, for in the Us.

1008
02:52:13,000 --> 02:52:23,000
Is currently set up 2,800 grams, the average birthday for babies born to woman living in poverty web, seen this electrodes by lower than 28.

1009
02:52:23,000 --> 02:52:31,000
Recently a local hospital introduced a innovate, innovative new prenatal care program to reduce the number.

1010
02:52:31,000 --> 02:52:39,000
Low birthday baby, especially for Colin. right? So for this problem interest.

1011
02:52:39,000 --> 02:52:46,000
What is the population? Oh, infant! Anyone want to say something?

1012
02:52:46,000 --> 02:52:50,000
Woman in poverty. It is woman in poverty.

1013
02:52:50,000 --> 02:53:02,000
But I would really say the babies right from women living in Portland from mother loving in poverty. Yeah, thank you.

1014
02:53:02,000 --> 02:53:16,000
I think that's more more specific and welcome pop in a parameter of interest, I think birthday yup.

1015
02:53:16,000 --> 02:53:24,000
So Parameter is about a population of here is really the mean birthday in this population. right?

1016
02:53:24,000 --> 02:53:28,000
So we're not going to run the path for the know how holidays?

1017
02:53:28,000 --> 02:53:45,000
What's the know him hardness, in this particular case the mean birth weight would be 2,800 grams. Now let's say this is the mule or new or you Then the that's u equals 2,800 rack

1018
02:53:45,000 --> 02:53:51,000
rob, and then the alternative is time you not equal. I cannot hide, but not repo.

1019
02:53:51,000 --> 02:53:57,000
So I use this not equal alright. so this is pretty single that's pretty far.

1020
02:53:57,000 --> 02:54:02,000
Any question.

1021
02:54:02,000 --> 02:54:18,000
Now let's move on. So pose one to study you know Question post in one right now with a study right? Suppose we do a single random sample of 25 mothers moving and poverty right and the week, on their hospital

1022
02:54:18,000 --> 02:54:25,000
records and their babies and their birthways right? And we actually got the mean birthday.

1023
02:54:25,000 --> 02:54:29,000
The 3 3,083 grams with a standard deviation 6 Oa!

1024
02:54:29,000 --> 02:54:35,000
So what's the value of the p statistics right How do we come to the piece of physic now?

1025
02:54:35,000 --> 02:54:50,000
We require you to remember. the pharmaceutical has a polynomial right, which is, you know, the mean X bar, which is 383, right minus the reference value of the mean under the null which is

1026
02:54:50,000 --> 02:54:54,000
2,800, divided by the you know the started Dvd.

1027
02:54:54,000 --> 02:54:59,000
And 608, divided by square root of sample size 25. right?

1028
02:54:59,000 --> 02:55:03,000
So the denominator is the ratio so it's something divided by something divided by something.

1029
02:55:03,000 --> 02:55:10,000
So you have to use the parameters along. so you have to do the do the calculation.

1030
02:55:10,000 --> 02:55:14,000
But what's cool about it is that you can just take this i'm in.

1031
02:55:14,000 --> 02:55:21,000
I believe you know you don't even need a capital go to your browser?

1032
02:55:21,000 --> 02:55:26,000
How about you? You give you the 2.3, 3 nowadays.

1033
02:55:26,000 --> 02:55:32,000
It just. you know things are so convenient. So that was 2 point, 3 3.

1034
02:55:32,000 --> 02:55:39,000
So my question is what's the interpretation of this statistic

1035
02:55:39,000 --> 02:55:45,000
Cool, obviously, that he's statistics point 2.3 3 What does that tell you?

1036
02:55:45,000 --> 02:55:57,000
Is that the p-value is going to be less than *, Because this is an outlier to negative 2 to 2.

1037
02:55:57,000 --> 02:56:01,000
Thank you. Yeah, the t is greater than 2, which means, the P.

1038
02:56:01,000 --> 02:56:07,000
Is gonna be last 1.0 5 right we gotta reject the now, let's see whether that's the case right?

1039
02:56:07,000 --> 02:56:10,000
So we could use the spreadsheet to do it.

1040
02:56:10,000 --> 02:56:14,000
You just put in the numbers. i'm not gonna do it for saving pie. But the P.

1041
02:56:14,000 --> 02:56:20,000
Turns out that would be 0 point 0 2. So we got what we expected. Another conclusion.

1042
02:56:20,000 --> 02:56:27,000
I would be a party, reject the null. but you know to be more specific, right?

1043
02:56:27,000 --> 02:56:32,000
So there is evidence you could say week to moderate right.

1044
02:56:32,000 --> 02:56:40,000
How does that the average No, there is no there's not no evidence right?

1045
02:56:40,000 --> 02:56:50,000
There's not enough how it does not the average sorry is not 2,800.

1046
02:56:50,000 --> 02:56:56,000
So we failed to reject them. now. Okay, Sorry I have a quick question.

1047
02:56:56,000 --> 02:57:09,000
For when we're discussing the null hypothesis and the alternative hypothesis to me, I feel like it should be a little bit more specific where we're saying that the each alternative

1048
02:57:09,000 --> 02:57:20,000
is that your mean birthweight you're expecting to be less than 2,800 grams as opposed to your null hypothesis being that is equal to, or greater than not just that it's equal or not

1049
02:57:20,000 --> 02:57:33,000
equal, and maybe i'm overthinking that but like it's just that'll give us that'll just change what our overall assessment is, and down the line is like these questions Thanks for the question I gotta address this I mean

1050
02:57:33,000 --> 02:57:36,000
I talk a little bit, but not about them. So right now we are using this.

1051
02:57:36,000 --> 02:57:46,000
This is called 2 sided tornado, for this test is called 2.

1052
02:57:46,000 --> 02:57:50,000
Find it path. Well, some people are the 2 tail of the past.

1053
02:57:50,000 --> 02:57:53,000
If you think about when I compute the pivotal look at the both sides.

1054
02:57:53,000 --> 02:57:58,000
Right. So alternative, there is something called the one side of the one-sided, one pale, everything.

1055
02:57:58,000 --> 02:58:02,000
Okay, and those can be used. it's just exactly the thing to talk about right.

1056
02:58:02,000 --> 02:58:09,000
If you if your alternative is really on one side on you have strong belief, that's the only thing you need to care about.

1057
02:58:09,000 --> 02:58:13,000
You could do the one side thing, and the only you know you still commit a key statistic.

1058
02:58:13,000 --> 02:58:23,000
Exactly the same way you just have. when you computer P value you only look at one side of the key rather than 2, you know, rather than 2 sides.

1059
02:58:23,000 --> 02:58:31,000
You could do that. I'm not going to too much detail between whether you should do one or the other.

1060
02:58:31,000 --> 02:58:36,000
But the take on message is that the 2 side tests are more conservative.

1061
02:58:36,000 --> 02:58:43,000
So this is more i'm sorry in the sense that you give you a more larger P.

1062
02:58:43,000 --> 02:59:00,000
Value everything else equal. So you're less likely to reject it Now, on the other hand, you also control the type on arrow bad because for the one side it has, You are making assumption that the other side never happened i'm not something maybe

1063
02:59:00,000 --> 02:59:12,000
violated right. If that happens, everything is cool. So unless you are 100%, sure by only a new care of all one tail, you should always use 2 sided paths for W.

1064
02:59:12,000 --> 02:59:20,000
Even you have a strong Pd. right. If you have a strong belief that only one side is is, how can it happen?

1065
02:59:20,000 --> 02:59:28,000
You still do to try to pass just for the sake of conservative.

1066
02:59:28,000 --> 02:59:35,000
Okay, there are cases, you know, I don't want to rule out There are cases one side that has could come in handy could be reasonable to do, but those are rare most of the time.

1067
02:59:35,000 --> 02:59:40,000
You do 2 side tests that's Why, I don't I didn't spend too much time here.

1068
02:59:40,000 --> 02:59:46,000
But did I answer a question? Thank you. So I agree with you.

1069
02:59:46,000 --> 02:59:48,000
You know, maybe one side. it has to make more sense here.

1070
02:59:48,000 --> 02:59:52,000
But for the sake of being conservative, to protect pipeline error.

1071
02:59:52,000 --> 03:00:01,000
2 sizes is a bad way. Okay, So here, right because we failed to reject the null.

1072
03:00:01,000 --> 03:00:05,000
So there's not enough evidence that the average is not funny 800.

1073
03:00:05,000 --> 03:00:08,000
So either. you want to establish that this group has a lower way.

1074
03:00:08,000 --> 03:00:11,000
A party will fail, because the sample actually has a higher wave.

1075
03:00:11,000 --> 03:00:20,000
Not Harry Boring. What we establish that is new in New innovative, new new program is being.

1076
03:00:20,000 --> 03:00:26,000
You know, helpful. You also fail because this one is not fake maybe it's different from 2,800.

1077
03:00:26,000 --> 03:00:45,000
So basically we cannot reject the No. but this may not mean actually the the difference. isn't there fail to reject now could possibly simply come from You have low power, which could be a cost point of small sample size, right if you have the

1078
03:00:45,000 --> 03:00:48,000
largest, Hamilton, you may actually reject them all.

1079
03:00:48,000 --> 03:00:56,000
So. So the curious thing you have to ask yourself is 3,083 ground right?

1080
03:00:56,000 --> 03:01:01,000
The difference between 3,083 from 2,800. Is that different?

1081
03:01:01,000 --> 03:01:08,000
Strong enough That, you think is scientifically meaningful that's number one number 2 is that if you think that sign?

1082
03:01:08,000 --> 03:01:12,000
Maybe the meaningful. then your sample size is too small.

1083
03:01:12,000 --> 03:01:18,000
The difference to be significant, which i'm saying that under repeated some morning.

1084
03:01:18,000 --> 03:01:26,000
Give up what you have. you know This difference may not hold, may not persist.

1085
03:01:26,000 --> 03:01:32,000
You might see some the difference going away, or even flip the sign, because your samples are not too small.

1086
03:01:32,000 --> 03:01:35,000
Now today the you know. The uncertainty overwhelmed the the signal right.

1087
03:01:35,000 --> 03:01:42,000
You observe the signal, but I certainly is too big so you don't have power to to establish it.

1088
03:01:42,000 --> 03:01:51,000
That's the conclusion right? So we failed to reject it. Now we don't have enough evidence go again, for now that's the conclusion is that nothing about whether the now is really true.

1089
03:01:51,000 --> 03:02:02,000
Of course we just failed rejected question if there's any

1090
03:02:02,000 --> 03:02:08,000
So quick question about. There is not enough evidence that the average is not 28.

1091
03:02:08,000 --> 03:02:13,000
I I I get the reject the null based on the p-value i'm struggling a little bit with that.

1092
03:02:13,000 --> 03:02:18,000
There's not enough evidence that the average is not 2,800.

1093
03:02:18,000 --> 03:02:22,000
Oh, oh, sorry! I made a I made a huge mistake here i'm sorry the P.

1094
03:02:22,000 --> 03:02:26,000
Is actually last time. point Oh, 5 right Oh, i'm totally wrong.

1095
03:02:26,000 --> 03:02:31,000
Sorry about it. I don't know what i'm thinking some evidence.

1096
03:02:31,000 --> 03:02:40,000
I'm sorry for confusing some of it is There's evidence average. it's not. I feel we reject them, though i'm sorry I don't know what.

1097
03:02:40,000 --> 03:02:43,000
Okay, alright, thanks for pointing out I mean i'm.

1098
03:02:43,000 --> 03:02:49,000
Really I I don't know after 3 h of this i'm, not fine to will play manual house with my own phone.

1099
03:02:49,000 --> 03:02:53,000
Maybe the not enough 3 plus 9 it's causing this sorry.

1100
03:02:53,000 --> 03:02:56,000
Apparent. Apparently we reject the not so there is evidence is not only in 100.

1101
03:02:56,000 --> 03:03:01,000
Hello, i'm thinking so. what I I was at only applies when the P.

1102
03:03:01,000 --> 03:03:07,000
Is log of that point will find but just just a small sample.

1103
03:03:07,000 --> 03:03:11,000
So I still would you still sort of take that into account?

1104
03:03:11,000 --> 03:03:18,000
Simultaneously

1105
03:03:18,000 --> 03:03:21,000
I think simultaneously. you know even the sign of that malar.

1106
03:03:21,000 --> 03:03:27,000
The Peabody is small enough. So now we think this difference is significant.

1107
03:03:27,000 --> 03:03:30,000
So the retainer would would be that if you repeat the experiment.

1108
03:03:30,000 --> 03:03:37,000
It's more likely that this conclusion will state rather than being flipped.

1109
03:03:37,000 --> 03:03:41,000
Thank you so much, so yeah, I mean that's a good sign right.

1110
03:03:41,000 --> 03:03:49,000
You have this this particular 3,083 come from this new prenatal program. Then congratulate the program.

1111
03:03:49,000 --> 03:03:55,000
Seem to be working. Yeah, So that's the I think if you are the pi of this program.

1112
03:03:55,000 --> 03:04:18,000
You'll be very glad to see this sorry sorry about that I think all the comments, questions

1113
03:04:18,000 --> 03:04:25,000
Yeah, see. this this kind of thing is easy to yeah no it's cute.

1114
03:04:25,000 --> 03:04:31,000
I I sure Don't make a mistake but i'm just saying it's easy for a yeah gospel it off.

1115
03:04:31,000 --> 03:04:41,000
What's your thinking? Okay, Number 3 the national center, for health Statistics published a report that indicate I 2,002 American paid the average of this per year, right?

1116
03:04:41,000 --> 03:04:46,000
And then hypothetical, 2,005. This has decreased.

1117
03:04:46,000 --> 03:04:49,000
Q. to a availability with generic growth. The test topology.

1118
03:04:49,000 --> 03:04:55,000
They take a sample of size 100 and then got this some of you know Samo standard deviation.

1119
03:04:55,000 --> 03:05:05,000
I'm Sorry i'm jumping but anyone tell me what's the population here?

1120
03:05:05,000 --> 03:05:18,000
American, maybe a little more specific

1121
03:05:18,000 --> 03:05:27,000
American healthcare expenditures. American: Yeah. The popular and my health careare standards are their measurement.

1122
03:05:27,000 --> 03:05:37,000
America is the population. but I would say the American in 22,005 by something like that, cause, you know, the the population actually shift.

1123
03:05:37,000 --> 03:05:41,000
Was time right to be more specific. And now, who has? hey?

1124
03:05:41,000 --> 03:06:00,000
How perry expenditure you know generic drop right on drugs. I mean all medicational funding. i'll i'll i'll i'll i'll prescribe cross right because you're gonna

1125
03:06:00,000 --> 03:06:02,000
think about America. Well, now, I really need those kind of things.

1126
03:06:02,000 --> 03:06:06,000
They are not really part of the population. Nevertheless, yeah, America, and pull down.

1127
03:06:06,000 --> 03:06:11,000
The 5 should be good enough, so the primary interest I would just go ahead.

1128
03:06:11,000 --> 03:06:22,000
Would it be the mean? expanded her dropped right on this left zoom, pulls out and fine right?

1129
03:06:22,000 --> 03:06:39,000
So then all have all this it's not would be yeah let's say the parameter is meal No, i'm not saying the mule should equal to Wow, what number should you pay.

1130
03:06:39,000 --> 03:06:46,000
Here 33 o 2, they all, too, hey? age.

1131
03:06:46,000 --> 03:06:55,000
Leave new again. Not equal 33, whole, 2. You could say the hypothesis really saying they have decreased bye.

1132
03:06:55,000 --> 03:06:59,000
So, for, say it's last time but for the sake of conservativeness.

1133
03:06:59,000 --> 03:07:06,000
We pulled it. Not equal right really here, if you think about it, the math ticket are actually they hypnotized that the number actually not equal.

1134
03:07:06,000 --> 03:07:13,000
But yet they still put a null as equal, because they want to collect data rejecting all right, cause you only rejected.

1135
03:07:13,000 --> 03:07:18,000
Now you can not accept it Now that's Why, you need to flip your hobbyist put the y one reject.

1136
03:07:18,000 --> 03:07:22,000
I don't know right the wife on the proof as the targetable.

1137
03:07:22,000 --> 03:07:27,000
They're gonna think about really which one you're assuming right You are actually swimming in a target by you.

1138
03:07:27,000 --> 03:07:38,000
Put them all there to retire, and then you do the calculation, I mean I I I won't go How do it by Eventually, when you do it, you will get the T.

1139
03:07:38,000 --> 03:07:51,000
Equals minus 1 point, 2, 6. So who want to make a jazz of the piece?

1140
03:07:51,000 --> 03:07:53,000
Is it last time going to 5 or a half point? 0?

1141
03:07:53,000 --> 03:08:00,000
5 larger than 25. Okay, Yeah. cool. So that actually the P.

1142
03:08:00,000 --> 03:08:11,000
Turn off would be point 2, one, And then, yeah, this is the case where fail to reject the null.

1143
03:08:11,000 --> 03:08:21,000
Well, you more specifically right, not enough. How about this? That, the average?

1144
03:08:21,000 --> 03:08:32,000
You expanded her decreased

1145
03:08:32,000 --> 03:08:41,000
2,005, so that's the conclusion So I have A. and I tried to be picking.

1146
03:08:41,000 --> 03:08:49,000
So I have a problem here, so we all know the expenditure is something to do with money, right?

1147
03:08:49,000 --> 03:08:59,000
Without any more information, I would guess the distribution of expanded, or to be skewed to the right.

1148
03:08:59,000 --> 03:09:08,000
I think they spend it on blocks, on prescribed drugs probably be much better than a total medical expanse. Right?

1149
03:09:08,000 --> 03:09:10,000
I think about the whole population. Some people most people are reasonably healthy.

1150
03:09:10,000 --> 03:09:19,000
They don't spend a lot right but a small percentage of people spend a lot like 100,000.

1151
03:09:19,000 --> 03:09:27,000
You by you, because that's something to do with money right So the average expenditure is again not very representative of the typical Americans spending the year.

1152
03:09:27,000 --> 03:09:37,000
I I think our prescription draws probably is better than the total expanation, but still we don't know that the tributary, so the whole analysis still applied right.

1153
03:09:37,000 --> 03:09:42,000
The the conclusion on the publish I mean everything but manager still correct.

1154
03:09:42,000 --> 03:09:46,000
Well, I would be interested in what's the mean what's the meeting management?

1155
03:09:46,000 --> 03:09:55,000
Does that give you even more information? What What a typical American, my man

1156
03:09:55,000 --> 03:10:05,000
Yeah, that's. my my take there but it's beyond what the question is asking, I'm just you know showing you how I would think about the problem

1157
03:10:05,000 --> 03:10:21,000
Any question here

1158
03:10:21,000 --> 03:10:27,000
Alright. number 4,

1159
03:10:27,000 --> 03:10:37,000
During a political debate. A lot of people candidates say that the Arabian American family has an income of $64,000 a year based on Amy Ts data.

1160
03:10:37,000 --> 03:10:42,000
Do you agree or disagree? I think this go back to what we did yesterday?

1161
03:10:42,000 --> 03:10:45,000
Oh, i'm epsilon but now we do have all testing right.

1162
03:10:45,000 --> 03:10:51,000
So all we need to do I will show you this is a more similar to a sort of a real data analysis. Right?

1163
03:10:51,000 --> 03:11:04,000
We open the radical expenditure data

1164
03:11:04,000 --> 03:11:11,000
Let me open both, and also the one Samokitas sheet.

1165
03:11:11,000 --> 03:11:17,000
Alright.

1166
03:11:17,000 --> 03:11:24,000
You all know this already. I just show very quickly. So you go to the medical expenditure data.

1167
03:11:24,000 --> 03:11:31,000
No, i'm epsilon i'll take all the average teamom family income is this column.

1168
03:11:31,000 --> 03:11:35,000
Yeah. call to the ppaspier, hey? Stick here.

1169
03:11:35,000 --> 03:11:41,000
The reference value should be 64, right in the unit of 1,000.

1170
03:11:41,000 --> 03:11:46,000
Oh, see, the P. vio is larger than Point Oh 5.

1171
03:11:46,000 --> 03:11:53,000
The common interval includes 64. therefore you fail to reject the no right.

1172
03:11:53,000 --> 03:12:00,000
So the conclusion would be, Yeah, we don't have evidence showing this politician is same.

1173
03:12:00,000 --> 03:12:07,000
I'm. True, they may not be lying right I will say the Polish don't always lie.

1174
03:12:07,000 --> 03:12:18,000
I'm say we don't have evidence go against their claim from this data, any question

1175
03:12:18,000 --> 03:12:22,000
As a statement, right? he equals 0 point 0 7 right, hey?

1176
03:12:22,000 --> 03:12:31,000
All who will retract. No, no. Finally, similarly, the kind of they also stay.

1177
03:12:31,000 --> 03:12:35,000
The average amount of family spend $560 a year.

1178
03:12:35,000 --> 03:12:41,000
All the pocket medical expense, and let's do the same thing here right?

1179
03:12:41,000 --> 03:12:54,000
Oh, we just go find the right variable. All the pocket manager

1180
03:12:54,000 --> 03:13:09,000
I think it this one. Let me let me take a look

1181
03:13:09,000 --> 03:13:14,000
Should be health care, because I need her paid about self Right?

1182
03:13:14,000 --> 03:13:27,000
That should be the one. Call them R. here, and then go to the scratchy place.

1183
03:13:27,000 --> 03:13:32,000
The column here, and then the reference number is $506.

1184
03:13:32,000 --> 03:13:45,000
So in the union of 1,000. now 0 point 5, 6. Again we cannot reject them all by the P is point 0 point. one.

1185
03:13:45,000 --> 03:13:56,000
One. can I reject them? All right, So please 0 point 1, one, No.

1186
03:13:56,000 --> 03:14:07,000
So this this political candidate, the stating, I think you know, according to to the data right, something close to the truth.

1187
03:14:07,000 --> 03:14:13,000
Nevertheless, right automatically expanded her again. will be skew right.

1188
03:14:13,000 --> 03:14:26,000
Some people spend a lot. some people spend very little, so this number may not be representative or typical America, but nevertheless, you know, his statement seem to be solid again.

1189
03:14:26,000 --> 03:14:49,000
The data. Okay, Any questions, so far.

1190
03:14:49,000 --> 03:15:07,000
Yeah, I think that's enough. on this and then remember turning in 60 and the pulse like a quick and we have a little time, you know.

1191
03:15:07,000 --> 03:15:12,000
If any of you wants to talk about anything, that you read on public house, I'm more happy to take it give you Kansas.

1192
03:15:12,000 --> 03:15:17,000
If nobody wants to talk about, you know I I probably will start the next lecture a little bit.

1193
03:15:17,000 --> 03:15:21,000
So to save time for tomorrow

1194
03:15:21,000 --> 03:15:26,000
I prefer some of you. The pocket vectors are boring by the Yeah, I understand.

1195
03:15:26,000 --> 03:15:32,000
If nobody wants to talk

1196
03:15:32,000 --> 03:15:44,000
What I can do. Yeah, anyone on the top
