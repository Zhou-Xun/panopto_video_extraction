00:00:08,830 --> 00:00:17,980
Confounding is a phenomenon whether is an alternate explanation or explanations for some observed associations between an exposure and an outcome.

2
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:25,090
It's a common concern when conducting epidemiological research because we live in such a multifactorial world.

3
00:00:25,540 --> 00:00:30,040
In fact, it's very rare that someone only has one risk factor for a certain disease.

4
00:00:30,430 --> 00:00:36,130
Rather, they often have a whole host of conditions that put them at higher or lower risk of a disease.

5
00:00:36,550 --> 00:00:41,950
Take me, for example, when thinking about my cardiovascular risk, one must consider my age.

6
00:00:42,220 --> 00:00:46,150
My family history of disease, along with my diet, exercise.

7
00:00:46,150 --> 00:00:53,740
And how much sleep I get. In this video, we'll first revisit the definition of confounding that you've seen before,

8
00:00:54,070 --> 00:00:59,980
and then we'll work through examples in order to identify simple rules that indicate the presence of confounding.

9
00:01:01,190 --> 00:01:07,759
So let's start at the top. Confounding is a situation in which an association between a given exposure and

10
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:12,800
outcome is distorted as a result of the influence of a third extraneous variable.

11
00:01:13,490 --> 00:01:21,080
It includes creating an association where one does not exist or changing the magnitude or value of that association.

12
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:25,710
It's this confusion of a fact that we had talked about previously.

13
00:01:26,340 --> 00:01:30,030
However, to be sure that everyone has a firm understanding of the concept.

14
00:01:30,270 --> 00:01:37,070
Let's walk through an example. So take this tale of two women, Maria and Alia.

15
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:40,850
Both women are in their mid-forties and grew up in the same town.

16
00:01:41,240 --> 00:01:45,800
On the left, we have Maria, who works an office job in a public relations consulting firm.

17
00:01:46,370 --> 00:01:54,350
Because she works long hours, she has little time for exercise, often eats pre-prepared food at her desk and doesn't get a lot of sleep at night.

18
00:01:55,100 --> 00:01:59,990
On the right is aliya. Aliya works as a graphic designer out of her house.

19
00:02:00,370 --> 00:02:06,050
She's a vegan, competitive runner and believes that 8 hours of sleep is critically important for good health.

20
00:02:06,380 --> 00:02:13,590
So she tries to get that every night. Given the personal characteristics of each of these women,

21
00:02:13,590 --> 00:02:20,340
it would not be a surprise to know that Maria's lifetime risk for heart attack is greater than that of aliya.

22
00:02:21,630 --> 00:02:26,700
The challenge, however, is determining why Maria's risk of heart attack is higher than in the US.

23
00:02:27,090 --> 00:02:30,840
In other words, what's the causal factor for the difference in risk between the two?

24
00:02:31,290 --> 00:02:35,490
Is it because of Maria's lack of exercise, poor diet or less sleep?

25
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:41,280
All of these are plausible explanations for her increased risk, but they all occur together.

26
00:02:41,670 --> 00:02:48,240
So how do we know if one of these characteristics is causal and if they are all causal factors for heart disease?

27
00:02:48,510 --> 00:02:52,290
How do we isolate the independent impact of one versus another?

28
00:02:53,190 --> 00:02:59,790
At its core, this confusion of results is the challenge of confounding, as you've heard before.

29
00:02:59,850 --> 00:03:08,850
Confounding occurs when a third factor is associated with the exposure of interest, as well as an independent risk factor for the outcome.

30
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:16,530
In addition, you also know that a confounder cannot be on the causal pathway between the exposure and the outcome.

31
00:03:18,030 --> 00:03:20,970
Applying these simple rules to our specific scenario,

32
00:03:21,180 --> 00:03:28,620
we would worry about sleep and exercise as confounding for the Association of Eating Healthy on Cardiovascular Risk.

33
00:03:28,920 --> 00:03:35,520
Because both of these factors are associated with eating healthy, and they're both risk factors for cardiovascular disease.

34
00:03:35,850 --> 00:03:39,090
In fact, they're both protective factors for cardiovascular disease.

35
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:45,450
You could similarly flip the diagram and worry about healthy eating as a confounder of any observed

36
00:03:45,450 --> 00:03:52,380
association that was seen between exercise and heart disease or quality of sleep and heart disease as well.

37
00:03:54,070 --> 00:03:55,479
In all of these cases,

38
00:03:55,480 --> 00:04:04,090
we expect to see an exaggerated protective effect for any of the risk factors of interest on heart health because of confounding by the other factors.

39
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:12,820
For example, since people that eat healthy also exercise and sleep, more and more exercise and sleep leads to fewer heart attacks.

40
00:04:13,150 --> 00:04:22,210
We expect that healthy eating will look even more protective for cardiovascular risk than if the impacts of eating could be isolated by themselves.

41
00:04:23,350 --> 00:04:32,320
Effectively, this exaggeration of the protective effect occurs because the Crude Association includes not only the contribution of the exposure,

42
00:04:32,620 --> 00:04:39,160
but the contribution of the confounder as well. This makes it very difficult to observe true associations.

43
00:04:40,630 --> 00:04:46,510
In summary, confounding is a phenomenon where another factor represents an alternate explanation for

44
00:04:46,510 --> 00:04:51,920
the observed associations between and exposure and an outcome by its simplest definition.

45
00:04:51,940 --> 00:04:56,620
Confounding occurs when a variable is associated with the exposure of interest.

46
00:04:57,070 --> 00:05:04,180
A risk factor for the outcome in the absence of the exposure, and not on the causal pathway between the exposure and the outcome.
