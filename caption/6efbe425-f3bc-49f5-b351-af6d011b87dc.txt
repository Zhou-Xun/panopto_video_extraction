1
00:00:09,080 --> 00:00:13,410
Hi everyone, and welcome
back to Nutrition 590.

2
00:00:13,410 --> 00:00:15,795
Now that we understand
the different types of

3
00:00:15,795 --> 00:00:18,000
epigenetic modifications and how

4
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,270
epidemiologists and basic
science use epigenetics

5
00:00:21,270 --> 00:00:23,700
to study human
development and disease,

6
00:00:23,700 --> 00:00:25,470
how can we now put

7
00:00:25,470 --> 00:00:28,530
this knowledge to use for
public health practice?

8
00:00:28,530 --> 00:00:32,100
For example, can we use
epigenetic data when

9
00:00:32,100 --> 00:00:33,780
thinking about the risk that

10
00:00:33,780 --> 00:00:36,180
certain chemicals
pose to our health?

11
00:00:36,180 --> 00:00:38,700
This is a term in
environmental health policy

12
00:00:38,700 --> 00:00:40,590
called risk assessment.

13
00:00:40,590 --> 00:00:43,684
Or for example, should we use

14
00:00:43,684 --> 00:00:47,915
an epigenome to predict an
individual's risk of disease?

15
00:00:47,915 --> 00:00:50,030
Are there any ethical
considerations

16
00:00:50,030 --> 00:00:51,895
associated with that?

17
00:00:51,895 --> 00:00:54,050
The first learning objective of

18
00:00:54,050 --> 00:00:56,420
this module is to
observe examples

19
00:00:56,420 --> 00:00:57,890
of how epigenetics is being

20
00:00:57,890 --> 00:01:01,060
communicated to lay audiences.

21
00:01:01,060 --> 00:01:04,025
Second, begin to understand

22
00:01:04,025 --> 00:01:07,870
the ethical considerations
of epigenetic studies.

23
00:01:07,870 --> 00:01:10,690
Here is a brochure that
one of the masters of

24
00:01:10,690 --> 00:01:12,125
Public Health students picked up

25
00:01:12,125 --> 00:01:14,635
recently at a doctor's office.

26
00:01:14,635 --> 00:01:17,495
It uses infographics to describe

27
00:01:17,495 --> 00:01:20,770
epigenetics as beyond the DNA.

28
00:01:20,770 --> 00:01:23,475
You will see the phrase epi-what?

29
00:01:23,475 --> 00:01:26,840
Well, it's epigenetics, a
relatively new field that's

30
00:01:26,840 --> 00:01:30,535
causing quite a bit of buzz
in the scientific community.

31
00:01:30,535 --> 00:01:33,800
In fact, the brochure
says, "In many ways,

32
00:01:33,800 --> 00:01:36,635
epigenetics is the
ultimate intersection

33
00:01:36,635 --> 00:01:39,140
between your lifestyle
and your health,

34
00:01:39,140 --> 00:01:42,385
or perhaps even the
health of your children."

35
00:01:42,385 --> 00:01:44,450
The brochure goes on to explain

36
00:01:44,450 --> 00:01:47,480
the epigenome using a
light switch metaphor,

37
00:01:47,480 --> 00:01:50,000
and acknowledges that
many lifestyle choices

38
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:53,395
and exposures can
affect our epigenome.

39
00:01:53,395 --> 00:01:57,170
The last part of the brochure
shows the nitty gritty,

40
00:01:57,170 --> 00:01:59,810
the details of histone
modifications and

41
00:01:59,810 --> 00:02:02,345
chromatin structure
that leaves patients

42
00:02:02,345 --> 00:02:04,115
with a glimpse of
the importance of

43
00:02:04,115 --> 00:02:07,615
epigenetics in the developmental
origins of disease.

44
00:02:07,615 --> 00:02:09,755
It says, "We are learning that

45
00:02:09,755 --> 00:02:11,630
epigenetic changes may be passed

46
00:02:11,630 --> 00:02:13,745
down from parent to child,

47
00:02:13,745 --> 00:02:16,310
directly affecting
genes that control

48
00:02:16,310 --> 00:02:19,085
risk for conditions
such as obesity,

49
00:02:19,085 --> 00:02:22,640
diabetes, anxiety,
and depression."

50
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:25,730
Now take a moment. How would you

51
00:02:25,730 --> 00:02:26,870
feel if you read

52
00:02:26,870 --> 00:02:29,555
this brochure before you
had taken this class?

53
00:02:29,555 --> 00:02:32,990
Or how might you explain
it to a friend or

54
00:02:32,990 --> 00:02:34,490
neighbor who brings it

55
00:02:34,490 --> 00:02:37,580
home from their physical
therapy appointment?

56
00:02:37,580 --> 00:02:40,970
Well, it turns out that
epigenetics is also

57
00:02:40,970 --> 00:02:43,805
a popular topic of
other media outlets.

58
00:02:43,805 --> 00:02:45,630
Here you see the headline,

59
00:02:45,630 --> 00:02:47,660
"Kill All the Mosquitoes."

60
00:02:47,660 --> 00:02:49,250
It turns out there's

61
00:02:49,250 --> 00:02:52,400
new genetic editing
technology that gives science

62
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:53,690
the ability to wipe out

63
00:02:53,690 --> 00:02:57,170
the carriers of malaria
and the Zika virus.

64
00:02:57,170 --> 00:02:58,880
But should they use it?

65
00:02:58,880 --> 00:03:02,810
This is asking, should we
edit the DNA methylation of

66
00:03:02,810 --> 00:03:04,730
mosquitoes to make them

67
00:03:04,730 --> 00:03:08,125
inefficient at
transmitting the diseases?

68
00:03:08,125 --> 00:03:12,215
It turns out we have laws
to address genetic editing.

69
00:03:12,215 --> 00:03:15,905
The laws were first
proposed back in the 1990s.

70
00:03:15,905 --> 00:03:19,160
In 1995, Congresswoman
Louise Slaughter

71
00:03:19,160 --> 00:03:22,775
and Senator Olympia
Snowe, first introduced

72
00:03:22,775 --> 00:03:26,345
federal legislation limiting
genetic discrimination.

73
00:03:26,345 --> 00:03:27,980
This was called GINA,

74
00:03:27,980 --> 00:03:31,250
the Genetic Information
Nondiscrimination Act

75
00:03:31,250 --> 00:03:32,905
in Health Insurance.

76
00:03:32,905 --> 00:03:35,225
They envisioned the bill ideally

77
00:03:35,225 --> 00:03:37,940
passed by the completion of
the Human Genome Project,

78
00:03:37,940 --> 00:03:40,505
which remember was
in the early 2000s,

79
00:03:40,505 --> 00:03:43,940
would allay public fears
of genetic discrimination,

80
00:03:43,940 --> 00:03:47,330
promote public participation
in medical research,

81
00:03:47,330 --> 00:03:50,195
and prevent genetic
discrimination.

82
00:03:50,195 --> 00:03:52,460
This original bill failed to

83
00:03:52,460 --> 00:03:55,115
pass either the
House or the Senate,

84
00:03:55,115 --> 00:03:57,590
and variations of
the legislation,

85
00:03:57,590 --> 00:04:00,380
ultimately expanding to
include protection in

86
00:04:00,380 --> 00:04:03,635
employment were introduced
in each subsequent Congress,

87
00:04:03,635 --> 00:04:07,210
and the bills enjoyed
broad bipartisan support.

88
00:04:07,210 --> 00:04:09,530
Finally, in 2008,

89
00:04:09,530 --> 00:04:13,475
the Genetic Information
Nondiscrimination Act was passed.

90
00:04:13,475 --> 00:04:16,220
It is designed to prohibit
the improper use of

91
00:04:16,220 --> 00:04:19,885
genetic information in health
insurance and employment.

92
00:04:19,885 --> 00:04:22,670
The Act prohibits
group health plans and

93
00:04:22,670 --> 00:04:24,170
health insurers from denying

94
00:04:24,170 --> 00:04:26,030
coverage to healthy individuals,

95
00:04:26,030 --> 00:04:27,920
or charging that person

96
00:04:27,920 --> 00:04:31,720
higher premiums based solely
on genetic predisposition.

97
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:34,855
The legislation also
bars employers from

98
00:04:34,855 --> 00:04:36,950
individual's genetic
information when

99
00:04:36,950 --> 00:04:38,675
making decisions about hiring,

100
00:04:38,675 --> 00:04:41,965
firing, job placement
or promotion.

101
00:04:41,965 --> 00:04:45,050
At the time, Senator Ted
Kennedy called it the

102
00:04:45,050 --> 00:04:49,520
first major new civil rights
bill of the new century.

103
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:52,430
A leading ethicists
on the epigenome is

104
00:04:52,430 --> 00:04:55,385
Mark Rothstein from the
Institute for Bioethics,

105
00:04:55,385 --> 00:04:58,730
Health Policy and Law at the
University of Louisville.

106
00:04:58,730 --> 00:05:01,160
He describes four domains of

107
00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:03,770
legal implications
for epigenetics.

108
00:05:03,770 --> 00:05:06,770
The first is the
regulation of research.

109
00:05:06,770 --> 00:05:09,350
Many people consent to storing

110
00:05:09,350 --> 00:05:12,410
their biological specimens
and data for genetics.

111
00:05:12,410 --> 00:05:15,920
But does this consent
expand to the epigenome?

112
00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:17,450
This is particularly important in

113
00:05:17,450 --> 00:05:19,460
birth cohorts where
infants samples are

114
00:05:19,460 --> 00:05:21,050
stored for decades and

115
00:05:21,050 --> 00:05:25,400
infants aren't explicitly
consented. Second, litigation,

116
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:28,085
and in particular,
third-generation claims.

117
00:05:28,085 --> 00:05:30,755
For example, can
an individual sue

118
00:05:30,755 --> 00:05:32,450
a chemical company because

119
00:05:32,450 --> 00:05:34,040
his grandmother was exposed

120
00:05:34,040 --> 00:05:36,235
to a solvent at her workplace?

121
00:05:36,235 --> 00:05:38,445
Third, patenting.

122
00:05:38,445 --> 00:05:40,550
Can epigenetic gene patterns

123
00:05:40,550 --> 00:05:42,905
be patented when
they are discovered?

124
00:05:42,905 --> 00:05:44,390
What about models such as

125
00:05:44,390 --> 00:05:46,715
that viable yellow agouti mouse?

126
00:05:46,715 --> 00:05:51,335
Finally, if exposures lead
to changes in the epigenome,

127
00:05:51,335 --> 00:05:53,000
which regulatory body is

128
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:56,035
responsible for
evaluating the risks?

129
00:05:56,035 --> 00:05:58,220
Well, it turns out
there are a number of

130
00:05:58,220 --> 00:06:00,575
different regulatory bodies
in the United States

131
00:06:00,575 --> 00:06:02,210
responsible for
the legislation of

132
00:06:02,210 --> 00:06:05,000
exposures that might
affect our epigenome.

133
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:08,165
First, the US Environmental
Protection Agency

134
00:06:08,165 --> 00:06:10,850
evaluates environmental
legislation,

135
00:06:10,850 --> 00:06:14,510
but most laws require
an adverse effect.

136
00:06:14,510 --> 00:06:19,045
Is a change in DNA methylation
always an adverse effect?

137
00:06:19,045 --> 00:06:23,540
Second, the Food and Drug
Administration or FDA evaluates

138
00:06:23,540 --> 00:06:26,150
drugs which individuals usually

139
00:06:26,150 --> 00:06:28,700
intentionally take
for a medical reason.

140
00:06:28,700 --> 00:06:30,290
What if these pharmaceuticals

141
00:06:30,290 --> 00:06:32,515
have epigenetic side effects?

142
00:06:32,515 --> 00:06:36,290
Also, what about FDA regulation
of food and cosmetics?

143
00:06:36,290 --> 00:06:39,260
Should FDA now be
required to evaluate

144
00:06:39,260 --> 00:06:43,210
epigenetic changes of these
diverse classes of exposure?

145
00:06:43,210 --> 00:06:45,695
Finally, OSHA ensures

146
00:06:45,695 --> 00:06:48,715
workplace safety via
exposure monitoring.

147
00:06:48,715 --> 00:06:50,750
Should safe levels now be

148
00:06:50,750 --> 00:06:52,310
re-evaluated based on what

149
00:06:52,310 --> 00:06:54,065
we've learned about
the epigenome?

150
00:06:54,065 --> 00:06:56,240
What about for women
of child-bearing age,

151
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:57,770
when we know the epigenome is

152
00:06:57,770 --> 00:07:00,610
reprogrammed very
early in pregnancy?

153
00:07:00,610 --> 00:07:04,940
Lastly, I want us to consider
the cloned sheep, Dolly.

154
00:07:04,940 --> 00:07:07,820
This reporter argues
that Dolly was lucky.

155
00:07:07,820 --> 00:07:09,590
Scientists warn that cloning

156
00:07:09,590 --> 00:07:11,935
is just too dangerous for people.

157
00:07:11,935 --> 00:07:15,290
Cloned animals like Dolly
are created through

158
00:07:15,290 --> 00:07:18,425
a process called somatic
cell nuclear transfer,

159
00:07:18,425 --> 00:07:20,765
where the nucleus
of a normal cell,

160
00:07:20,765 --> 00:07:23,315
which contains the DNA
of the individual,

161
00:07:23,315 --> 00:07:25,850
is transplanted into
an egg cell that

162
00:07:25,850 --> 00:07:28,955
has been reprogrammed
in a totipotent cell.

163
00:07:28,955 --> 00:07:30,845
If all goes well,

164
00:07:30,845 --> 00:07:32,720
a genetically identical clone of

165
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:34,910
the donating
individual is created.

166
00:07:34,910 --> 00:07:37,085
But things don't
always go so well.

167
00:07:37,085 --> 00:07:38,945
For example, in
the case of Dolly,

168
00:07:38,945 --> 00:07:42,110
the procedure had to be
carried out more than 270

169
00:07:42,110 --> 00:07:44,195
times before the first fetus

170
00:07:44,195 --> 00:07:46,240
was successfully brought to term.

171
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:48,770
But more importantly, recently,

172
00:07:48,770 --> 00:07:50,960
scientists have concluded that

173
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:53,120
epigenetic factors are not

174
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:55,925
completely reprogrammed
in cloned animals.

175
00:07:55,925 --> 00:07:58,700
Therefore, many of the effects

176
00:07:58,700 --> 00:08:00,320
of cloned animals
that are negative

177
00:08:00,320 --> 00:08:02,825
are due to improper reprogramming

178
00:08:02,825 --> 00:08:05,695
of the DNA methylation
and histone codes.

179
00:08:05,695 --> 00:08:07,790
Let's end by reflecting on

180
00:08:07,790 --> 00:08:11,255
three broad ethical
considerations in epigenetics.

181
00:08:11,255 --> 00:08:13,910
First, environmental
justice describes

182
00:08:13,910 --> 00:08:15,590
a social movement that focuses

183
00:08:15,590 --> 00:08:17,690
on the fair distribution of

184
00:08:17,690 --> 00:08:20,390
environmental
benefits and burdens.

185
00:08:20,390 --> 00:08:22,295
In fact, in 2020,

186
00:08:22,295 --> 00:08:24,250
the University of
Michigan recognize

187
00:08:24,250 --> 00:08:25,730
the 30th anniversary of

188
00:08:25,730 --> 00:08:28,205
the first conference on
environmental racism,

189
00:08:28,205 --> 00:08:31,055
which happened here back in 1990.

190
00:08:31,055 --> 00:08:33,500
If environmental burdens are not

191
00:08:33,500 --> 00:08:36,680
equitable across
different groups,

192
00:08:36,680 --> 00:08:38,390
does this mean that epigenetic

193
00:08:38,390 --> 00:08:40,250
negative consequences may be

194
00:08:40,250 --> 00:08:41,420
disproportionally borne by

195
00:08:41,420 --> 00:08:44,525
certain socioeconomic
or racial groups?

196
00:08:44,525 --> 00:08:48,050
Further, this epigenetic
divide maybe widened by

197
00:08:48,050 --> 00:08:49,430
disproportional access to

198
00:08:49,430 --> 00:08:51,815
health care or
personalized medicine.

199
00:08:51,815 --> 00:08:54,770
Second, with the epigenome,

200
00:08:54,770 --> 00:08:57,260
do we now have more
personal responsibility

201
00:08:57,260 --> 00:08:59,375
over what we eat or drink?

202
00:08:59,375 --> 00:09:01,850
Or whether we exercise
or live healthy,

203
00:09:01,850 --> 00:09:04,190
now that we know that
our epigenetic fate

204
00:09:04,190 --> 00:09:06,680
can be transmitted
to our offspring?

205
00:09:06,680 --> 00:09:11,060
Lastly, are we thinking
carefully about how to safeguard

206
00:09:11,060 --> 00:09:13,594
research subjects
and patient privacy

207
00:09:13,594 --> 00:09:16,625
and confidentiality when
it comes to the epigenome?

208
00:09:16,625 --> 00:09:20,225
Would you allow your epigenome
to be publicly available?

209
00:09:20,225 --> 00:09:22,340
What about your
infant's DNA to be

210
00:09:22,340 --> 00:09:26,720
stored for future
epigenetic analyses?
