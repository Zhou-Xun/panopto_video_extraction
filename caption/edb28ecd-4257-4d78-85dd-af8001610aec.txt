1
00:00:09,680 --> 00:00:12,800
As we've alluded to up to now.

2
00:00:13,250 --> 00:00:20,000
And the government is an important provider and payer of health care in the United States.

3
00:00:20,360 --> 00:00:32,540
Medicare is an entitlement program for elderly, disabled and sustained renal disease patients and suicide end stage renal disease,

4
00:00:32,720 --> 00:00:41,090
kidney dialysis, usually only identifiable disease specifically covered under Medicare.

5
00:00:41,660 --> 00:00:47,000
Otherwise, if you're over 65, you're automatically HMO and disabled.

6
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:55,580
And any age you can participate in Medicare and are responsible for co-payments and deductibles.

7
00:00:56,270 --> 00:01:06,140
And not all needs are covered, for example. And there's no vision care under Medicare, which is kind of surprising, doesn't make much sense,

8
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:12,650
but that's the way it is, because Medicare doesn't cover all the needs.

9
00:01:13,220 --> 00:01:22,280
Many patients and most who can afford it purchase Medicare, a supplemental plan also known as many gap programs.

10
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:30,050
And they cover the interstices where Medicare doesn't cover a particular need.

11
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:42,260
Medicare currently has for part part A in-hospital insurance, part B in outpatient services.

12
00:01:42,620 --> 00:01:56,420
Part C is Medicare Advantage. And part time is really the growing part of Medicare, essentially a private sector alternative to Medicare Part A and B.

13
00:01:57,020 --> 00:02:05,870
And the advantage, you know, and not to me, honey, that plan may provide an additional benefit beyond Medicare.

14
00:02:06,290 --> 00:02:14,510
While the additional benefit rarely cover what a medigap or Medicare supplemental plan would cover,

15
00:02:14,990 --> 00:02:21,260
some people could be quite satisfied with a medicare Advantage program.

16
00:02:21,270 --> 00:02:30,739
The government has subsidized Medicare Advantage as an incentive for the private sector to build on this program,

17
00:02:30,740 --> 00:02:37,760
the idea being that the more people who are in the will use less Medicare.

18
00:02:38,330 --> 00:02:51,950
And that's important because the concern that with the baby boomer population, Medicare won't be fiscally stable over the long term.

19
00:02:52,430 --> 00:03:00,290
Part D was enacted under the Bush administration, and it provides pharmaceutical benefits.

20
00:03:00,650 --> 00:03:07,580
Initially, Medicare did not provide for pharmaceutical care at once until about 2005,

21
00:03:07,850 --> 00:03:13,850
when Part D was enacted to provide some level of pharmaceutical benefits.

22
00:03:14,420 --> 00:03:18,499
Partly complicated coverage up to a certain point.

23
00:03:18,500 --> 00:03:28,520
Then there's a gap and then it soon again. So a lot of attention in Congress and in part, the Affordable Care Act collapses that gap,

24
00:03:28,590 --> 00:03:39,080
the so-called donut hole in Medicare, Part D, Medicare, and in a highly successful and effective program.

25
00:03:40,100 --> 00:03:47,420
What what's been forgotten is that when Medicare and Medicaid were enacted in 1965,

26
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:55,380
many elderly were very poor and couldn't afford any health care at all.

27
00:03:55,850 --> 00:04:03,650
And Medicare was literally a life saver for a generation of elderly, low income people.

28
00:04:04,900 --> 00:04:09,850
Hey, the second year program, the government funds Medicaid.

29
00:04:10,420 --> 00:04:14,320
Medicare is strictly a federal governmental program.

30
00:04:14,590 --> 00:04:27,540
Medicaid, in contrast, is a combined federal and state program where the federal government set minimum levels of services and civically.

31
00:04:28,030 --> 00:04:32,600
There are certain benefits that must be provided.

32
00:04:32,620 --> 00:04:44,020
They're mandatory, but state can provide additional optional benefits given declining state budget and increasing Medicaid costs.

33
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:53,650
Only very wealthy states such as New York and California can really any more provide many optional benefits,

34
00:04:54,850 --> 00:05:02,140
more optional benefits, and provide the less money available from the expanding Medicaid population.

35
00:05:02,170 --> 00:05:10,660
What happened is that with the Affordable Care Act, one reason the uninsured have gone down,

36
00:05:11,260 --> 00:05:18,280
many have gone on to Medicaid that was expanded under the Affordable Care Act.

37
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:24,700
Medicaid operates on a formula that determines how much federal funding will match.

38
00:05:25,030 --> 00:05:32,350
The minimum is 50%. The government matched 5000 Medicaid under the Medicaid expansion.

39
00:05:32,710 --> 00:05:38,080
The government pays 100% for the expanded population for ten years.

40
00:05:38,980 --> 00:05:42,400
There are strict eligibility and financial requirements.

41
00:05:42,820 --> 00:05:46,090
Not everyone is eligible for Medicaid.

42
00:05:46,100 --> 00:05:51,280
The really categorically eligible program, for example,

43
00:05:51,550 --> 00:06:00,460
healthy non-working men generally not eligible, but women with children are initially eligible.

44
00:06:01,150 --> 00:06:04,960
Many states are now enacting work requirement.

45
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:12,760
Then if you go on Medicaid, you have to at least spend a certain number of hours looking for work.

46
00:06:13,390 --> 00:06:20,470
And I mentioned before, Medicaid is the largest funder of long term care.

47
00:06:21,070 --> 00:06:33,700
It's really primarily for lower middle income families who then spend down to meet Medicaid eligibility requirements for long term care.

48
00:06:33,910 --> 00:06:44,530
And the largest user of Medicaid. About 50% of all Medicaid dollars now are allocated to long term care.

49
00:06:45,190 --> 00:06:50,379
One of the most successful federal and state programs is the HAMP or the State

50
00:06:50,380 --> 00:06:56,440
Children's Health Insurance Program that provides care for all needy children.

51
00:06:57,040 --> 00:07:00,190
And that's been very successful.

52
00:07:00,520 --> 00:07:09,550
The main problem has been in some urban area, reaching low income families to have them apply for the program.

53
00:07:09,970 --> 00:07:15,110
There are some additional federal government programs that are very important to women.

54
00:07:15,220 --> 00:07:24,220
And for one, the veteran care, which in recent years has been an incubator for various quality improvement efforts.

55
00:07:24,700 --> 00:07:29,410
And that's really providing actually excellent parent to a large number of veterans.

56
00:07:29,740 --> 00:07:30,210
Right now,

57
00:07:30,220 --> 00:07:43,150
one of the problems that the VA faces is increasing number of psychiatric problems from returning veterans from recent war and Iraq and Afghanistan.

58
00:07:43,420 --> 00:07:49,990
Government also provides care for current service members and their families.

59
00:07:50,030 --> 00:07:54,009
The TRICARE program, one of the main about TRICARE,

60
00:07:54,010 --> 00:08:02,950
is having the government now provide more care through the private sector rather than through any governmental sources.

61
00:08:03,430 --> 00:08:12,190
And then there's the Indian Health Service, which was set up in 1955 to provide care to patients.

62
00:08:12,610 --> 00:08:16,330
And it's been important sort of health care for Native Americans.

63
00:08:16,660 --> 00:08:29,620
In addition to the care and insurance, the government and the larger sponsor of research probably in the world, the National Institutes of Health,

64
00:08:29,980 --> 00:08:42,160
and some of the most important breakthrough drugs, pharmaceuticals and medical device research, and also garnered bipartisan support.

65
00:08:42,550 --> 00:08:51,940
They're in different institutes of health. That's the National Institute of Mental Health, the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute.

66
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:57,560
National Cancer Institute. They all fund different niches of care.

67
00:08:57,580 --> 00:09:04,270
So most important research innovations have come from NIH sources and the.

68
00:09:04,940 --> 00:09:14,370
Hakim Fund Research on quality of care, one of the most endangered funding sources among government agencies.

69
00:09:14,740 --> 00:09:18,690
It's repeatedly on the chopping block for funding.

70
00:09:19,140 --> 00:09:23,340
But in Nick here, while it took a bit of a budget cut.

71
00:09:23,640 --> 00:09:28,890
It survived. And then the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

72
00:09:29,370 --> 00:09:36,900
And it's really our largest public health research and policy institute.

73
00:09:36,930 --> 00:09:48,690
Importance lies in its ability to build preparedness to prevent public health diseases, funds some vaccine research,

74
00:09:49,110 --> 00:09:54,120
and works with state and local health departments to prevent the spread of disease,

75
00:09:54,420 --> 00:10:04,860
to deal with dangerous epidemics such as serious flu varieties, Ebola, SA and other epidemics.

76
00:10:05,490 --> 00:10:17,900
So in the health care enterprise, incorporate all of the structural elements we've talked about so far and structure the workforce and financing,

77
00:10:18,510 --> 00:10:24,330
but also a lot of activity in the private sector.

78
00:10:24,900 --> 00:10:28,650
You have start up health care systems, for example.

79
00:10:28,890 --> 00:10:37,290
One medical is a new start up dealing with primary care here, medicine for primary care.

80
00:10:37,740 --> 00:10:42,180
Then you have venture capital buying up hospitals and managing them.

81
00:10:42,630 --> 00:10:49,740
You have venture capital going into the startups so that you can have new insurance

82
00:10:49,740 --> 00:10:55,470
providers such as Oscar and online insurance started with venture capital,

83
00:10:55,920 --> 00:11:06,390
joint venture or private sector arrangement, and we've defined them, combining for profit U.S. and the nonprofit healthcare enterprises.

84
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:14,040
Pharmaceutical manufacturers are all for profit enterprises conducting research and development

85
00:11:14,370 --> 00:11:21,989
to build and distribute pharmaceutical products for all sorts of diseases oncology,

86
00:11:21,990 --> 00:11:24,840
drugs, drugs to combat arthritis.

87
00:11:25,110 --> 00:11:34,920
Then you have a device maybe that is boning down on the normal medical equipment and again, all for profit companies.

88
00:11:35,310 --> 00:11:43,320
And then you have the entire health care supply chain through private sector vendor and from finance.

89
00:11:44,070 --> 00:11:56,340
One other enterprise had been mentioned and you may read about it, Amazon is now getting into the game in a big way and sharing in a new approach.

90
00:11:56,680 --> 00:12:10,030
Hiring Atul Gawande, a famous health care and commentator to build their enterprise, and getting more competition from the private sector.

91
00:12:10,050 --> 00:12:21,930
With the idea being that the private sector operating on a for profit basis will be able to attack the weaknesses of the current system,

92
00:12:21,930 --> 00:12:26,970
particularly to provide higher quality care at lower cost.
