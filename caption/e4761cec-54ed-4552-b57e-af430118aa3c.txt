1
00:00:01,200 --> 00:00:07,260
So. So we have a new topic today.

2
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:16,510
Yeah. So. So this topic is actually very complicated, but I'm going to make it as easy as possible.

3
00:00:16,530 --> 00:00:23,009
We are going to go through the really simple ways of collecting information whenever, because,

4
00:00:23,010 --> 00:00:29,640
of course, there are many models and kind of like ways that are beyond the scope of this course.

5
00:00:30,190 --> 00:00:38,730
So so I'm going to kind of like go over the types of error that I already show you briefly about a few weeks ago.

6
00:00:38,740 --> 00:00:47,250
But now we're going into more detail. Then we're going to see how to correct information whenever one we have already done.

7
00:00:47,400 --> 00:00:50,760
So kind of like we're closing circles, right?

8
00:00:51,030 --> 00:00:54,780
So remember, we corrected for the standard variations. We really saw that.

9
00:00:54,780 --> 00:00:58,200
So that's a way of getting rid of error, right? We would we know that.

10
00:00:58,240 --> 00:01:02,639
So then we will. We won't. I mean, I will briefly mention that,

11
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:09,719
but I want to go into that and then we will today we will focus on corrective measures of association

12
00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:15,450
like we will correct that as well in elevation correlation coefficients and relative risks.

13
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:21,150
Okay. So that's just for today. So well, I mean, not not everything for today.

14
00:01:22,140 --> 00:01:24,600
Part of this probably will go into next week.

15
00:01:25,080 --> 00:01:33,630
And then the good thing about this topic is that there are many SAS macros and other kind of like programs in other

16
00:01:34,110 --> 00:01:41,220
packages like R or data that you can use if you need to go read for that in the future using more complicated models.

17
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:47,460
So the idea is that you need to know exactly how to do it, why you need to run the macro, right?

18
00:01:47,700 --> 00:01:54,540
So that's why since we are using SAS in this class, I'm going to go with you over the basics of the SAS macros.

19
00:01:56,370 --> 00:02:03,059
So, so you know, at least how to run those and we will go even kind of like trying to do like a

20
00:02:03,060 --> 00:02:07,889
small macro yourself to kind of like see but that will be kind of like optional,

21
00:02:07,890 --> 00:02:14,630
so don't worry. So that will be part of the second part of the lab, but that's extra credit on optional, you know, how to it.

22
00:02:15,090 --> 00:02:18,690
And then the lab will be embedded and as we move on.

23
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:26,880
Okay, so I think you already saw that. So there are two ways of classifying error.

24
00:02:27,930 --> 00:02:32,130
One is can be either random or systematic right.

25
00:02:33,630 --> 00:02:36,690
Or can be between person and within person. Right.

26
00:02:37,020 --> 00:02:44,250
So we already saw that. And because we have those two classifications, in the end we will end up with four types of error.

27
00:02:44,670 --> 00:02:51,360
Random with impersonal. Random with impersonal. Systematic between person random and between person systematic.

28
00:02:52,530 --> 00:03:02,360
And then and this is coming from the third, will it work? So then if you with impersonal random is the one that be kind of like trying to get rid of,

29
00:03:02,370 --> 00:03:05,970
remember that with impersonal variation we are assuming that is is error.

30
00:03:06,340 --> 00:03:12,920
Remember I've been telling you that it's actually not error because it's real day to day variation, right?

31
00:03:12,930 --> 00:03:16,170
Because many people don't eat the same things every day.

32
00:03:16,410 --> 00:03:20,889
But we are considering it and statistical point of view is better to consider like errors.

33
00:03:20,890 --> 00:03:25,970
So then we can get rid of that, right? So because this actually introducing noise, right?

34
00:03:25,990 --> 00:03:27,380
I mean, we don't want to kind of lie.

35
00:03:27,390 --> 00:03:33,900
I mean, we don't care about those fluctuations where we getting some kind of like what is the average long term impact, right?

36
00:03:34,950 --> 00:03:38,849
So so this is the plus.

37
00:03:38,850 --> 00:03:45,270
I mean, it's true that some of it maybe real day to day variation, but some of it may be also errors in measurement.

38
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:51,959
So this is still kind of like there, we think for somebody who has both has a real component, but also a true error component.

39
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:57,120
Right. Anyway, you already know how to kind of like get rid of that in a way.

40
00:03:58,530 --> 00:04:08,579
Now, the other type of error that is more complicated and this is actually this is true bias by because it is basically bias in any

41
00:04:08,580 --> 00:04:16,440
estimate is that we think person systematic right and that happens like if you think about a people when they are kind of

42
00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:27,870
like reporting their intake it is very difficult to report for and they we know so it happens all the time that people either

43
00:04:27,870 --> 00:04:33,870
deny or exaggerate food intake and then can be consciously or unconsciously most of the time is actually unconsciously.

44
00:04:33,900 --> 00:04:39,690
Right. Because it is not that people really want to lie or really want to tell you kind of like, no, I'm I mean, it's true that that is.

45
00:04:39,690 --> 00:04:45,120
And so she really devised the sentence when you kind of like use these questionnaires that are online.

46
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:48,570
I mean, there's not so much social this really difficult. Everything is anonymous, right?

47
00:04:48,810 --> 00:04:55,520
So so people tend to kind of like overestimate the consumption of certain foods or the other way around, right?

48
00:04:55,800 --> 00:05:03,330
So that will be like with in person systematic. And then if we move to the between person.

49
00:05:04,440 --> 00:05:06,929
You can have it in person at random. Right.

50
00:05:06,930 --> 00:05:17,390
And this is this happens particularly when you have only a few replica measurements of only 1% beard and both have random with impression level.

51
00:05:17,410 --> 00:05:20,550
So that translates into be 10% random, right?

52
00:05:20,760 --> 00:05:23,310
So kind of like amplifies into the 18% random.

53
00:05:23,940 --> 00:05:32,400
And finally you have that between person systematic and again also results from systematic within person error that affects subject no randomly.

54
00:05:32,430 --> 00:05:42,239
Right. So if if that systematic error that people have within within person was random, then it will compensate in a way.

55
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:45,899
And then you will have the 10% systematic but with impersonal random.

56
00:05:45,900 --> 00:05:53,910
Right. But because usually that's not the case, usually that that's enough that just randomly then you end up with 10% systematic.

57
00:05:54,990 --> 00:05:59,370
Okay. So those are the kind of like four types of error.

58
00:05:59,370 --> 00:06:07,139
And one of the most important I can like take home messages and bottom line of today is that random

59
00:06:07,140 --> 00:06:13,200
within personable can be measured with a single measure and get rid of with a single replicate measure.

60
00:06:13,860 --> 00:06:19,019
As long as you have two measures, you know, you can decompose the variance and get rid of that.

61
00:06:19,020 --> 00:06:23,190
With impersonal ratio. You only need replicate at least one more replicate.

62
00:06:23,430 --> 00:06:32,430
You have more data, right, but only one more. But systematic error requires a separate calibration study.

63
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:40,720
So there's no other way that you can kind of like go right for systematic error if you don't have like a kind of like like a gold standard in no way.

64
00:06:40,740 --> 00:06:47,850
Right, that you measure the true in there with something else and then you calibrate your your tool,

65
00:06:47,910 --> 00:06:51,060
the one that you're using that you feel that has systematically.

66
00:06:52,140 --> 00:06:56,280
So remember random you only need replicate systematic.

67
00:06:56,460 --> 00:07:03,100
You don't need a calibration to study. Okay.

68
00:07:03,190 --> 00:07:12,429
So we already knew that, right? We already corrected for the standard deviation from the member and we already know that the standard

69
00:07:12,430 --> 00:07:17,600
deviation of the distribution is going to be saturated in the presence of random within partial variation.

70
00:07:17,610 --> 00:07:22,360
But remember that it will be kind of much wider when we correct for that.

71
00:07:22,360 --> 00:07:24,339
It will be kind of like more narrower.

72
00:07:24,340 --> 00:07:31,030
So then we won't be misclassifying people when we consider that people have a certain kind of life threshold, right?

73
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:37,170
That what our number one looks like a long time ago and a few weeks ago.

74
00:07:37,180 --> 00:07:44,770
Right. And remember, this is this is where you see it kind of like that, because everywhere you look, the idea that when you are sampling,

75
00:07:45,640 --> 00:07:54,460
when you have many measures, then you're kind of like observe, not really take kind of like tends to work through integrator.

76
00:07:54,820 --> 00:07:57,729
The distribution would be narrower, but as you start sampling,

77
00:07:57,730 --> 00:08:05,200
then you probably have more kind of like sampling of extreme values in people and then you will end up with wider distributions, right?

78
00:08:08,270 --> 00:08:17,360
Okay. And the way to kind of like for that is to get at least one more replica measure and then you do one and another and then

79
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:22,990
basically you get rid of that with impersonal violence and you only kind of like keep the between person personal ideas,

80
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:26,569
which is the one you're interested in. Right. Okay.

81
00:08:26,570 --> 00:08:32,000
And this is how we should remember. These are the two things that we have.

82
00:08:32,510 --> 00:08:38,930
And then this. And that was kind of like, remember that protein question that you were using?

83
00:08:38,930 --> 00:08:40,850
Then apply the service you share.

84
00:08:40,850 --> 00:08:48,229
You will have like many people who is deficient by the ones you read and you go through kind of like, what are you supposed to do that solution?

85
00:08:48,230 --> 00:08:51,469
Then you will see that we can do some kind of like this one.

86
00:08:51,470 --> 00:08:56,900
And again, many more and many less people, and at least you're going to see less people.

87
00:08:58,430 --> 00:09:04,150
And below that kind of low threshold of efficiency, which has enormous implications for probably have.

88
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:10,190
Right. Because I mean where you are measuring these are the population level in nationally representative samples.

89
00:09:10,550 --> 00:09:15,110
You want to get a good estimate of the percentage of people who need intervention.

90
00:09:15,110 --> 00:09:18,530
Right. And it's not the same to have 20% that have 2%.

91
00:09:18,680 --> 00:09:22,010
Right. Okay.

92
00:09:22,070 --> 00:09:26,510
So now so far so good. We already know that.

93
00:09:26,630 --> 00:09:31,070
Right? So now press and now we start with in your face.

94
00:09:31,220 --> 00:09:38,280
Okay. Okay. So now we are going to go read epidemiologic epidemiological measures of association for measurement error.

95
00:09:38,330 --> 00:09:44,420
We are going to correct the correlation coefficient and in a way you have already hear about those.

96
00:09:44,510 --> 00:09:52,040
Remember that the attenuated correlation coefficients that we saw in the paper that was validated in the three,

97
00:09:52,040 --> 00:09:54,500
I mean, checking the three four frequency questionnaires they were using,

98
00:09:54,920 --> 00:09:58,400
remember the attenuated correlation coefficient that we are already kind of like

99
00:09:58,670 --> 00:10:03,649
getting rid of that with impersonal variation in their correlation coefficients.

100
00:10:03,650 --> 00:10:08,300
At that point we didn't know how to do that, but we understood what they were doing right.

101
00:10:08,540 --> 00:10:11,780
So now we are going to learn how to do that actually is not how big.

102
00:10:11,990 --> 00:10:13,340
This is one of the easy ones.

103
00:10:14,360 --> 00:10:21,409
Then we're going to go red resolution comparisons with this, you know, correlation coefficient, subrogation coefficients of legacies.

104
00:10:21,410 --> 00:10:27,440
Right. So they are going to lie very similar, right? So is actually very similar formula from one to the other.

105
00:10:28,430 --> 00:10:32,360
And they want to kind of they know how to correct risk.

106
00:10:32,810 --> 00:10:41,300
And for these three things, remember that one thing is correct in random error and one thing is correcting systematic error.

107
00:10:41,540 --> 00:10:47,900
So don't get confused because I will be kind of like mixing all of them. I will tell you when this systematic one is random, so one is random.

108
00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:51,889
Again, you only need replicate, you only need another one is systematic.

109
00:10:51,890 --> 00:10:57,350
You will need that calibration study and it will be like a more like a two stage approach.

110
00:10:57,560 --> 00:11:06,680
Okay. Okay. So condition of correlation coefficient and this is this is random within person variance.

111
00:11:06,740 --> 00:11:12,320
So assuming that both variables that you have are subject to random with impression error.

112
00:11:12,890 --> 00:11:16,250
So you can, you can correct actually both of them, right.

113
00:11:16,580 --> 00:11:23,270
So then you're true. I mean, true corrected correlation coefficient is going to be the fair one,

114
00:11:23,270 --> 00:11:32,930
the one that you do normally multiply it by this factor and this factor has one parameter that you may not remember.

115
00:11:34,580 --> 00:11:42,770
I'm actually we call it that way when we buy this parameter they were calling here random essentially our old friend we

116
00:11:42,770 --> 00:11:49,700
think person variation ratio so land that is that we think there's some variation over there between person variation.

117
00:11:49,730 --> 00:11:51,770
This is what we did for homework number one.

118
00:11:52,100 --> 00:11:58,760
Remember we were the competition, the variance we were using the analysis of variance and then we were getting for the ANOVA table,

119
00:11:58,850 --> 00:12:04,570
we were getting the within person variation and we were getting the between based on variation between some idea.

120
00:12:04,580 --> 00:12:09,860
And then we were doing our ratio and then that ratio is going to be a problem.

121
00:12:10,250 --> 00:12:18,920
Okay. Now more than that to land us because we are assuming that both variables that were correlated have random error.

122
00:12:19,340 --> 00:12:23,630
So you will have a number for one body and then that for building model.

123
00:12:24,260 --> 00:12:27,290
And this end is the number of radicals.

124
00:12:28,070 --> 00:12:31,729
That is the better because you have most of it.

125
00:12:31,730 --> 00:12:37,400
I mean for the whole we are doing it will be two because we will only have two, but it could be three or four.

126
00:12:37,460 --> 00:12:41,990
Right. Yeah. And X is one binomial right is the other way.

127
00:12:42,230 --> 00:12:46,790
Right. So it's kind of like just applying a relatively simple formula.

128
00:12:47,150 --> 00:12:56,080
So the only trick here is that you have to get that number from your ANOVA table, which you already did before, you know.

129
00:12:58,310 --> 00:13:06,890
Now, if only it's possible that only one variable is subject to random error and the other is not, in that case, basically the formula.

130
00:13:06,980 --> 00:13:17,870
Gets simplified, right? So just gradually this clutter will disappear and you already get one right.

131
00:13:18,170 --> 00:13:30,560
But the meaning of the parameters is the same number of in person, the variation of in this operating ratio and is the number of replicates.

132
00:13:31,160 --> 00:13:38,120
And of course, even when kind of like when you have random error,

133
00:13:38,780 --> 00:13:45,290
one of the assumptions to use this method is that the variation in X and Y is independent, right?

134
00:13:45,290 --> 00:13:49,070
Because if it's not independent, then maybe you are not really correct in that way, right?

135
00:13:52,540 --> 00:13:56,110
Okay. And this is one example, but he's using actually this simple formula.

136
00:13:56,530 --> 00:14:03,519
So this is this is kind of like correcting correction coefficients.

137
00:14:03,520 --> 00:14:10,239
But you will see that just by just correcting doesn't mean that you're going to get wonderful kind of like corrections.

138
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:15,610
And the idea is that not all corrections have the same attitude because there is I mean,

139
00:14:15,610 --> 00:14:20,950
the impact of within seen person variation ratio unobtrusively on those corrections is very important.

140
00:14:21,310 --> 00:14:27,760
So this table is kind of like a little horrible to see, but let me kind of like guide you.

141
00:14:28,300 --> 00:14:31,420
So we have I mean, let me show you here.

142
00:14:31,990 --> 00:14:35,500
So we have basically two nutrients.

143
00:14:35,500 --> 00:14:40,810
We have sucrose and we have cholesterol. So then we can compare two different situations.

144
00:14:40,930 --> 00:14:41,230
Right.

145
00:14:41,740 --> 00:14:55,870
And then these are kind of like this is the the kind of like data from the diet or intake and this is the correlations with the dietary questionnaire.

146
00:14:55,870 --> 00:14:59,980
So we will have the observe correlation here. And this is the corrected correlation.

147
00:15:00,070 --> 00:15:05,440
Okay. And it has is a correlation with the confidence that this is standard error in the correlation.

148
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:07,030
The one with the correlation is this. Right?

149
00:15:07,660 --> 00:15:17,980
And then note that they what they hear is that they want to see the impact of that within between somebody and the reproducibility.

150
00:15:18,130 --> 00:15:21,610
Right. And that opportunity is measured by this indirect correlation.

151
00:15:21,610 --> 00:15:28,360
So before I continue explaining the table, let me remind you what I didn't write.

152
00:15:28,360 --> 00:15:33,549
Last correlation coefficient is the you know what I mean. Track less correlation coefficient there's no.

153
00:15:33,550 --> 00:15:37,930
Have you heard of it before. Doesn't even remember.

154
00:15:38,610 --> 00:15:42,130
Okay. So that's why it is like this here.

155
00:15:42,760 --> 00:15:48,900
Okay. So the intra classical review coefficient, basically what measures is reliability and reproducibility, right?

156
00:15:49,690 --> 00:15:55,210
Both things are more or less the same. So is there a correlation between two replicates from the same subject?

157
00:15:55,480 --> 00:16:02,080
So the idea that someone is telling you something and then one week later is telling you something about the same thing,

158
00:16:02,080 --> 00:16:07,330
you're expecting the high correlation, right? Because I mean, otherwise, if you have low correlation,

159
00:16:07,330 --> 00:16:12,550
then you start kind of like doubting that asking people is a good way of measuring that thing, right?

160
00:16:13,420 --> 00:16:17,799
So that's something that you do a lot with any tool you use for measure.

161
00:16:17,800 --> 00:16:20,680
I mean, from diet to questionnaire to anything,

162
00:16:20,680 --> 00:16:27,459
even even measures in the lab also do that indirect correlation coefficient in a way to show reproducibility, right?

163
00:16:27,460 --> 00:16:30,220
So they just want to make sure that the reproducibility is right.

164
00:16:30,610 --> 00:16:39,939
Now in addition, epi, not everything has the same reproducibility and I think I already kind of like told you before,

165
00:16:39,940 --> 00:16:48,429
like for example, depending on the I mean some food intake has reported, food intake has higher reproducibility than others.

166
00:16:48,430 --> 00:16:54,630
Like for example, one that I always tell you that has high reproducibility is coffee intake, right?

167
00:16:54,640 --> 00:16:56,500
Because coffee intake is like a habit.

168
00:16:56,500 --> 00:17:02,110
So then people will tell you, oh yeah, I have like three cups of coffee a day and then a month from now they will tell you,

169
00:17:02,110 --> 00:17:05,200
oh yeah, I have three cups of coffee. Right. Maybe four. Right.

170
00:17:05,200 --> 00:17:07,719
But it doesn't kind of like change that much.

171
00:17:07,720 --> 00:17:12,100
It's not that suddenly that, yo, I don't drink any of you and they're kind of like in two months they will tell you,

172
00:17:12,190 --> 00:17:15,339
Yeah, that, that of coffee unless they change the habit.

173
00:17:15,340 --> 00:17:19,480
But that's not the usual thing, right? So usually that thing has had a pretty good approachability.

174
00:17:19,780 --> 00:17:24,159
While other things may have a lower approachability, which things like beans,

175
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:30,060
for example, that you eat outside, I mean, probably have lower verbal civility, right?

176
00:17:30,070 --> 00:17:32,210
Because, I mean, you don't really know what you're eating, basically.

177
00:17:32,740 --> 00:17:39,370
So most of the time, I mean, when you prepare your food, you know, what you are eating when you eat outside sometimes is more difficult.

178
00:17:39,370 --> 00:17:47,139
Right. Anyway, so, so that's the formula for that for me in that escalation coefficient.

179
00:17:47,140 --> 00:17:51,730
And then you can see that actually is built with things that we are really familiar with.

180
00:17:51,850 --> 00:17:57,940
So this is that this is a bit in question like I really did this in a we think version by way of basically

181
00:17:57,940 --> 00:18:03,040
the way that this is measured is that we compare somebody individually divided by the sum of the two,

182
00:18:03,100 --> 00:18:09,220
right? So and those are coming from your ANOVA, right?

183
00:18:09,580 --> 00:18:16,300
So they really are the higher that role, the higher that intra the coffee, the higher the reproducibility, right.

184
00:18:16,750 --> 00:18:30,070
So then now that you know this, we can go back to the table and you can see that sucrose have much higher intra class correlation than cholesterol,

185
00:18:30,220 --> 00:18:39,670
which is telling you that foods that have sucrose probably are better remember than foods that have cholesterol.

186
00:18:39,910 --> 00:18:49,560
Right. So. So this is what I kind of like added here.

187
00:18:49,570 --> 00:18:58,450
So this is low within between and high reproducibility because the other thing is that we are comparing the within and between.

188
00:18:58,450 --> 00:19:07,269
So you can see that kind of like this is high and it is high within between a ratio and low reproducibility.

189
00:19:07,270 --> 00:19:12,370
So then you have to to notice here the have very different situation in terms of

190
00:19:12,370 --> 00:19:21,010
how that ratio of the between within between variation and the in the official is.

191
00:19:21,460 --> 00:19:30,910
So when that happen and I hear you why you have like four kind of like lines is because they are kind of like also sampling day.

192
00:19:30,920 --> 00:19:32,420
So they are kind of like seeing you.

193
00:19:32,500 --> 00:19:42,370
You only take two days then of course kind of like this is this is this is kind of I mean, this is not that different, right?

194
00:19:42,370 --> 00:19:49,029
But that kind of like you get the 28 days and then this distance change ratio,

195
00:19:49,030 --> 00:19:57,730
they'd be doing partial radiation kind of like gross was higher and they kind of like the the within awesome.

196
00:19:58,240 --> 00:20:00,160
So so in any case,

197
00:20:01,360 --> 00:20:12,459
the bottom line here after trying to screen all the components of the of the table is that when you have kind of like this is there's a correlation.

198
00:20:12,460 --> 00:20:20,710
So you can see that is kind of like more or less and is not that different here, but is high for sucrose than for cholesterol,

199
00:20:20,710 --> 00:20:27,420
which makes sense because, I mean, the the the it has more kind of like higher approachability and also low, we think great.

200
00:20:27,910 --> 00:20:36,490
But when you go read basically you can see that the correction that you do, even though it goes higher,

201
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:43,569
doesn't really go that higher as opposed to when when you go read kind of like this thing in cholesterol.

202
00:20:43,570 --> 00:20:50,740
So you can see that that cholesterol going from only having to this the correlation is very, very low.

203
00:20:51,070 --> 00:20:58,150
So you really need to have many ways to kind of like have a high correlation, right?

204
00:20:58,900 --> 00:21:07,720
But when you have to base and you are able to correct, you almost get the same correlation that you would get from 24, 28 days.

205
00:21:08,260 --> 00:21:12,190
And this does not happen with the sucrose.

206
00:21:12,190 --> 00:21:18,309
Right? So you can see that that having 28, 20 base actually, I mean, kind of like, yeah,

207
00:21:18,310 --> 00:21:25,720
you increase actually increase even above what is supposed to be the truth, which would be reached, but it doesn't affect that much.

208
00:21:25,750 --> 00:21:35,140
Right? So bottom line, depending on the nutrient declarations will be kind of like more efficient than than than others.

209
00:21:35,170 --> 00:21:42,550
Yes. It's considered like a in your class correlation that represents high possibility.

210
00:21:44,220 --> 00:21:52,240
And I'm sorry, I have considered intra class correlation coefficient that indicates high reproducibility.

211
00:21:52,510 --> 00:22:02,709
Oh well yeah that's I know because in addition bit you may not find I like, I mean in theory the indirect in social bonding that one.

212
00:22:02,710 --> 00:22:09,250
So the closer to two one the higher. But I think values like this are probably higher.

213
00:22:09,400 --> 00:22:13,620
Maybe they can be a little higher. But really, I mean, it's more like a relative comparison.

214
00:22:13,630 --> 00:22:18,610
I mean, that there's one or the other. Yeah, that's a good question because something would have higher.

215
00:22:20,020 --> 00:22:25,690
So anyway, so you can see that for something like cholesterol when you only have two days because

216
00:22:25,690 --> 00:22:34,590
usually remember that you rarely have the luxury of having 28 days of dietary class.

217
00:22:34,600 --> 00:22:38,770
Right, because that's everybody especially. So usually you have to kind of like sample just get like two.

218
00:22:39,100 --> 00:22:45,790
So when you have to then basically your correlation coefficient ratio is going to be really low because in this

219
00:22:45,790 --> 00:22:50,440
situation we have it has a very low intra class correlation and then the high we think we do doing right.

220
00:22:51,880 --> 00:22:58,240
But if in this situation you are able you are still able to go red, which you will be could have leave,

221
00:22:58,240 --> 00:23:05,889
you have to then your correlation coefficient will go into something which is much closer to what is supposed to be the true correlation.

222
00:23:05,890 --> 00:23:11,620
Right. So this is I mean, for cholesterol is really worth it for sucrose is not that worth it?

223
00:23:11,620 --> 00:23:16,150
Right. So then that's why I mean in this question is very good like in the sense that

224
00:23:16,360 --> 00:23:19,870
what we can see that high in direct correlation that we go right or not.

225
00:23:20,050 --> 00:23:23,980
I mean if you that you will correct all of them you can correct. Because it's always better.

226
00:23:23,980 --> 00:23:31,150
Right. So anyway and this is remember, this is how we are doing.

227
00:23:31,150 --> 00:23:36,660
So then kind of like going back to how we how do we go read this, we apply this formula.

228
00:23:36,670 --> 00:23:42,610
So what they are doing. So I. Okay.

229
00:23:45,030 --> 00:23:50,460
So you look at this going from this point 52 by 68, how do they arrive to that?

230
00:23:50,850 --> 00:23:55,370
So they they were using these 761 and these for 40.

231
00:23:55,380 --> 00:24:04,380
So that's what they were doing is this is the land that is there within versus we doing ratio to is

232
00:24:04,380 --> 00:24:10,890
because you have to this right and then if you apply this factor and square root 2.50 you get point 68.

233
00:24:10,980 --> 00:24:16,440
So that's how they got it. Now, getting the confidence intervals is a little more complicated.

234
00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:20,970
So. So you can see them here.

235
00:24:21,480 --> 00:24:24,750
The formula is still. Yes, I just apply that.

236
00:24:24,750 --> 00:24:29,520
I'm not asking you kind of like for for the confidence intervals,

237
00:24:29,520 --> 00:24:35,579
but the confidence intervals are important because they always are going to everything.

238
00:24:35,580 --> 00:24:44,100
Right. Because you will say, I mean, okay, if I can go right for measurement error, why should I call it more replicates, I call it only two.

239
00:24:44,100 --> 00:24:48,120
And then I will basically just go right and I will get almost the same as I have with doing it.

240
00:24:48,840 --> 00:24:52,950
Yes. What? You greatly decrease procedure.

241
00:24:53,310 --> 00:24:58,650
You only have two days. Your confidence interval is going to be much larger than the you have 28 days.

242
00:24:59,190 --> 00:25:05,100
Right. So that's that's kind of like the con, you know what I mean? So you compare that with feasibility and cost.

243
00:25:05,910 --> 00:25:15,060
It's better to only have two days, right? But kind of like the, the, the, the only drawback is that you decrease precision by having only two things.

244
00:25:17,350 --> 00:25:22,160
Okay. And this is kind of related to their to the considerations of the study, you say.

245
00:25:22,200 --> 00:25:26,370
So we want to think the more precise estimate of the true correlation,

246
00:25:26,370 --> 00:25:34,710
should we enroll many subjects and collect only a few replicates because we know that we can already kind of like correct.

247
00:25:34,860 --> 00:25:41,730
Even if we only have to replicate, we can go and we will get more or less the same, even though with some decreased position.

248
00:25:41,970 --> 00:25:50,860
So maybe it's better to have more subjects or is it better to involve a few subjects and collect more replicas for each person?

249
00:25:51,720 --> 00:26:12,590
So whether you think. You think there's a better world for your service in Colombia?

250
00:26:13,560 --> 00:26:16,900
Boy, I'm not sure you know.

251
00:26:18,460 --> 00:26:21,630
Actually, this is not an easy answer.

252
00:26:21,630 --> 00:26:26,850
So it depends. It depends. So there is no a clear answer that one or the other is better.

253
00:26:27,210 --> 00:26:31,050
And actually, there's a similar table that shows you that it depends.

254
00:26:31,050 --> 00:26:37,890
Kind of like also depending on the kind of like the the the variance of the.

255
00:26:38,130 --> 00:26:43,760
I mean, this is evidence of the corrected correlation coefficient multiplied by the total number of measurements over the entire sample.

256
00:26:43,770 --> 00:26:49,339
Right. So then the that I hear is the exact less correlation coefficient.

257
00:26:49,340 --> 00:27:00,470
So this is also kind of related to the fact that kind of like you have different reproducibility and different measures,

258
00:27:00,490 --> 00:27:04,170
then you can see kind of like the numbers change, but the numbers don't change.

259
00:27:04,170 --> 00:27:10,229
Kind of like always showing that it's better to have less people and more replication

260
00:27:10,230 --> 00:27:14,400
is better always to have more replication and less replication more people.

261
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:24,740
Right. So it will depend on on on average, you can see that actually you tend to prefer to have more people and less replicates.

262
00:27:26,100 --> 00:27:31,259
But it depends. I mean, sometimes you may not find kind of like that.

263
00:27:31,260 --> 00:27:35,580
That's the more precise way of doing things. Okay.

264
00:27:35,790 --> 00:27:41,240
Any question on that? Oh, so now.

265
00:27:41,390 --> 00:27:45,530
So that was for correcting correlation coefficients,

266
00:27:45,530 --> 00:27:53,209
which what I really want you to remember is just that you're reducing the formula that you're using and using that we see in between and understanding

267
00:27:53,210 --> 00:27:58,940
that the correction is going to be better depending on certain conditions that

268
00:27:58,940 --> 00:28:02,390
are related to the reproducibility and that with in between to somebody.

269
00:28:02,750 --> 00:28:11,840
Okay. So that's the only. Now, if we move on to correcting regression coefficients and again, this is for random with with.

270
00:28:13,310 --> 00:28:19,010
So this is a similar situation that are correlation coefficient because correlation coefficients on and the better,

271
00:28:19,300 --> 00:28:21,350
the linear regression are very similar, right?

272
00:28:21,770 --> 00:28:29,059
So, so one thing is that in linear regression, the dependent variable, even if it has kind of like random error,

273
00:28:29,060 --> 00:28:32,880
the revision coefficient is not going to be attenuated, so you don't really need to it.

274
00:28:35,840 --> 00:28:43,760
Position will be reduced for sure. You have error, but the the point estimate is not going to be attenuated.

275
00:28:43,760 --> 00:28:51,080
So then there's not that huge need of correct, but you definitely need to correct the independent variable and the conversion of

276
00:28:51,090 --> 00:28:55,370
independent whatever is what is exactly the same as the correlation coefficient.

277
00:28:55,790 --> 00:29:09,170
But what I mean is that 11 which I don't know if she understood because anyway, so it's exactly the same as the correlation coefficient,

278
00:29:09,190 --> 00:29:13,700
but we felt that if you had your will be corrected better,

279
00:29:13,880 --> 00:29:18,860
this would be your observer and this is the lambda that we had before, if you really like it.

280
00:29:18,980 --> 00:29:21,990
Right. So you don't have to acknowledge this point. Right.

281
00:29:22,360 --> 00:29:27,680
But it's exactly the same. Oh, so basically.

282
00:29:28,310 --> 00:29:34,850
So now let's move in to the lab and we are going to do this together.

283
00:29:34,850 --> 00:29:41,659
Okay. So then the question one is that we are going to do the correction of correlation coefficients for random measurement error.

284
00:29:41,660 --> 00:29:41,990
Right?

285
00:29:42,440 --> 00:29:52,700
And then this is this is going to be mostly hand calculations, but we can do something in SAS to to kind of remind you how we got that information.

286
00:29:53,660 --> 00:30:00,229
So, so that was this is the observed correlation between they mean of two days surveys from day

287
00:30:00,230 --> 00:30:05,290
of like of amendment and F Q and the various components ratio for cholesterol and vitamin,

288
00:30:05,290 --> 00:30:10,220
they are listed below. So you have here to notice you have cholesterol and you have vitamin D, right?

289
00:30:10,460 --> 00:30:16,070
And this is your circulation for questionnaires, point 21 and four, vitamin D is by 13.

290
00:30:16,850 --> 00:30:23,720
And then I'm giving you already the the the lambda this is number, right?

291
00:30:24,260 --> 00:30:30,590
So this is the basically the within versus between ratio is 9.5 for cholesterol and 6.3 for vitamin.

292
00:30:31,250 --> 00:30:35,510
And then I'm asking you to calculate the correlated correlation coefficient.

293
00:30:35,930 --> 00:30:41,659
So you just need to apply this formula and compare them with the observed correlation between the

294
00:30:41,660 --> 00:30:46,880
first negative percent and the main of the 28 they would record you did for hunger number one.

295
00:30:48,110 --> 00:30:52,729
So now if you don't remember mean you can go back to the recognition coefficients.

296
00:30:52,730 --> 00:31:01,130
If you don't remember, you can always let me show you because I've changed that in the you can use this.

297
00:31:01,310 --> 00:31:08,660
Okay. So oh okay. So for Cholesterols point 61 for vitamin K split into 24.

298
00:31:08,930 --> 00:31:14,210
So remember that clearly when you have many more, they do a correlation coefficient, you get higher, right?

299
00:31:14,600 --> 00:31:19,160
So in theory you should have something like that in the you can use this.

300
00:31:19,610 --> 00:31:23,390
So the idea is that let me show you.

301
00:31:26,680 --> 00:31:32,720
He says. You don't have to do this because you already knew this.

302
00:31:32,960 --> 00:31:40,490
So remember, we went to show you a four protein work, which we are not using protein here.

303
00:31:40,520 --> 00:31:43,760
Okay. So this is an example you'll have to do for cholesterol known by the Mini.

304
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:47,930
But originally we are using this in the research which we also work with protein.

305
00:31:48,350 --> 00:31:51,920
So remember we were running this and all the.

306
00:31:57,590 --> 00:32:06,950
And this is the table that we were looking for. Right. And remember, this was the within person variation for 51.

307
00:32:07,160 --> 00:32:16,220
And then from this one, with the model with which is 66, 61, we were getting there between this way.

308
00:32:16,250 --> 00:32:24,590
Right. Remember, we were kind of like getting this 661 minus the we thing divided by two and then that would get there between.

309
00:32:24,620 --> 00:32:31,070
So then the between is one of four. And then within this conflict, the want them directly from the table.

310
00:32:31,430 --> 00:32:37,100
And then when you do this ratio, you get four points of do want to remember we were having it for 15.

311
00:32:37,520 --> 00:32:40,980
Do you remember that number. So this is a random.

312
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:46,210
Right. So then basically I mean not that I'm not doing anything with says I'm just kind of running the ANOVA.

313
00:32:46,420 --> 00:32:51,080
Now you don't have to now because I'm already giving you this lambdas.

314
00:32:51,800 --> 00:32:55,020
I'm already giving you these numbers here. Okay.

315
00:32:55,040 --> 00:33:00,589
So you don't have to run them, right? But I want to do this with you.

316
00:33:00,590 --> 00:33:05,630
So do remember that these are coming from someone, right? That I'm kind of, like, just making that up.

317
00:33:06,290 --> 00:33:17,570
So. So now if if you know, there's a correlation between two data records and if you for protein was by training I did that right.

318
00:33:18,050 --> 00:33:22,670
And the circle relation with 28 they had their records and the 50 was point 57.

319
00:33:22,790 --> 00:33:26,089
And that should come from your homework, number one. And this is protein.

320
00:33:26,090 --> 00:33:29,600
So you have to do this. This is just an example. So then basically.

321
00:33:34,570 --> 00:33:37,650
If you can do it again, if you want.

322
00:33:37,660 --> 00:33:42,430
That's what I did here. But I'm never going to do it again. So that's how we do the correlations, right?

323
00:33:43,270 --> 00:33:54,280
But now when we go red my of circle relation which is point to any you see my on this is the stakes are is 44431.

324
00:33:55,030 --> 00:34:04,599
This is my correction then I get points 33 which you compare to the point 37, which was the true correlation, the one with the with 28.

325
00:34:04,600 --> 00:34:09,190
This is pretty good. So then basically my correction is working pretty well for Brodie.

326
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:14,769
Okay. And going from point 22.33, which is much closer to 2.37,

327
00:34:14,770 --> 00:34:20,890
which was supposed to be the true correlation because of that the 20 base using kind of like the gold standard.

328
00:34:22,090 --> 00:34:28,600
So now again, for this question, you don't have to do anything with SAS.

329
00:34:28,600 --> 00:34:33,790
I'm just kind of like showing you the steps that we did before to get all this

330
00:34:33,790 --> 00:34:39,730
kind of like an information that we need to calculate are correctly correlations,

331
00:34:40,360 --> 00:34:53,920
but then you can kind of like go back and then use now these to do cholesterol and vitamin A when you're doing okay.

332
00:34:54,490 --> 00:34:57,129
And then you will have to answer this question on your own,

333
00:34:57,130 --> 00:35:05,290
which is discuss briefly the advantages and disadvantages of using two days versus 28 days in the context of the corrected correlations,

334
00:35:05,650 --> 00:35:07,540
which I already told you no. Right.

335
00:35:08,020 --> 00:35:21,010
So then now you can kind of like work in pairs for, for a few minutes to calculate that on an on your own and let me know.

336
00:35:21,340 --> 00:35:24,620
And then once you are done, we will take a break. Okay.

337
00:35:24,790 --> 00:35:53,260
And then we will move to the next thing. If.

338
00:35:58,610 --> 00:36:28,480
Right now. Oh.

339
00:37:57,320 --> 00:38:14,530
Why? You know.

340
00:44:18,790 --> 00:45:31,510
She? We?

341
00:47:44,160 --> 00:47:53,730
Okay, sir, the example for question one, and here are just three points where that was a mistake.

342
00:47:53,760 --> 00:47:55,260
That's four, four, four, four, three, one.

343
00:47:55,260 --> 00:48:10,530
Here, you take the place and I know that I did the right run does that shows that here is the wasI in the bid to present variation.

344
00:48:10,920 --> 00:48:15,090
But why did you have to do that for someone?

345
00:48:15,510 --> 00:48:18,629
So I show you I show you these proteins.

346
00:48:18,630 --> 00:48:21,660
So then you see what I'm getting cannot lie there.

347
00:48:21,720 --> 00:48:28,050
But actually for this question one here and he says you just can do calculations and then go back to your.

348
00:48:28,270 --> 00:48:33,000
Yeah, yes. So you have everything you need because you have this you have this is your offset.

349
00:48:33,330 --> 00:48:42,670
So this is a really a setting. And then you have to go back and get the correlation coefficient that you got from your program.

350
00:48:42,670 --> 00:48:45,960
But when or if you cannot find it, then don't use these to.

351
00:49:02,480 --> 00:49:06,520
Why are you more a race? More or less than.

352
00:49:06,790 --> 00:49:10,630
Then we can take a five minute break and then we'll listen.

353
00:49:10,790 --> 00:49:52,020
Okay. And it just doesn't make sense to.

354
00:50:04,100 --> 00:50:11,280
I think it's just one.

355
00:50:12,100 --> 00:50:20,780
Just. Going to come up with.

356
00:50:26,480 --> 00:50:35,060
You put your. Home Depot.

357
00:50:36,680 --> 00:50:46,470
You're talking about individual accumulation of.

358
00:51:01,250 --> 00:51:13,250
Have you got? Usually.

359
00:51:31,480 --> 00:51:35,840
On. Oh.

360
00:52:00,140 --> 00:52:25,560
I mean. How do you get them together?

361
00:52:27,360 --> 00:52:32,680
Oh, you mean.

362
00:52:36,510 --> 00:52:40,660
You did it. Okay.

363
00:52:42,330 --> 00:52:54,140
Did you take a break? Are you ready to move on?

364
00:52:55,640 --> 00:52:59,570
Okay. Okay. Okay. So.

365
00:53:02,780 --> 00:53:15,290
Okay. So now we know what we did was correct in correlation coefficient ratio coefficients for random error, right?

366
00:53:15,290 --> 00:53:17,629
And then the question actually was for correlation coefficient.

367
00:53:17,630 --> 00:53:23,420
So you saw that both correlation coefficient separation coefficients are very similar, right?

368
00:53:23,750 --> 00:53:31,850
So now we're going to move into correcting for systematic within button Eva and then we're going to do it in the regression coefficient.

369
00:53:31,880 --> 00:53:39,920
Right. So this is the one that I told you this you can do with one more replicate because we still have error, right?

370
00:53:40,340 --> 00:53:46,820
So you need a calibration study. So and this is a two step approach because you need the calibration history.

371
00:53:47,300 --> 00:53:53,090
So then the idea is that you need like a separate calibration study where you

372
00:53:53,090 --> 00:54:01,760
are measuring kind of like your tool and compare it with a gold standard,

373
00:54:01,910 --> 00:54:06,770
right? So then now you can apply the gold standard.

374
00:54:07,130 --> 00:54:09,200
You know that there are no gold standard in addition,

375
00:54:09,200 --> 00:54:15,710
but we will assume that the gold standard may be related to a different data recorder or something like that, or biomarker or whatever.

376
00:54:16,160 --> 00:54:22,549
And then we're going to consider that the true measure. So now the true measure is this on the surrogate measure,

377
00:54:22,550 --> 00:54:28,340
the surrogate measure is the one that you are using in your larger study that you know, the systematic error, right?

378
00:54:28,880 --> 00:54:37,490
So then by doing that and then basically you are assuming that this is linear regression and then you have a continuous measure like for example,

379
00:54:37,490 --> 00:54:39,830
cholesterol and one and cholesterol and the other.

380
00:54:40,190 --> 00:54:46,220
Then you're going to get kind of like like a linear regression equation, which is very you and it just will be there.

381
00:54:46,770 --> 00:54:52,840
So that don't know what your set of, right?

382
00:54:53,630 --> 00:55:02,020
That's right. So the reason for using data is because we want to call this location something that we recognize.

383
00:55:02,340 --> 00:55:09,770
But this is just that normally that addition. So once you do that, you have a ratio to remember Expedia group ratio.

384
00:55:09,890 --> 00:55:15,410
And this is your sort of measures that basically what you are doing is that.

385
00:55:20,880 --> 00:55:24,600
Show me that there is something like that. Right. So.

386
00:55:27,420 --> 00:55:32,120
Right. So this is the kind of like to mention.

387
00:55:32,130 --> 00:55:44,340
And these are just sort of information. Right. So by doing that, you are getting this kind of like in a way, you're getting that calibration factor.

388
00:55:44,500 --> 00:55:52,920
Right. Something that is going to cover it. Right. And that thing is the better for the generation that we're gonna.

389
00:55:53,490 --> 00:55:58,560
So you think that them. They do. They look kind of like offset.

390
00:55:59,640 --> 00:56:03,040
Kind of like that.

391
00:56:03,120 --> 00:56:07,590
They should appreciate the way they with their money. Do you actually get their take on it?

392
00:56:07,950 --> 00:56:11,050
Okay. No.

393
00:56:13,440 --> 00:56:18,990
Well, to kind of like give you an example, because otherwise you get like very kind of like abstract.

394
00:56:19,470 --> 00:56:26,550
So what I mean, I'm going to tell you, first thing was you get a better coefficient from the linear regression model that you want to correct.

395
00:56:26,720 --> 00:56:31,650
Like that's your beat up nut and you get to your beat up self.

396
00:56:31,950 --> 00:56:35,540
Right. Sorry. And you get you want to get your Truvada right?

397
00:56:36,060 --> 00:56:40,950
Now you need a correction factor. Right. And then you get that regression.

398
00:56:40,950 --> 00:56:44,770
The true measure, the first method on the surrogate measure, which is also linear regression.

399
00:56:44,790 --> 00:56:48,240
Okay. So the one that you're using in your model, right.

400
00:56:50,610 --> 00:56:58,530
This is the example. So basically you want to see the relationship between dietary cholesterol measure with a questionnaire onset on cholesterol.

401
00:56:58,920 --> 00:57:01,590
And then it happens that when you do that,

402
00:57:01,860 --> 00:57:08,189
you look at dietary cholesterol and cholesterol and cholesterol and the relationship is .06, which is really,

403
00:57:08,190 --> 00:57:14,339
really low right now for a separate calibration study where you measure that cholesterol

404
00:57:14,340 --> 00:57:18,330
with a large number of dietary records and that's supposed to be your gold standard.

405
00:57:18,870 --> 00:57:22,530
Then you get a gamma that is point five. Okay.

406
00:57:23,190 --> 00:57:30,300
And then now your corrective regression coefficient is going to be your original point of six divided by five,

407
00:57:30,570 --> 00:57:35,639
which is going to be pointless, which is not like a like low revision condition.

408
00:57:35,640 --> 00:57:40,140
But that's because we know that dietary cholesterol doesn't really change the name of cholesterol a lot,

409
00:57:40,410 --> 00:57:47,940
but at least you're kind of like correcting for that systematic error that may be in there, kind of like a few that you're using.

410
00:57:48,090 --> 00:57:54,210
Okay. So that's kind of like the way of correcting for systematic with impression.

411
00:57:55,680 --> 00:58:02,520
Okay. Now we're able to move into relative risks, right?

412
00:58:02,540 --> 00:58:10,109
I mean, you've seen the risk. This is kind of like a generic term that we don't like to use in epidemiology because, I mean,

413
00:58:10,110 --> 00:58:14,630
there are ratios, right ratio ratios that kind of like this will apply to all of them.

414
00:58:14,640 --> 00:58:20,100
So binary kind of like measures that measure binary variables, right?

415
00:58:20,970 --> 00:58:24,150
Like your odds ratios or your address ratios. Okay.

416
00:58:25,170 --> 00:58:36,989
So, so when you are kind of like running into this situation, you may have in your models,

417
00:58:36,990 --> 00:58:40,470
you may have categorical variables and you may have continued variables, right?

418
00:58:41,130 --> 00:58:43,770
So the categorical, categorical variables,

419
00:58:44,220 --> 00:58:51,720
the performance of your surrogate method can be described in terms of sensitivity and specificity, which are terms that you learned before.

420
00:58:51,720 --> 00:58:53,310
But we can review together.

421
00:58:54,060 --> 00:59:01,440
And for the continuous variables, you can still use your analysis of variance as before to calculate the true standard variation.

422
00:59:01,620 --> 00:59:09,390
So in that way, that will allow you to remove the kind of like loose impression from the with impersonal variation.

423
00:59:12,690 --> 00:59:17,950
Do you remember sensitivity and specificity? Yeah.

424
00:59:18,940 --> 00:59:23,160
Can you tell me what is the sensitivity and what is the specificity given that to the.

425
00:59:46,510 --> 00:59:50,550
Here's the portion of true positive.

426
00:59:52,510 --> 00:59:57,410
Disease pregnant and. Specificity is the.

427
01:00:00,870 --> 01:00:05,080
Yeah. You were going well. Yeah. Good for you, because I never remember.

428
01:00:05,160 --> 01:00:11,540
So I don't think. I never remember. No, because it is true that I always get confused.

429
01:00:11,560 --> 01:00:15,570
I guess it's a problem of life and, you know, left and right.

430
01:00:15,570 --> 01:00:24,390
Sorry that I also have that problem. So I always confused the specificity with the predicted positive value and the negative on your right.

431
01:00:24,840 --> 01:00:29,669
So. So because of that, actually, I let you know what it is.

432
01:00:29,670 --> 01:00:32,639
So then it's nice to to hear that you understand that.

433
01:00:32,640 --> 01:00:42,420
But I a long time ago I found this brief kind of like article that was using this visual approach to sensitivity and specificity.

434
01:00:42,420 --> 01:00:51,420
And I think and I found it very nice. So then I'm going to review you because then you can, you can see how like you can see the concept, right?

435
01:00:51,810 --> 01:01:04,350
So the symbols that this article uses is that the kind of like and the thought is a white person and and the black dot is a person with this is right.

436
01:01:04,800 --> 01:01:13,590
And then the other square, when the square is green, is a negative result and when the square is red is a positive result.

437
01:01:13,620 --> 01:01:18,120
So those are the four potential things that you have in your to do table, right?

438
01:01:18,120 --> 01:01:24,710
You have kind of like people with the disease, people with other disease, negative results or positive results, right?

439
01:01:24,720 --> 01:01:28,350
And then you have kind of like with a towards the table, you have all the possibilities, right?

440
01:01:28,650 --> 01:01:31,830
So then having all the possibilities have this great here.

441
01:01:32,220 --> 01:01:42,629
So they the Green Square with it and the dot will be a well first sample test negative which is a true negative.

442
01:01:42,630 --> 01:01:50,690
Right. How you should write the right kind of like a square with them where they are

443
01:01:50,700 --> 01:01:56,560
not will be a person with a disease who test positive which is a true right.

444
01:01:57,000 --> 01:02:00,960
So that's how it should be now where we check things.

445
01:02:01,020 --> 01:02:06,209
So this is the square on the empty antidote. Maybe, said one person who tests positive.

446
01:02:06,210 --> 01:02:12,900
So this is a false positive, right? And then where we have the green is well within that.

447
01:02:12,900 --> 01:02:16,280
But then we have a person with at least two tests negative.

448
01:02:16,290 --> 01:02:19,420
So this is a false negative. So we said the two that we don't want to have.

449
01:02:19,500 --> 01:02:28,319
Right. So then what this offers day is that they assume that this is your hypothetical population.

450
01:02:28,320 --> 01:02:34,850
So basically you have all the empty dots and while people are multiplied, those are the people this is.

451
01:02:34,860 --> 01:02:40,260
And then you can see if you can just dump these over a little time, you will get the progress of the disease.

452
01:02:41,640 --> 01:02:48,660
So then they put the colors, which is very nice, because now you can see that.

453
01:02:49,080 --> 01:02:54,950
Oh yeah, this part actually drew positives.

454
01:02:54,960 --> 01:02:59,970
Right. And this but actually two negatives.

455
01:02:59,970 --> 01:03:07,010
Right. But those are the ones who are kind of like, you know, the false positives and the false negatives.

456
01:03:07,020 --> 01:03:17,000
Right. So then the idea is that sensitivity to just go to the people who have the disease.

457
01:03:17,010 --> 01:03:24,069
So you take kind of like that. But and then in that part you have hopefully I'll be thought of positive.

458
01:03:24,070 --> 01:03:32,430
What do you have up a few who are who are negative.

459
01:03:32,430 --> 01:03:33,690
Right. False negatives.

460
01:03:34,020 --> 01:03:42,899
So sensitivity is how good at versus corrected if I people who have the disease by so then you just kind of like have to kind of like and be

461
01:03:42,900 --> 01:03:54,180
fighters you the you will see 24 out of the 30 people who have the disease so those 24 with the red kind of like it's worse over the 30.

462
01:03:54,870 --> 01:03:58,790
So that means that you have an 80% sensitivity, right?

463
01:03:58,800 --> 01:04:04,950
So just kind of like this this over this whole like.

464
01:04:08,150 --> 01:04:12,940
Well, when you look at the specificity, when you look at the other parts that you look at the best,

465
01:04:13,130 --> 01:04:18,400
I mean, specificity is how well the tests will come correctly when they find people who are with.

466
01:04:18,500 --> 01:04:27,920
Right. So then you look at the people who are well and then you count actually the the the green they bring back data,

467
01:04:27,920 --> 01:04:35,230
which in this case would be 56 over 70. So in this situation, the specificity will be 80% less so.

468
01:04:35,500 --> 01:04:41,360
So that was it sounded kind of like useful, maybe just a very silly thing that anyway.

469
01:04:41,870 --> 01:04:50,509
So now that you remember, what is sensitivity and specificity, then we're going to see how this is to do with the specificity,

470
01:04:50,510 --> 01:04:54,260
kind of like basically misclassify people from one place to the other.

471
01:04:54,260 --> 01:05:00,020
Right? So that's what that's what he's doing. Right? So so where we assume that this is the truth.

472
01:05:00,170 --> 01:05:05,530
Right. And of course, no one knows the truth. But this is kind of like there's an assumption.

473
01:05:05,540 --> 01:05:07,330
So you can see how things change. Right.

474
01:05:07,700 --> 01:05:13,940
So we are going to assume that we have said that this is this have there was this at this spot and these are the nasal.

475
01:05:14,600 --> 01:05:17,840
So we have 400 people here. It's under 200. And they had.

476
01:05:17,870 --> 01:05:23,389
Right. And then if you do kind of like an A ratio, you will get 2.67.

477
01:05:23,390 --> 01:05:25,490
So this will be like a true address here, right?

478
01:05:26,810 --> 01:05:38,420
Now, what happened is that the way that we that we have to classify people as this portion is both which maybe like a dietary tool,

479
01:05:38,420 --> 01:05:40,310
like for example that she's have to. Right.

480
01:05:40,640 --> 01:05:49,910
But kind of like people will be classified if they're exposed to I don't know it, I don't know tomatoes or not intermediate or whatever.

481
01:05:49,910 --> 01:05:55,530
Right. So is is not is not benefit by reason is never totally valid.

482
01:05:55,550 --> 01:06:05,730
Right. So. So then if we use this sensitivity and specificity values, we are assuming that is 60% sensitive.

483
01:06:05,750 --> 01:06:08,780
Sensitive and 90% is specific.

484
01:06:09,170 --> 01:06:17,160
Then what happened is that among these 400 I mean, some people are going to move cells.

485
01:06:17,300 --> 01:06:26,000
Right. And this same here, some people are going to move cells and the same amount they do within the disease and within their white people.

486
01:06:26,330 --> 01:06:32,459
So if you apply those those numbers, then you end up with this observe two by two table.

487
01:06:32,460 --> 01:06:40,530
Then now you have 300 people here, 200 people here, 708 hundred, which is kind of like different than what you had before.

488
01:06:40,550 --> 01:06:45,560
Right. And then when you do one ratio here, the observed ratio is 1.71,

489
01:06:46,250 --> 01:06:52,920
which is something that you already know that when you have this kind of like misclassification and this is random,

490
01:06:52,920 --> 01:06:56,270
this I mean, this is non differential misclassification, remember?

491
01:06:56,270 --> 01:07:01,220
So. So then that's going to attenuate your odds ratio.

492
01:07:02,060 --> 01:07:06,560
Right. So this is kind of like the the way of showing you what happened,

493
01:07:06,560 --> 01:07:11,660
where you know the truth and where you kind of like what what you will kind of like gossip.

494
01:07:11,960 --> 01:07:19,610
Now, knowing this, what you can do is what you are going to see in your life is this part.

495
01:07:19,700 --> 01:07:28,840
You don't know this, but if you know this, I mean, you see this part and you know this all that data that you may know from other studies.

496
01:07:28,910 --> 01:07:32,480
Right. Then you can go back to the to the truth.

497
01:07:32,600 --> 01:07:37,430
So that's that's the way that you will be correcting for that error and for that misclassification.

498
01:07:37,940 --> 01:07:43,130
So what you have to do now is this I mean, again, this is the truth and this is the offset.

499
01:07:43,610 --> 01:07:49,310
So then using the sensitivity and specificity, this is the way that you will get the truth right.

500
01:07:49,520 --> 01:07:52,890
This is the way that you will get that the people will correct it.

501
01:07:52,920 --> 01:08:03,110
And so A in Salvi and Soucy and Selby, they are using your ABC, the officer, and applying the kind of license of specificity in every in every place.

502
01:08:03,210 --> 01:08:08,480
Right. So I'm going through there how to derive this formula.

503
01:08:08,480 --> 01:08:11,870
But this is kind of like you could do it yourself and you can check and see.

504
01:08:11,870 --> 01:08:20,860
Oh, yeah. I mean, if I am assuming that you understand how these numbers are moving from one place to the other because of this.

505
01:08:20,870 --> 01:08:26,029
Right. You know, that some part will be kind of like false negative and have subpar will be false positives.

506
01:08:26,030 --> 01:08:29,660
And so they are going to kind of play more in into those details.

507
01:08:30,140 --> 01:08:36,450
So then you can kind of like come up with that family unit because we are not going to apply them for the lab.

508
01:08:36,450 --> 01:08:43,700
But for you to know for the future that you can use those formulas to correct those relative risks.

509
01:08:44,150 --> 01:08:47,110
Okay. Now, what is the problem?

510
01:08:47,120 --> 01:08:56,180
And this is when you have categorical variables, of course, what is the problem of and this is actually going back to the numbers that we have before.

511
01:08:56,660 --> 01:09:02,840
You can see that you can use these numbers and then you will get the real numbers.

512
01:09:03,180 --> 01:09:13,230
Now we are going backwards, right? Now, this this method has two very important limitations.

513
01:09:13,260 --> 01:09:19,530
One is that we have rarely interested in a single two way to table. Why do we need to control for other variables in the analysis?

514
01:09:20,160 --> 01:09:26,510
And there are no confidence limits either. We are only getting the corrected ratio, but we don't have the confidence and the confidence interval.

515
01:09:26,980 --> 01:09:35,620
Now, this method that is very simple has been extended to multidimensional tables and confidence intervals can be vibrated.

516
01:09:36,240 --> 01:09:39,270
Because this is one of those that are beyond the scope of the course.

517
01:09:39,630 --> 01:09:42,870
But the idea is that it can be extended to that.

518
01:09:42,870 --> 01:09:47,530
So the basically the place where it's coming from is what I'm explaining here.

519
01:09:47,550 --> 01:09:53,879
So you can see that in the future you need to use those methods that you can use those nice macros or

520
01:09:53,880 --> 01:10:00,000
macros or packages or whatever to calculate additional that is based on that kind of like sensitivity,

521
01:10:00,000 --> 01:10:03,270
specificity data. Okay. Okay.

522
01:10:03,270 --> 01:10:08,340
So thus thus for for the categorical.

523
01:10:09,420 --> 01:10:11,069
But when you have continuous,

524
01:10:11,070 --> 01:10:20,459
then you can actually I'm not going to spend a lot of time over here because this is this is in a way similar to what we have been doing before,

525
01:10:20,460 --> 01:10:24,300
but correcting the relative risk when you have continuous whatever.

526
01:10:24,330 --> 01:10:29,160
You can also use the the we are nova the composition right.

527
01:10:29,400 --> 01:10:34,700
And then you can get your beta version variation to kind of like correct for that.

528
01:10:34,710 --> 01:10:40,790
But this is I mean if you're interested in this part, then you can check that.

529
01:10:40,800 --> 01:10:45,480
Or when I spoke on the check that I put, but I'm not going into more details because this is just again,

530
01:10:45,780 --> 01:10:48,840
like I know that extension of what we've been doing before.

531
01:10:49,290 --> 01:10:56,190
What I really want to move on now is how to correct the relative risk for systematic with impressionism,

532
01:10:56,700 --> 01:10:59,780
because this is something that you will have to do in the in the lab. Right.

533
01:11:02,370 --> 01:11:10,590
So not that we are in the same situation that I explained before, before I already kind of like introduce way for visual coefficients.

534
01:11:10,950 --> 01:11:13,950
Now we are going to see for relative risks.

535
01:11:15,510 --> 01:11:23,010
We because this is schematic error, this is not random, then we can really we need a calibration study again.

536
01:11:23,010 --> 01:11:34,440
We can really just use one more replicate, right. So, so then we will need the then this imputed true value for the validation calibration study.

537
01:11:34,440 --> 01:11:40,559
So we need to get that gamma. Okay. So then we will have to kind of like assume that we do have kind of like this is your

538
01:11:40,560 --> 01:11:45,540
true intake and this is your offset intake and then you can run like ugly navigation.

539
01:11:45,540 --> 01:11:52,019
So then you get your gamma here and with that gamma you can correct your relative risks in your model S and model.

540
01:11:52,020 --> 01:12:01,890
You are interesting, right? So then the true error in your model is once more the observer divided by the gap.

541
01:12:02,310 --> 01:12:07,640
Right? But that beta is from your registration coefficient because now what you are doing is,

542
01:12:07,650 --> 01:12:12,120
is you have a modeling which you are looking at people with disease,

543
01:12:12,120 --> 01:12:18,959
people with other disease, and they measure that you are your dietary measure that you know that he has systematic error, right?

544
01:12:18,960 --> 01:12:23,380
So then you are going to get a brother that can be translated in on off ratio.

545
01:12:24,120 --> 01:12:28,800
But that beta has systematic error in order to correct that systematic error.

546
01:12:29,160 --> 01:12:33,410
You need that. Gadamer to divide that data from the. So don't worry.

547
01:12:34,050 --> 01:12:41,820
Let's go step by step. So once you correct, the better.

548
01:12:43,590 --> 01:12:49,230
The last thing that you have to do is to initiate that corrected error to get that ratio right.

549
01:12:49,620 --> 01:12:57,330
So so this is kind of like your corrected beta is your observer divided by the gamma,

550
01:12:57,660 --> 01:13:01,530
but what you are interested in is in your relative risk or your of in this situation.

551
01:13:01,560 --> 01:13:06,840
Then you have to respond, initiate that beta studies, which is the same as the beta divided by gamma.

552
01:13:07,110 --> 01:13:12,479
Right. And the only issue with this situation is that this is kind of like an approximation.

553
01:13:12,480 --> 01:13:19,350
This is not as exact as a linear regression that I showed you before, because this the logistic model is not linear.

554
01:13:19,350 --> 01:13:22,370
Right. And in that situation. But it doesn't matter.

555
01:13:22,410 --> 01:13:30,569
So you can still use. So so this is an example from the literature so that you can see here.

556
01:13:30,570 --> 01:13:39,290
This is a logistic regression model relating for breast cancer incidence to saturated fat intake, total alcohol intake and alcohol intake.

557
01:13:39,300 --> 01:13:47,850
This is an analysis study. And then they got some odds ratios here for saturated fat, for total calories,

558
01:13:47,970 --> 01:13:53,850
for alcohol, and they adjust before age and they did this calibration method to correct.

559
01:13:54,150 --> 01:14:02,190
So when they go read this, a ratio point 94 goes to point 84, which is I mean, doesn't really change that really.

560
01:14:03,150 --> 01:14:13,500
This 102 remains the same. But they weren't for alcohol actually kind of like changes cause you that goes from 1.53 to 1.68.

561
01:14:13,910 --> 01:14:18,520
Okay. So so that that was just one example now.

562
01:14:19,450 --> 01:14:28,719
And another thing that you can use this method is to kind of like think about the what are

563
01:14:28,720 --> 01:14:34,000
the observed relative risks for different levels of validity in the measure of exposure.

564
01:14:34,390 --> 01:14:43,299
Because you can think about like if my measure of my measurement of this pressure is the if if we know that 50 is not particularly I mean,

565
01:14:43,300 --> 01:14:46,330
it's valid because you have validated by, you know,

566
01:14:46,330 --> 01:14:51,280
it's sort of so-so so so it doesn't really measure that what the value this

567
01:14:51,280 --> 01:14:55,800
kind of low if the validity is low this is going to affect your odds ratio.

568
01:14:55,810 --> 01:15:04,270
So what happened is that when your ratios are very large, it doesn't matter that much because you still will get something relatively left.

569
01:15:04,270 --> 01:15:07,520
It will get attenuated, but it will be something. Okay.

570
01:15:07,540 --> 01:15:13,780
Right. But when your ratios are low, then with that low validity, you are not going to see anything.

571
01:15:13,810 --> 01:15:17,440
And that was unless you really remember the beginning of the class.

572
01:15:17,440 --> 01:15:26,650
I told you that one of the problems with additionality is that sometimes we find many new associations that may not be known.

573
01:15:26,710 --> 01:15:31,060
It just maybe is just because of the error. So this is one of the situations.

574
01:15:31,750 --> 01:15:36,370
So then what you can do here actually is looking at the other way around, right?

575
01:15:36,370 --> 01:15:41,710
Kind of like just looking at that gamma is kind of like the level of validity in a way.

576
01:15:42,010 --> 01:15:48,969
And using that, you can see this table shows you the observed relative rates for different levels of validity.

577
01:15:48,970 --> 01:15:57,070
So then if your relative risk is five is large, even with very low validity,

578
01:15:57,070 --> 01:16:02,740
which may for example, point to I mean when you have one is clearly hundred percent validity.

579
01:16:02,740 --> 01:16:05,950
So then you get the same as you kind of like decrease.

580
01:16:06,220 --> 01:16:10,959
Then you can see that your odds ratio becomes lower, lower, but even for very low validity,

581
01:16:10,960 --> 01:16:18,160
you still get an official point of 1.58 that may still show that there is an association right in the right direction.

582
01:16:18,160 --> 01:16:27,069
Right. However, when you are, you have a true relative risk that is relatively low like 1.5 even lower validity decreases.

583
01:16:27,070 --> 01:16:31,050
Basically, you will end up in something that is basically not right.

584
01:16:31,450 --> 01:16:35,349
So then you have to think about that because many of the associations between nutrients are

585
01:16:35,350 --> 01:16:42,850
foods or even dietary partners usually are more like in this branch of true relative risks.

586
01:16:42,910 --> 01:16:52,450
Right. So your validity decreases then you're more likely are going to find no results all the time, even though your hypothesis is probably true.

587
01:16:52,460 --> 01:16:56,740
I mean, you may have like a good hypothesis, biological hypothesis that, oh,

588
01:16:56,740 --> 01:17:03,400
I really believe that lycopene is going to be associated with reproductive for prostate cancer.

589
01:17:03,820 --> 01:17:13,000
But if the validity of the way you measure lycopene is low and you don't expect that to be like a high true relative risk,

590
01:17:13,000 --> 01:17:16,210
then you may end up with a normal result. Okay.

591
01:17:20,470 --> 01:17:31,090
Okay. So. Oh, no, let's continue. So then I was going to stop here, but that wasn't a joke.

592
01:17:32,350 --> 01:17:39,910
So this is the one with a big error that might be a yes concession and know friendly.

593
01:17:42,010 --> 01:17:48,669
Okay, so let's let's move into into the the question because this is what we're going to do.

594
01:17:48,670 --> 01:17:54,460
We are going to correct now regression coefficients. And so we are going to use the regression calibration method, right?

595
01:17:55,240 --> 01:18:00,399
And the resolution calibration method requires that a single nutrient estimate is from the day of recall.

596
01:18:00,400 --> 01:18:05,060
That will be the true intake in regression. The same nutrient estimate is a semi quantitative.

597
01:18:05,080 --> 01:18:14,590
And if you measure with that, okay, we are going to use total fat for this exercise and we are going to use the dataset validation.

598
01:18:14,710 --> 01:18:20,500
Okay. So now in that data set, actually, we don't have any basis.

599
01:18:21,250 --> 01:18:22,150
We only have no.

600
01:18:22,540 --> 01:18:31,470
So then it's kind of like, okay, what I how are you want to kind of like change this one because we're going to simulate or this is okay,

601
01:18:31,480 --> 01:18:36,820
so then I show you how to do that. So we're going to work with these two variables.

602
01:18:36,880 --> 01:18:42,640
The default for value is that it's going to be assumed that true intake of total

603
01:18:42,640 --> 01:18:46,300
fat because that's coming from the 28 diet records that the average right

604
01:18:46,690 --> 01:18:51,750
and that the F the default if a few is the intake of total fat from the 50 or

605
01:18:51,760 --> 01:18:55,360
the surrogate measure that is supposed to have both random and systematic.

606
01:18:55,600 --> 01:19:00,040
So we will need that calibration method to kind of like.

607
01:19:00,850 --> 01:19:10,140
Correct. So. So the first thing that I'm going to go with your is to clarify question one.

608
01:19:14,150 --> 01:19:17,510
And for that, I need to go to the.

609
01:19:22,670 --> 01:19:25,910
Here. Okay.

610
01:19:27,250 --> 01:19:39,930
So. So you go to this escort, you do have this escort also to load that because you will need to run back.

611
01:19:40,560 --> 01:19:45,510
So let me introduce this.

612
01:20:05,280 --> 01:20:13,800
Okay. So you got to assess. The first thing that we are going to do is that we're going to simulate this process, okay.

613
01:20:13,810 --> 01:20:15,510
Because we don't have ideas. Isn't that the lesson?

614
01:20:18,160 --> 01:20:25,840
So there is this process where the simulated in a way that is actually associated with a true intake of the that we are going to have a good chip.

615
01:20:25,840 --> 01:20:29,020
We are going to kind of like create something that we know is associated with good.

616
01:20:29,020 --> 01:20:37,299
Well, they're simulating way. So then then once we know that is associated, we know that the other thing it will have error.

617
01:20:37,300 --> 01:20:40,080
So because it has error, then we need to correct for that. Right?

618
01:20:40,630 --> 01:20:50,620
So so what we are going to do is there to model the probability of disease as a function of this portion,

619
01:20:50,620 --> 01:20:56,230
which is going to be the intake of total fat. And we are going to use that through intake of to the fat from the right direction.

620
01:20:56,350 --> 01:21:00,649
Right. And this is this is the equation which is basically this equation of a logistic regression.

621
01:21:00,650 --> 01:21:08,890
And so this is kind of like the the the the logic of of of the risk is that I'm not telling you of which this is this can be a genetic disease.

622
01:21:09,310 --> 01:21:15,880
And this is kind of like an alpha beta. And this by explanation, in this way, you get your information, right.

623
01:21:16,510 --> 01:21:27,030
So now what we are going to do is that the first thing we are going to do is to center kind of like the the day,

624
01:21:28,540 --> 01:21:32,380
the nutrients and so kind of like to strengthen their means.

625
01:21:33,970 --> 01:21:35,200
And we are doing that.

626
01:21:35,350 --> 01:21:42,549
So the intercept of the logistic models will be the logic of the probability of disease for individuals with mean intake instead of zero,

627
01:21:42,550 --> 01:21:48,330
which makes more sense. But that doesn't that's not particularly relevant.

628
01:21:48,350 --> 01:21:52,870
So you can I mean, we are doing that, but you will just run that. I'm not going to do anything about that.

629
01:21:52,870 --> 01:21:57,400
So you will run this. But so this is the last thing. Okay, so that you would have to run that.

630
01:21:57,940 --> 01:22:03,120
Now, when you go to the this is simulation, we are going to do it.

631
01:22:03,130 --> 01:22:07,240
This is kind of like a run here, right? So then you just need to run that.

632
01:22:07,810 --> 01:22:14,620
Now the priority of the system are safe, yet with average intake of a set of point of light.

633
01:22:14,720 --> 01:22:22,530
That's what we are kind of like doing. Doing here, right.

634
01:22:22,810 --> 01:22:32,230
So this is going to be the cumulative incidence. Right. So we are defining the cumulative incidence for this is for kind of like .05.

635
01:22:32,350 --> 01:22:37,149
Right. And then we are so then our alpha will be like that.

636
01:22:37,150 --> 01:22:41,560
And the and you don't need to remember this because I mean, this is something that and now this is our model.

637
01:22:41,930 --> 01:22:46,350
So this is kind of like we are using this point all for one.

638
01:22:46,360 --> 01:22:50,679
And then I you will see why. And then we are considering in case it's zero.

639
01:22:50,680 --> 01:22:54,700
And then we are going to create a random variable uniform between zero and one.

640
01:22:55,180 --> 01:23:02,650
And then don't change this because this is a random. So if you change these, then do we have different data than your classmates?

641
01:23:03,910 --> 01:23:09,040
And then we will assign that this is we have a reliability that will come from that random fashion.

642
01:23:09,080 --> 01:23:17,559
Okay. So then basically what we are doing here is that we are simulating and this is some people we have this

643
01:23:17,560 --> 01:23:27,580
is some people want and that this is going to be associated with total effort with another ratio of 1.5.

644
01:23:30,830 --> 01:23:39,140
So now if we go back to sorry, we will go back to question one.

645
01:23:39,500 --> 01:23:45,409
And this is the one that we're going to do together. I'm asking you using information from that.

646
01:23:45,410 --> 01:23:55,160
Cisco showed that the logistic model implies an author ratio of 1.5 for an increase in diagrams by the end of the meeting.

647
01:23:55,790 --> 01:24:05,420
So basically what we are going to do is that I'm going to review with you the basics of logistic regression.

648
01:24:05,780 --> 01:24:08,599
So then you I mean, I know that, you know, logistic regression,

649
01:24:08,600 --> 01:24:15,650
but it's good to review with you so you understand what the models me and you understand really what that means.

650
01:24:15,770 --> 01:24:27,899
Okay. So. So when you have binary data, you know, you cannot use linear relation, right?

651
01:24:27,900 --> 01:24:33,719
And that where we are this new model which is logistic model, right?

652
01:24:33,720 --> 01:24:40,950
So you kind of like logistic regression, but the logistic function which basically models the probability will be in a case,

653
01:24:40,950 --> 01:24:45,620
which is that going to like this is the way to function, right?

654
01:24:45,630 --> 01:24:48,910
So it's kind of like this what? Right.

655
01:24:48,960 --> 01:24:54,240
So it's kind of like, well, it has like too many letters, so that's the logistic function.

656
01:24:55,680 --> 01:24:58,470
But when we put that in our model,

657
01:24:59,010 --> 01:25:10,889
so basically through kind of like algebra changes where we and that is kind of like showing that the left side of the

658
01:25:10,890 --> 01:25:18,270
equation is actually the log arch because this is the probability of having the this is the probability in the hub,

659
01:25:18,390 --> 01:25:21,510
right? And this is the low and this side of the push in the right.

660
01:25:21,510 --> 01:25:32,020
So the question remains the same in linear relation, but a linear is that is a linear is part of the generated linear family logistic regression.

661
01:25:32,160 --> 01:25:38,710
Right. So now. Our logistic regression is like that.

662
01:25:38,860 --> 01:25:42,280
We call this the low youth on the look. Right.

663
01:25:42,580 --> 01:25:48,310
And this is the linear side of the equation. Okay. And remember, we are using natural locks.

664
01:25:48,730 --> 01:25:55,750
Now, what is the meaning of the barrel confusion? If we kind of like use our largest derivation.

665
01:25:56,260 --> 01:26:00,370
So you apply here the same as you were using linear regression.

666
01:26:01,000 --> 01:26:11,020
Basically, the meaning of this will be the rate of change in the log out of the event under study as x ten years one unit.

667
01:26:11,080 --> 01:26:16,510
Right. So remember when when this was a linear regression, this was like just one continuous variable.

668
01:26:16,810 --> 01:26:26,890
So the meaning of the word acquisition was the change in the outcome variable when the independent variable changes one unit.

669
01:26:27,100 --> 01:26:31,600
That was your kind of like interpretation of the data, right?

670
01:26:31,900 --> 01:26:36,110
So now the interpretation of the data in all these models is still the same.

671
01:26:36,130 --> 01:26:42,070
The problem is that now the left side of the equation has changed is no longer like just

672
01:26:42,080 --> 01:26:47,230
a continuous right now is something that is the log but which looks like pretty weird,

673
01:26:47,350 --> 01:26:53,950
right? Kind of like is like the log of what they did on their study, which is kind of like not easy to interpret.

674
01:26:54,970 --> 01:27:00,520
Now what happened and this is the what I call the operation to the rescue,

675
01:27:00,730 --> 01:27:10,150
is that through some algebra that I can explain to you now, if you appreciate the error, you do get your ratio.

676
01:27:10,390 --> 01:27:17,110
So that way in logistic regression, you don't kind of like use the whereas for interpretation, you use this ratio, right?

677
01:27:17,650 --> 01:27:21,970
So the ratio comes from exponential in the way. Now I'm going to show you.

678
01:27:23,140 --> 01:27:31,060
So this black box in between is not such like a terrible black box.

679
01:27:31,210 --> 01:27:35,800
So it's just some easy algebra that you can do on yourself.

680
01:27:36,040 --> 01:27:42,620
And then what we can do is to kind of like use two way to tables to go into logistic regression

681
01:27:42,670 --> 01:27:47,280
and show then you understand what that is when initiating the way that comes is coming from,

682
01:27:47,290 --> 01:27:52,360
right? So when you have a two way two table and this is your response, your one zero,

683
01:27:52,510 --> 01:28:01,120
your this is why zero you know that your odds ratio is the kind of like product that values I maybe divided by BBC right.

684
01:28:03,580 --> 01:28:09,280
Now remember that in the logistic model we are modeling probabilities, right?

685
01:28:09,310 --> 01:28:16,950
So the probability of the disease for a given value of this push ratio, this is our famous logit, all of us.

686
01:28:17,000 --> 01:28:18,489
This is the probability having to do.

687
01:28:18,490 --> 01:28:26,490
This is the way we write, considering x x can be at zero one right divided by the priority or no having it right.

688
01:28:26,500 --> 01:28:30,170
And then this is kind of like the linear side of the equation.

689
01:28:30,230 --> 01:28:36,030
Right now, this X, which is our response, you can be you may be both.

690
01:28:37,060 --> 01:28:40,300
So then you will be X one or you may be an S boss.

691
01:28:40,690 --> 01:28:54,160
So then you will be zero, right? So when you are in a spot that low, you so the log of the probability of being zero becomes actually alpha, right?

692
01:28:54,190 --> 01:28:58,390
Because this is zero, x is the ratio, then it just of right.

693
01:28:59,230 --> 01:29:02,480
Which is the intercept. Right. That's the meaning of the intercept. Right.

694
01:29:03,340 --> 01:29:13,810
But when X is equal one then that logit of the probability of having the disease, considering that you are is both is alpha plus vector.

695
01:29:14,350 --> 01:29:21,729
Okay. Now, on the other hand, separately, we know that the odds of disease are one on this.

696
01:29:21,730 --> 01:29:28,840
Both would be the probability of having the disease, considering that you are not is both divided by the probability of not having the disease.

697
01:29:28,840 --> 01:29:34,959
Considering again, not this both right. So this ratio and the odds of this is someone is both is the same.

698
01:29:34,960 --> 01:29:43,030
But being this plot, having the disease considered in the US, both divided by the probability and having the disease considering that you are as both.

699
01:29:43,540 --> 01:29:47,440
And of course the odds ratio is the ratio of those two things.

700
01:29:47,620 --> 01:29:49,599
Right. That's the definition of the odds ratio. Right.

701
01:29:49,600 --> 01:29:54,970
The odds of this, if someone is both and the odds of this is among them to spot, so is the ratio of those two things.

702
01:29:56,050 --> 01:30:00,730
Now there's some. I don't know why.

703
01:30:02,080 --> 01:30:06,180
Every time I use this computer, it changes my symbols. Okay. Know.

704
01:30:06,210 --> 01:30:12,830
Know you see the correct symbol or you see a still this is called minus sign is a minus.

705
01:30:12,850 --> 01:30:17,680
Yeah. You see. Okay. Yeah. So, I don't know, it's just going right.

706
01:30:17,980 --> 01:30:25,360
Okay. So now we are going to do the trick that your algebra teachers in high school used to do.

707
01:30:25,450 --> 01:30:30,490
Right. And I like that you some something them do their strategy and then you haven't done anything right.

708
01:30:30,940 --> 01:30:37,880
So you're I want to tell you that mirror is equals to alpha plus minus alpha, which is true.

709
01:30:37,930 --> 01:30:42,550
I mean the qualities that. Right. Jasmine alpha and strength enough.

710
01:30:42,850 --> 01:30:47,590
Right. But now what I'm going to say is that okay but alpha,

711
01:30:48,460 --> 01:30:58,680
remember from here is the logic of the probability of having the disease continuing that you are not the spot and Alpha Zeta is the law.

712
01:30:58,690 --> 01:31:01,240
You are the probability. This is considered to be your response.

713
01:31:01,780 --> 01:31:13,299
So what I'm doing is that this alpha substitute for the law of B1 and this kind of like beta minus alpha, what I'm going do this,

714
01:31:13,300 --> 01:31:20,590
I'm going to put the minus there and then I'm going to have a Vera, and then it's going to be the low of the probability of having the disease.

715
01:31:20,590 --> 01:31:28,660
Considering that you're not this boss and I have to two lawyers that does not use actually the lock alt right.

716
01:31:29,020 --> 01:31:32,980
So this is the look of this. All right? And this is the look of this odds.

717
01:31:33,550 --> 01:31:46,120
And then if you remember from the log properties, the differences of two is actually the ratio of the two things inside the log, right?

718
01:31:46,390 --> 01:31:54,820
So this is just a property of the logarithms, right? So then this difference is going to be the love of these two things, this and this.

719
01:31:55,600 --> 01:32:00,190
But a it happens that what is this? This is the ratio.

720
01:32:01,180 --> 01:32:11,830
So then basically if the bearer is equal to the log of the ratio means that by is in beta, I give this ratio the ten.

721
01:32:12,460 --> 01:32:16,120
So I know. Did you go through this in your by statistic classes.

722
01:32:17,800 --> 01:32:34,320
No. Yes. Right. So now we go again, because this is important to remember the first question, which is basically what I'm telling you,

723
01:32:34,410 --> 01:32:42,420
using information from the source code for this homework showed that the logistic model that we are creating,

724
01:32:42,930 --> 01:32:51,320
this is a simulation, but we are getting that in place and odds ratio of 1.5 for an increase in diagrams by the end of the study.

725
01:32:52,050 --> 01:32:55,290
So then if you go here, what is your logistic model?

726
01:32:57,360 --> 01:33:06,830
That's right. So this is kind of like this is your better coefficient, right?

727
01:33:07,860 --> 01:33:14,520
.041. So how can you show me from that point zero for one that the odds ratio is 1.5?

728
01:33:16,710 --> 01:33:19,760
Because that's what I wanted to show. Right. That's what I wanted to create.

729
01:33:19,770 --> 01:33:24,750
I wanted to create, simulate a model in which the odds ratio is going to be 1.5.

730
01:33:25,830 --> 01:33:30,450
Why did I chose? I beat out 0.0 for one.

731
01:33:44,670 --> 01:33:48,440
Anyone. It's that easy.

732
01:33:48,510 --> 01:33:57,150
So you're thinking like it cannot be that easy. It is that easy. Anyone.

733
01:33:57,810 --> 01:34:03,390
And I know it's just a question. It's confusing, but the solution is actually it's three for one.

734
01:34:10,710 --> 01:34:15,360
Along with other contributors. So the question is.

735
01:34:18,250 --> 01:34:22,420
Using information from the source code so that the model that you have showed,

736
01:34:22,420 --> 01:34:27,160
that the logistic model that you have implies that the odds ratio is going to be 1.5.

737
01:34:31,730 --> 01:34:36,250
Actually two points or 3.3 for one.

738
01:34:36,460 --> 01:34:39,820
Yeah, exactly. You just need to do that.

739
01:34:41,620 --> 01:34:45,340
I know it sounds crazy to be true, right?

740
01:34:45,940 --> 01:34:54,040
So can you go to the whiteboard and whatever?

741
01:35:03,230 --> 01:35:11,420
And then when I said, well, I mean, you have to multiply by ten because I'm asking you to do it by ten grams of fat.

742
01:35:11,510 --> 01:35:16,220
Right. Yeah.

743
01:35:16,230 --> 01:35:22,550
So you're better. You're better from the. From here.

744
01:35:22,670 --> 01:35:26,400
So let me let me open the scheduling.

745
01:35:26,720 --> 01:35:29,720
I think this is here. So, actually, this is here.

746
01:35:29,720 --> 01:35:41,630
So. So. So this better is 0.4 for one, right?

747
01:35:42,470 --> 01:35:55,120
So in question one, what I'm asking you is to kind of like that you get that better multiplier right then because that's, that's my thing.

748
01:35:55,340 --> 01:35:59,990
My ten grams by one gram, then you get another ratio of 1.5.

749
01:36:00,110 --> 01:36:03,800
So 1.5 should be kind of like that. So basically.

750
01:36:04,340 --> 01:36:08,040
So if you take the natural at 1.3. Yeah, we'll always natural.

751
01:36:08,540 --> 01:36:14,090
That's right. I mean and so that there's plenty to touch on is the inverse of the natural.

752
01:36:14,270 --> 01:36:19,670
So that way you have to work with those two factions. Okay. So kind of like basically is this.

753
01:36:25,710 --> 01:36:31,110
So this is the question. Okay. So just copies from Dan.

754
01:36:33,220 --> 01:36:42,180
Unlike us. Now related to that and very important.

755
01:36:43,410 --> 01:36:50,489
When you create a confidence interval for the odds ratio, remember,

756
01:36:50,490 --> 01:36:58,410
all confidence intervals are always created when you use the normal distribution by subtracting ten and adding 1.96,

757
01:36:58,410 --> 01:37:01,630
the standard error ratio, the coffee table will be 95%.

758
01:37:02,250 --> 01:37:08,760
If you want the confidence interval different than the 95%, 99 or 90, you have to use another another.

759
01:37:09,060 --> 01:37:15,180
Another CPA rate will be 1.96, but usually 95% confidence interval is the standard, right?

760
01:37:15,900 --> 01:37:21,450
So then this is the usual way of calculating a confidence interval for an odd ratio.

761
01:37:21,480 --> 01:37:27,600
You cannot do it directly. You're going to really put the odds ratio 1.86 and there's on that, right?

762
01:37:27,630 --> 01:37:32,770
I mean, you have to calculate first. I mean, luckily, because you won't get an estimate of a from the ratio.

763
01:37:33,150 --> 01:37:37,350
So you get a better understand that error from the logistic model, right.

764
01:37:37,380 --> 01:37:45,480
For your parameter estimate. So then first you have to construct the 95% confidence interval for the data from the modern ratio.

765
01:37:45,480 --> 01:37:47,400
Then that way you will do it that way.

766
01:37:47,790 --> 01:37:59,580
And then once you have those, the lower limit and the upper limit, your race to be those and then you get your confidence interval for the ratio.

767
01:37:59,760 --> 01:38:02,280
Okay. So then that's that's the way of doing it. Okay.

768
01:38:02,280 --> 01:38:09,209
Don't don't get kind of like confused with this because you do want to do something manually and you don't do it properly.

769
01:38:09,210 --> 01:38:12,420
Then your because of the log, you are going to get something completely wrong.

770
01:38:12,510 --> 01:38:15,420
Okay. So follow this, this, this way of doing things.

771
01:38:15,750 --> 01:38:22,590
Now, this is if you're estimating for one unit change, but if you are estimating by a different unit,

772
01:38:22,590 --> 01:38:31,380
which is the case of this particular exercise we are using, then then you will need to multiply the data on the standard error by then.

773
01:38:31,740 --> 01:38:36,240
Okay. So be careful because we had that situation at the end of the of the homework

774
01:38:36,240 --> 01:38:40,139
with the computation that was I'm giving you the template in Excel to do it,

775
01:38:40,140 --> 01:38:44,640
but I am going to pay attention anyway. Okay. So.

776
01:38:46,470 --> 01:38:50,030
So also remember how to work your results.

777
01:38:50,040 --> 01:38:55,170
I have been already kind of like telling you this is a few hours ago.

778
01:38:56,700 --> 01:39:00,720
We have to use the old don't use waste, don't use something else.

779
01:39:01,080 --> 01:39:04,230
And remember that you have protective factors.

780
01:39:06,240 --> 01:39:14,860
You cannot really say that something is spoiled 9.8 times lower because is not true and same point 80 times higher.

781
01:39:14,860 --> 01:39:21,790
It will be aware, right? So for protective factors, I prefer you to use the one minus those ratio percentage.

782
01:39:21,810 --> 01:39:26,340
Kind of like that order over here because that's that's kind of like a better way of doing it.

783
01:39:26,350 --> 01:39:28,499
So then remember I gave you the template.

784
01:39:28,500 --> 01:39:37,319
So this will be when of ratios harmful for categorical variable or for good deliverables but for protective use these this one.

785
01:39:37,320 --> 01:39:41,490
Okay, kind of like the them the the percentage.

786
01:39:41,490 --> 01:39:44,910
I mean, you could do this one, but I mean, I don't really like it.

787
01:39:45,210 --> 01:39:51,990
I prefer this one, right? This is kind of like more straightforward because that way you can say certain percentage lower,

788
01:39:51,990 --> 01:39:56,080
which is what people are expecting when they see I'm not ratio that is protecting.

789
01:39:56,380 --> 01:39:59,600
Okay. Okay. Okay.

790
01:39:59,610 --> 01:40:03,120
Now we will have a break where we have peace that we can actually move.

791
01:40:03,480 --> 01:40:06,990
We still have 10 minutes. We can do two things.

792
01:40:07,050 --> 01:40:16,410
You can we can leave earlier or you can start working on the on the on the on the homework.

793
01:40:16,410 --> 01:40:24,330
Now, on the on the second part, what would you prefer? Less work.

794
01:40:24,860 --> 01:40:34,670
Yeah. So, I mean, I'm not saying you're kind of like going so so whenever you kind of like.

795
01:40:42,470 --> 01:40:47,000
Have you finished the question? One, and now you have your vote.

796
01:40:47,020 --> 01:40:50,690
Natalie, we need to finish here because I have to explain.

797
01:40:50,690 --> 01:40:58,450
You have something else. No, no, I done it.

798
01:40:58,810 --> 01:41:02,660
Yeah, you can. You can work on that. You can work on the work. Yeah. Yeah.

799
01:41:03,220 --> 01:41:06,790
So you will have to run this.

800
01:41:07,030 --> 01:41:12,480
So. Sure. I mean, let me show you. So you will have to run this.

801
01:41:12,490 --> 01:41:19,690
So then you create you have your kind of like your this is okay.

802
01:41:20,080 --> 01:41:41,440
And then you look at. If you look at where you live is that basically now by running that simulation now you have basically simulated a disease.

803
01:41:41,460 --> 01:41:44,860
I mean, some people will be gassy, some people will be controls.

804
01:41:45,150 --> 01:41:52,170
Okay. But in a way that that this is going to be associated with your total fight with another ratio of 1.5.

805
01:41:56,640 --> 01:42:11,350
So. So once you move from here, then.

806
01:42:11,650 --> 01:42:17,080
What you have to do now is let me show you B, C and D.

807
01:42:17,710 --> 01:42:20,350
So basically all you have to do is that me?

808
01:42:20,350 --> 01:42:26,649
First you have to run the simulation because otherwise you will have an easy life and then you are going to

809
01:42:26,650 --> 01:42:33,520
run a logistic regression to calculate the decision between total fat on the day record and your disease.

810
01:42:34,000 --> 01:42:38,050
Right? So this is opposite of your goal, that this is where you have been before.

811
01:42:38,620 --> 01:42:45,519
Use the center variable for this one, right? You're going to use this this one and I icon contract estimator.

812
01:42:45,520 --> 01:42:53,050
You can interpret the ratio for adding grams increasing fat instead of only one gram because otherwise you will get very small revisions.

813
01:42:55,330 --> 01:43:02,830
So now and then you have to interpret the ratio that you get from the contract statement and know that because of this,

814
01:43:02,990 --> 01:43:08,500
this doesn't have a name and is not specified usually.

815
01:43:08,500 --> 01:43:12,010
Also, this is done specify the disease.

816
01:43:12,430 --> 01:43:18,459
So now the first in B basically you are running the logistic regression model again.

817
01:43:18,460 --> 01:43:23,990
So then you should get kind of like a similar ratio that you created, right?

818
01:43:24,030 --> 01:43:27,270
It's just kind of like going back in circles in a way.

819
01:43:28,090 --> 01:43:29,830
Now, in the second part,

820
01:43:30,430 --> 01:43:38,950
what you're going to do is you are going to run a logistic regression with your measure of total fat from the few that the surrogate measured.

821
01:43:38,970 --> 01:43:46,030
That's the one that has several, right? So no one in B doesn't have that or that the true ending is the one from the fifth that has error.

822
01:43:46,150 --> 01:43:53,240
Right. So then this is the uncorrected odds ratio by the one with L and again,

823
01:43:53,270 --> 01:43:59,410
use the center variable again and also use a contrast estimate I can show you always do it by ten grams.

824
01:43:59,740 --> 01:44:02,799
Okay. And then interpret the ratio properly. So.

825
01:44:02,800 --> 01:44:08,170
Well, if that one has error, what are your expecting your odds ratio to to be?

826
01:44:12,180 --> 01:44:17,150
Similar to 1.5 for. Yeah.

827
01:44:17,240 --> 01:44:21,170
She would be different. She would be probably. I mean, however, she probably will be.

828
01:44:21,170 --> 01:44:22,210
I can wait attenuated I mean,

829
01:44:22,250 --> 01:44:28,490
in the best because that is just a medical rose can go in this situation it will be attenuated if you will have a lower level.

830
01:44:28,910 --> 01:44:32,750
So now you want to correct that relative risk.

831
01:44:33,380 --> 01:44:44,209
And for that, because this is supposed to be a systematic EVA on top of them to I guess do need that calibration kind of like.

832
01:44:44,210 --> 01:44:45,200
Is that right.

833
01:44:45,650 --> 01:44:53,510
So then indeed that what you are going to do so you will have none of like you will have that you have to do that to a calibration method.

834
01:44:53,510 --> 01:44:58,160
So the first thing that you have to do is to get your gamma. Gamma is your correct your factor.

835
01:44:58,490 --> 01:45:06,770
That gamma comes from a linear regression of your true total fat and the surrogate measure of total fat.

836
01:45:06,770 --> 01:45:13,100
So the effort for value on the fact if if you in this situation don't do this and it doesn't matter this

837
01:45:13,130 --> 01:45:18,110
and everybody else will be happy about don't use this and then what I now and this is a linear regression.

838
01:45:18,110 --> 01:45:25,910
Okay, so then in this in elevation and I don't get confused because this is very easy to get confused.

839
01:45:26,450 --> 01:45:31,340
Whatever beta you get from that linear regression, that's your gamma.

840
01:45:31,640 --> 01:45:35,470
Okay. Because what you are doing is this right.

841
01:45:35,960 --> 01:45:43,480
Basically. This is your dream big and this is the song.

842
01:45:43,690 --> 01:45:50,960
So I'm just doing a new vision. I mean, whatever they can do with not, you know, revision that better is going to be your correction factor.

843
01:45:51,030 --> 01:45:59,620
That is going to be your game. So now use that game to correct the old ratio you got and see.

844
01:46:05,540 --> 01:46:18,500
Okay. And then finally in E, I'm asking you to calculate confidence intervals for all the R ratios estimated above from part B, C and D.

845
01:46:18,680 --> 01:46:27,379
Okay. And then you can use let me show you because you can use the Excel template, because I mean,

846
01:46:27,380 --> 01:46:33,500
it can be a little tricky when you do it for a ten units increase and particularly for decorative one.

847
01:46:33,500 --> 01:46:39,190
So you have one that is the true one that is uncorrected and one that is corrected.

848
01:46:39,320 --> 01:46:42,410
So I want three sets of confidence intervals.

849
01:46:42,410 --> 01:46:49,400
Decorative one. The confidence intervals are more complex because they involve gamma and the standard level of gamma.

850
01:46:49,820 --> 01:46:55,610
Okay. And then also because these 410 units increased, then it will require more calculation.

851
01:46:55,640 --> 01:47:01,840
So what I'm doing here is that I'm giving you the templates in Excel so you just can copy the formula on calculator.

852
01:47:02,240 --> 01:47:19,060
But let me show you. So this template.

853
01:47:23,210 --> 01:47:26,750
Well, I'm not a lawyer. So then you can see.

854
01:47:41,950 --> 01:47:46,170
Yeah. So can you see.

855
01:47:56,720 --> 01:48:04,430
Okay. So so this is kind of like the confidence intervals for the operations that don't have any correction.

856
01:48:04,430 --> 01:48:07,579
So that will be for the model that you get in,

857
01:48:07,580 --> 01:48:14,479
be right for the integrity record and the model and you get and see that is then corrective one for the fifth.

858
01:48:14,480 --> 01:48:24,530
Q So then if you decide the formula, so you just kind of like copy this here and put an equal and then.

859
01:48:28,640 --> 01:48:33,080
For God. And I love my future.

860
01:48:33,080 --> 01:48:39,590
So then. To late this.

861
01:48:42,240 --> 01:48:46,410
No. This is not what I want. Look at me.

862
01:48:46,500 --> 01:48:56,879
The way. This way. Call me. Okay.

863
01:48:56,880 --> 01:49:02,880
So now I have my formula here. If I get here, they say this is.

864
01:49:11,280 --> 01:49:16,350
Then what you do is that you assist in this by this.

865
01:49:16,470 --> 01:49:19,110
Okay, so then you get your 1.5.

866
01:49:19,650 --> 01:49:27,410
So the only thing I would put in the formula is that you can copy them and substitute the corresponding parameters with the with the,

867
01:49:27,420 --> 01:49:31,560
with the says okay. And the same for everything else.

868
01:49:31,620 --> 01:49:42,120
Okay. Now for the Australia that has a correction, note that you need not only your better understanding of the better,

869
01:49:42,120 --> 01:49:45,239
but you also need the gamma and the standard error of the gamma.

870
01:49:45,240 --> 01:49:49,500
And remember that gamma understand that in order the gamma is the data from the

871
01:49:49,500 --> 01:49:52,620
linear regression and the standard error from developing the linear regression.

872
01:49:52,620 --> 01:49:55,830
So don't get confused with us on Gamma. That's why we call it Gamma.

873
01:49:55,950 --> 01:49:57,880
And then you don't get confused with this other data.

874
01:49:58,240 --> 01:50:07,350
But so then if you populate everything here and then you use these formulas and nobody's formulas are more complicated, right?

875
01:50:08,430 --> 01:50:17,030
So then you should be able to kind of like get everything kind of like the odds ratio with a lower confidence interval.

876
01:50:17,730 --> 01:50:24,960
Confidence. Okay. Okay.

877
01:50:25,710 --> 01:50:35,870
Any questions? I think we are done. Okay. So we will we will stop here.

878
01:50:35,880 --> 01:50:46,470
And then next week, I will spend a little bit more about a few scenes that are still hanging and then explain a little bit about them.

879
01:50:46,780 --> 01:50:49,920
And then we will devote the rest of the class to these questions.

880
01:50:50,460 --> 01:50:53,070
And they. You want to do the Aztec? Great. Okay.
