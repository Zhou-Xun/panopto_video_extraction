1
00:00:09,260 --> 00:00:17,570
Let's continue the discussion about negotiation. In this last segment, we'll focus on two pieces one,

2
00:00:18,440 --> 00:00:27,740
negotiation as a means for advancing interests and negotiation as a process for joint problem solving.

3
00:00:28,680 --> 00:00:41,860
Before we proceed. I think it will be useful to emphasize one more time that negotiation should not be an end in itself is not just a game to play.

4
00:00:42,790 --> 00:00:46,960
Also. To bring about sustainable agreements.

5
00:00:47,470 --> 00:00:54,640
Negotiations won't be successful if the goal is to satisfy our interests only.

6
00:00:56,760 --> 00:01:07,910
And to recap the previous discussion. In negotiation, we should not so much ask what is my position and assure this is my position.

7
00:01:08,450 --> 00:01:17,659
Instead, we shall seek. We should try to understand directly and indirectly what the real interests

8
00:01:17,660 --> 00:01:23,660
are that lie behind our position as well as the position of our counterparts.

9
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:34,770
Another crucial question to ask involves Vietnam, which stands for Best Alternative to Negotiated Agreement.

10
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:38,950
Better now, also known as no agreement.

11
00:01:38,950 --> 00:01:46,780
Alternative is the course of action that one would take if the proposed deal were not possible,

12
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:52,569
or the alternative that we may consider if no agreement can be reached through

13
00:01:52,570 --> 00:01:57,910
negotiation depending on the issue on the negotiation table and the situation involved.

14
00:01:58,780 --> 00:02:01,030
I offer you several example or better.

15
00:02:01,660 --> 00:02:09,670
It may include walking away, doing without any agreement or approaching a different potential partner to form an alliance,

16
00:02:10,330 --> 00:02:17,800
switching to a different supplier or buyer, providing a service line in-house, rather then contracting the service out.

17
00:02:18,950 --> 00:02:23,660
Or going on a strike to force an employer for different proposal.

18
00:02:24,570 --> 00:02:30,270
Or if the issue is a legal dispute going to the court without saddling.

19
00:02:30,660 --> 00:02:38,270
All these are examples. I'll bet now. Whatever the situation may be to negotiate effectively,

20
00:02:38,900 --> 00:02:49,760
we have to continually assess our as well as our counterparts better so that we can determine if there is a possibility of reaching an agreement.

21
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:57,860
This is crucial because whatever agreement that is reached has to be better than bad enough or the best no

22
00:02:57,860 --> 00:03:06,080
agreement alternative in terms of satisfying our interests as well as the interests of our counterparts.

23
00:03:06,620 --> 00:03:09,800
This is a necessary condition for agreement.

24
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:20,170
Let's make it more concrete and go back to the example of physician contract negotiation between Henry for health system and chess.

25
00:03:21,210 --> 00:03:27,960
In this case, Henry Ford Health Systems Partner will be terminating the physician contract with

26
00:03:27,960 --> 00:03:34,080
stress and perhaps no longer offering hospital and specialty care to patients.

27
00:03:35,090 --> 00:03:39,919
Well, yes. The bed now may be to form a partnership with a different medical center.

28
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:43,520
For example, Detroit Medical Center, or CHASS,

29
00:03:43,520 --> 00:03:50,540
can recall their own primary care physicians to staff the clinics rather than relying on other organizations.

30
00:03:51,570 --> 00:03:53,610
In order to keep the negotiation going.

31
00:03:54,420 --> 00:04:03,330
The proposed cost increase in the physician contract should look better than Henry Ford's health systems, as well as Chaz's.

32
00:04:03,900 --> 00:04:07,610
The. This means for hiring for health system.

33
00:04:08,180 --> 00:04:14,569
The cost increase in the physician contract shall look better than the balance of their loss in physician

34
00:04:14,570 --> 00:04:21,230
recruitment and retention and their revenue from offering hospital and specialty care to jazz patients.

35
00:04:22,510 --> 00:04:31,540
For chess. The cost increase should not be a threat to their financial viability and should be better than the alternatives

36
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:38,890
of seeking a physician contract with a different health system or having their own primary care physicians.

37
00:04:39,940 --> 00:04:49,210
A very important implication of discussing the concept back to now is this You should invest efforts to improve your back to now,

38
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:54,070
namely your alternatives. If no agreement is reached,

39
00:04:54,820 --> 00:05:04,990
the reason is actually quite intuitive because the able to walk away from the negotiation can significantly increase your negotiating power.

40
00:05:05,650 --> 00:05:14,770
Also, the better your partner appears both to you and to your counterpart, the more credible your threat to walk away would be.

41
00:05:15,370 --> 00:05:21,280
Is a threat is credible. You have a chance to ask your counterpart for a better deal.

42
00:05:22,060 --> 00:05:25,840
The question is how do you improve now?

43
00:05:26,950 --> 00:05:33,790
Requires you to draw a very wide circle in your analysis and spend time,

44
00:05:33,790 --> 00:05:42,820
energy and resources on improving your tentatives your options away from the table to prepare for the negotiation,

45
00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:51,100
rather than focusing only on improving the deal and your negotiating skill at the table during the negotiation.

46
00:05:52,190 --> 00:05:59,420
As the Web TV founder Steve Perlman said, if you cannot walk away, you cannot negotiate.

47
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:08,690
So that's apply this principle to the physician contract example and think from the point of view of chess.

48
00:06:10,390 --> 00:06:15,610
In this negotiation, chess is a much less dominant party.

49
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:22,390
Chess is the David against Henry Ford, the Goliath.

50
00:06:24,590 --> 00:06:35,829
Applying the principle that we just discussed. Chess negotiation power can be greatly expanded if they could solicit a similar

51
00:06:35,830 --> 00:06:40,900
physician contract and patient referral relationship with a different center.

52
00:06:40,930 --> 00:06:43,690
For example. The Detroit Medical Center.
