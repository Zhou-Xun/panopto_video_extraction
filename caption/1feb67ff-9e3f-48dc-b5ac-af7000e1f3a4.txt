1
00:00:00,600 --> 00:00:05,350
Oh, wait. I get the wrong thing. I regret it.

2
00:00:06,150 --> 00:00:14,150
You know. Give me a second. I think I have the wrong name, and I know.

3
00:00:16,200 --> 00:00:21,150
All right. Everybody found the group. Who am I?

4
00:00:21,240 --> 00:00:33,810
I'm this if you know, that's the wrong thing to think.

5
00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:36,030
All right. Well, we're going to go with whatever slides are here.

6
00:00:36,810 --> 00:00:56,610
But the thing about him is that not only did he get well into the 111, but we have now the story.

7
00:00:56,850 --> 00:01:00,050
Okay. I'm sorry. Something is little bit awry here.

8
00:01:00,060 --> 00:01:10,380
I apologize. I've got the link to the wrong slides, so I will fix that after class.

9
00:01:11,130 --> 00:01:14,460
But for now. Okay, we've got this.

10
00:01:23,150 --> 00:01:33,200
The novel is super quiet unless watching me. I'm not sure.

11
00:01:37,640 --> 00:01:42,050
This book. No introduction.

12
00:01:42,750 --> 00:01:46,790
I'm looking for U.S. cancer. All right. We are going to go with.

13
00:01:48,350 --> 00:01:53,210
No, no, no, no, no. Stop. What is happening here?

14
00:01:53,330 --> 00:01:56,870
Can you certify the name so that would come up? But it's here.

15
00:01:57,830 --> 00:02:03,040
This is going to happen. We're serious and we're done here.

16
00:02:03,170 --> 00:02:07,470
So you. Yes, I think we're in.

17
00:02:07,490 --> 00:02:10,920
Okay. All right. Are we on our grips?

18
00:02:11,150 --> 00:02:15,090
Because we're going to we're going to want to go.

19
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:23,510
And you found a group three person. Good. Okay. Is anybody out of it alone with no group members?

20
00:02:25,160 --> 00:02:31,220
Okay, good. All right. So what we're going to do today is we're going to intersperse the lecture with the group work.

21
00:02:31,340 --> 00:02:33,590
So as we go, we'll work on the group for questions.

22
00:02:34,460 --> 00:02:41,780
So we talked about this a little bit last time of all of these different estimates of the burden of cancer and the life,

23
00:02:41,780 --> 00:02:46,190
the probability, the lifetime probability of developing cancer was higher for men than for women.

24
00:02:47,210 --> 00:02:51,020
And that there were a lot of people who are living with cancer.

25
00:02:51,020 --> 00:02:54,649
Right. So it's quite prevalent at this point. And so here's a question for you.

26
00:02:54,650 --> 00:03:00,300
Do you think we're really trying to cure cancer? We always have.

27
00:03:00,310 --> 00:03:05,790
We have Run for the Cure, a race for the Cure. We're going to find it along the route somewhere.

28
00:03:05,790 --> 00:03:09,780
I think there was like some sort of like funny article about like the McSweeney's or something about that,

29
00:03:10,260 --> 00:03:13,350
but or an Onion article about finding the cure along the route.

30
00:03:13,350 --> 00:03:19,100
But I mean, is that the goal? Or is that what we're really accomplishing for most people?

31
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:29,550
I see heads shaking. What would you say then? I guess we're just prolonging the life as much as we can.

32
00:03:29,820 --> 00:03:34,559
Yeah. So I would say that rather than curing, I mean, for the lucky patient, yes.

33
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:37,660
If you catch it early and you do surgery and it's successful, you can cure people.

34
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:42,450
But I would say that for many patients, what ends up happening is that you're trying to.

35
00:03:43,820 --> 00:03:49,310
Holby can't stave the cancer off and provide that person with quality of life, and especially if they're quite elderly,

36
00:03:49,700 --> 00:03:54,840
you know, maybe they'll die of something else before the cancer really kind of roars back and becomes clinically important.

37
00:03:54,890 --> 00:03:59,030
Right. So a lot of cancer treatment, particularly not for super early stage,

38
00:03:59,030 --> 00:04:05,070
but for later stage cancers at this point ends up being sort of treating it as if it's like a chronic disease, right.

39
00:04:05,090 --> 00:04:11,720
That someone is living with, but making it so that it doesn't take their life or make their life not worth living.

40
00:04:11,730 --> 00:04:17,870
Right. You know, we have a great economic burden of cancer.

41
00:04:17,870 --> 00:04:22,609
It's very costly. The economic cost of cancer exceeds that of any other disease.

42
00:04:22,610 --> 00:04:25,549
Right. So we're spending the other kind of big one,

43
00:04:25,550 --> 00:04:31,310
that big cause of death or a big cause of chronic disease that we often talk about is heart disease or cardiovascular disease.

44
00:04:31,310 --> 00:04:37,310
Right. But heart disease is 753 billion, whereas we're spending 895 billion on cancer.

45
00:04:37,880 --> 00:04:43,400
Right. But the cost of reducing exposure to key factors is quite small.

46
00:04:43,410 --> 00:04:50,390
So I would argue that curing cancer is much less effective than preventing cancer.

47
00:04:50,630 --> 00:04:58,430
Right. So a lot of what we talk about in this class is about primary prevention or risk factors that we know exist for cancer.

48
00:04:58,430 --> 00:05:04,700
And that's why I think trying to identify modifiable risk factors for cancer is a very good strategy.

49
00:05:04,710 --> 00:05:09,290
Right, because it's much less costly and more effective.

50
00:05:09,290 --> 00:05:13,970
Right. When somebody has cancer, treatment for cancer is kind of uniformly no fun.

51
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:20,270
Right? Even if you're doing surgery and catching it early, it's still has meaningful consequences for a person's quality of life.

52
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:26,370
All right. So these are slightly older numbers. These are from 2021.

53
00:05:26,370 --> 00:05:30,690
I will post on the new slides, the ones from 2022, but it's basically the same.

54
00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:36,930
Certainly the ranking is the same. And we talked a little bit last time about what we thought of these numbers.

55
00:05:37,860 --> 00:05:43,530
And so first, we're going to talk about mortality. So what factors influence cancer mortality?

56
00:05:44,820 --> 00:05:51,090
What influences whether people are dying of a certain cancer? Yeah.

57
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:55,049
Age. Age. Absolutely, yes. So risk factors, right?

58
00:05:55,050 --> 00:05:59,220
Prevalence of risk factors in the population, age being kind of the number one risk factor.

59
00:06:00,990 --> 00:06:05,490
Yeah. Gender. Gender, for sure. Yep.

60
00:06:05,790 --> 00:06:12,330
Comorbidities. Mm hmm. Yes. So you can be a healthy person with cancer and do a lot better with the treatment, for example?

61
00:06:12,750 --> 00:06:16,250
Yes. Where? On the body for cancer or something? Yeah.

62
00:06:16,260 --> 00:06:21,330
The site of the cancer, for sure. The stage at which stage of diagnosis.

63
00:06:22,770 --> 00:06:27,390
Functional stuff. Yep. I think that goes along with co-morbidities for sure.

64
00:06:27,660 --> 00:06:32,070
Kind of the idea is the same, right? But if you're. If you're very sickly.

65
00:06:33,320 --> 00:06:35,900
You're not going to tolerate the treatment very well or have a good outcome.

66
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:40,500
So a lot of what you guys have talked about are factors that influence incidents.

67
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:44,940
Right. So cancers that are going to have a higher mortality are obviously going to be those that are more common.

68
00:06:47,580 --> 00:06:51,310
The availability of early diagnosis plus effective treatment, right?

69
00:06:51,330 --> 00:06:58,290
So the cancers that have the best prognosis are generally those for which we have an effective screening test.

70
00:06:58,710 --> 00:07:06,050
Right. And then etiologic factors that influence cancer progression and metastasis.

71
00:07:06,060 --> 00:07:08,970
So we talked that you talked about factors that influence incidence,

72
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:15,990
but there are some factors that may also influence that incidence, but they also cause an existing tumor to progress.

73
00:07:16,620 --> 00:07:22,109
What if you've got a cancer? But it stayed tiny and never grew and never metastasized?

74
00:07:22,110 --> 00:07:25,639
Would you care? No, because that's not what kills you, right?

75
00:07:25,640 --> 00:07:28,730
A tiny stage one, cancer that never goes anywhere. It becomes anything.

76
00:07:29,700 --> 00:07:35,900
It's not really a concern. So what if there are particular factors that you knew?

77
00:07:36,930 --> 00:07:41,790
If you had a tiny tumor, if you weren't exposed to those factors, it wouldn't actually progress.

78
00:07:43,050 --> 00:07:51,060
So there are some risk factors for progression and metastasis of cancer, not just initiation of a new tumor.

79
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:58,230
And then, of course, we always have to think about as epidemiologists, we always have to be skeptical.

80
00:07:58,530 --> 00:08:01,740
Right. Is it real or is it not real?

81
00:08:02,910 --> 00:08:09,240
What if you changed how you did death registration? So you saw big differences between one year and the next year in like who died of cancer?

82
00:08:09,510 --> 00:08:13,680
What if it was a change in the way you actually recorded cancer deaths?

83
00:08:14,890 --> 00:08:18,520
Probably not as much of an issue in developed countries.

84
00:08:18,760 --> 00:08:24,490
Right. But in developing countries who are who are developing their death registration systems.

85
00:08:24,910 --> 00:08:33,610
You could have a huge jump one year in cancer deaths and it wouldn't be real in the sense that a bunch of new people were suddenly dying from cancer.

86
00:08:33,620 --> 00:08:37,360
You're just actually counting them correctly, right? So think about that, too.

87
00:08:37,750 --> 00:08:40,450
And when we start looking at these maps of, like, global cancer,

88
00:08:40,450 --> 00:08:46,750
next time we're going to talk a little bit about how differences in the way cancer is recorded and

89
00:08:47,620 --> 00:08:53,710
differences in surveillance for cancer across countries can actually change the way cancer rates appear.

90
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:58,390
Like if you have two countries that are right next to each other and they have vastly different cancer rates.

91
00:09:02,050 --> 00:09:05,140
You wonder, right? Is there something?

92
00:09:05,140 --> 00:09:11,860
Could be right. Two countries right next to each other could be very different from each other, but also maybe not, right?

93
00:09:11,860 --> 00:09:16,720
It could just be that the way that they count cancers or the quality of the cancer registries are different.

94
00:09:17,500 --> 00:09:24,670
So we always want to be skeptical about that. Diseases are really bad at observing manmade borders.

95
00:09:25,330 --> 00:09:32,500
So when you see that diseases are really nicely observing manmade borders and are very different from one manmade border to another,

96
00:09:32,740 --> 00:09:36,850
you start to think it's something about the way we're counting them, not necessarily something real.

97
00:09:36,970 --> 00:09:41,810
Does that make sense? All right.

98
00:09:42,050 --> 00:09:48,260
So let's go to question one on the. Assignment.

99
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:59,209
So if you go to today. You should see a link to the US cancer and class exercise and if you click on that there is

100
00:09:59,210 --> 00:10:04,150
a word document here that you will be able to download and everybody cross your fingers.

101
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:09,020
I looked yesterday, so this is an interesting class to teach at this time of year because every year in early January,

102
00:10:09,380 --> 00:10:13,730
the American Cancer Society updates their cancer facts and figures for the next year.

103
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:17,150
Yes, it's one that is very weird.

104
00:10:18,100 --> 00:10:26,900
I don't get that. That's strange. Okay, let me see. In Classic.

105
00:10:34,590 --> 00:10:42,220
I'm very glad we can, but I wasn't directly on the little dot.

106
00:10:42,230 --> 00:10:45,560
I clicked like four times married, and it didn't actually work. There you go.

107
00:10:45,590 --> 00:10:49,910
That should work. Okay.

108
00:10:49,940 --> 00:10:53,090
So. And now we'll see if the Americans.

109
00:10:53,130 --> 00:10:59,100
So every year around this time of year, the American Cancer Society updates their cancer facts and figures like with usually.

110
00:10:59,370 --> 00:11:05,190
So now in January of 2023, they would update it, projecting the expected cases and deaths for 2023.

111
00:11:05,520 --> 00:11:11,220
So I always have to go right before a class like the day or two before and check in like do I have to update the exercise?

112
00:11:11,520 --> 00:11:15,490
Have they updated facts and figures? They had not when I checked like a day ago.

113
00:11:15,510 --> 00:11:20,790
So if they've done it since then, we're just going to go back and do it with 2022 data because I did my best.

114
00:11:22,920 --> 00:11:34,830
Okay. So there are a lot of refresher canvas accounts of 5050.

115
00:11:35,830 --> 00:11:38,900
Sorry. Yeah. Okay.

116
00:11:38,910 --> 00:11:46,620
So some people are able to do it. Okay. So if at least one person in the group can can get the questions, then they can be the record keeper.

117
00:11:46,710 --> 00:11:51,210
Okay. Yeah. Okay.

118
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:55,190
Okay. Let me see if we can. So about ten, 15 minutes to go through this part.

119
00:11:55,690 --> 00:11:59,250
Oh, sure. And I'll come around and help you with your questions.

120
00:12:00,680 --> 00:12:03,960
You guys are doing the Google Drive? Yeah.

121
00:12:04,930 --> 00:12:10,360
Are you guys able to open it or. Yeah. I mean, Viagra.

122
00:12:10,470 --> 00:12:15,790
I think it's like something. I was there. I'm not doing it in person.

123
00:12:15,810 --> 00:12:31,170
I mean, I usually can act on this stuff. Or do you remember the know my older brother and sister record?

124
00:12:31,170 --> 00:12:38,969
Because it's sort of the past. But I think they didn't know where this time.

125
00:12:38,970 --> 00:12:49,680
For some reason you guys can because I guess that's where I'm at.

126
00:12:50,310 --> 00:12:53,480
Has it pretty good. You've gotten at least one person who can download. Yeah.

127
00:12:54,210 --> 00:12:57,450
So they'll have to take on this. We have to just.

128
00:12:58,920 --> 00:13:07,380
Did you already know how to do it or what?

129
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:10,920
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

130
00:13:12,450 --> 00:13:19,080
Well, why don't you do it? And then we a download for verify it somewhere.

131
00:13:21,240 --> 00:13:25,890
So at the download for the powerpoint is a little bit hidden. It's like way down at the bottom of the page.

132
00:13:29,670 --> 00:13:32,969
So like if you go to the shouldn't be the hard part.

133
00:13:32,970 --> 00:13:41,190
So I'm going to show you go to research and then cancer facts and figures 20 Download PowerPoint Cancer Statistics 2022.

134
00:13:41,550 --> 00:13:52,860
Yeah, I think it's you actually have to go to see your current facts and figures so you click on that and they have not updated to 2023.

135
00:13:52,860 --> 00:13:59,819
So I did it. So this is the big PDF, this like the whole it's like lots and lots of words and tables and tons of numbers.

136
00:13:59,820 --> 00:14:05,070
That's like the full saying. I think it's the same thing. But if you go way down here, download PowerPoint.

137
00:14:05,550 --> 00:14:13,740
This is like the the most commonly used slides. And it's good to know about this because you can these are here so that you can use them.

138
00:14:14,220 --> 00:14:19,950
So like you will see people give presentations about cancer and like the little these slides are in their presentation,

139
00:14:19,950 --> 00:14:23,980
the beginning of like the background, right. Or you'll see those are men and women.

140
00:14:24,090 --> 00:14:28,229
But because of everybody's project, which is I think is one of the PowerPoint.

141
00:14:28,230 --> 00:14:34,170
So sorry, I say research, I just want to go by the slides that are on there.

142
00:14:34,170 --> 00:14:37,700
But if you just like control think it's just phrases.

143
00:14:38,830 --> 00:14:44,010
Yeah. That's the whole.

144
00:14:44,750 --> 00:14:49,350
No, no. Yeah, that's right.

145
00:14:49,560 --> 00:14:52,870
Okay. Oh, I see.

146
00:14:53,220 --> 00:14:58,650
I see. Yeah. Okay.

147
00:14:59,740 --> 00:15:03,850
All right. Well, yes, the question is if like my friends or something.

148
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:12,450
So I didn't travel to find out for those first few paragraphs.

149
00:15:12,460 --> 00:15:27,410
And I think it's just it's just kind of like, you know, he's lying there for the bigger difference.

150
00:15:28,150 --> 00:15:33,380
So I just thought you can smell the water.

151
00:15:34,420 --> 00:15:37,540
Yeah, cause we decided to have a female.

152
00:15:37,570 --> 00:15:54,129
Yeah, yeah, I'm out of my house, and it's just an entrance of asking what you're saying is one of the more interesting age.

153
00:15:54,130 --> 00:15:57,310
Adjusted. Adjusted three.

154
00:15:57,640 --> 00:16:02,470
Since I think it's weird when you're searching, why are you here?

155
00:16:02,920 --> 00:16:07,630
Because it might not be uploaded as tax avoidance pictures.

156
00:16:10,500 --> 00:16:17,260
So I tried searching like the words, and if nothing comes out, then they don't bother because.

157
00:16:19,870 --> 00:16:23,290
Yeah, I think there's something there. Yeah.

158
00:16:23,910 --> 00:16:36,490
It's because sometimes they're more often state type of adjustment is 2500 inches PowerPoint.

159
00:16:36,910 --> 00:16:51,040
I hope so. Just keep scrolling down and start Republicans.

160
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:55,899
No sense in this one, but it's just I can't find anything, I think.

161
00:16:55,900 --> 00:17:06,940
So what happens is when I read that was where they were wondering like whether it's in direct or indirect generated.

162
00:17:10,330 --> 00:17:14,020
So we're only doing. Question one eighth. Rudy, the mortality.

163
00:17:14,020 --> 00:17:18,730
Question So when you're done with question one, you don't go on to question too.

164
00:17:19,840 --> 00:17:22,030
Yeah. So just, just looking at background.

165
00:17:24,710 --> 00:17:36,280
So the biggest change is like there's a drop in the decline and one of my answer are, well, I just kind of figure something different.

166
00:17:37,210 --> 00:18:01,200
Yeah, I guess I just wasn't sure what that program should be or like, if you think I'm searching for you, speak with me in refrigeration.

167
00:18:01,450 --> 00:18:04,810
Maybe you can also say difference.

168
00:18:04,870 --> 00:18:14,770
But I guess the thing that's really interesting, look at how quickly like see that?

169
00:18:15,890 --> 00:18:21,190
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

170
00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:30,100
I'm happy to like. No, it was unfortunate. I know that was too many looking at my school yearbook.

171
00:18:30,730 --> 00:18:42,670
So it looks like. Yeah. And then I'll have the power of the video to tell them.

172
00:18:43,900 --> 00:18:48,400
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

173
00:18:48,490 --> 00:18:53,770
So I prefer to hide things. I'm telling you right now as on the 29th.

174
00:18:53,990 --> 00:18:59,950
Yeah. We'll be doing our when they're already on the paradigm.

175
00:19:00,030 --> 00:19:06,920
Just don't really know.

176
00:19:06,980 --> 00:19:15,040
Okay we're going to go to school and I would be interested her.

177
00:19:15,580 --> 00:19:27,460
Oh my gosh, I could say that I guess they are very effective use of the word adjusted EBITDA and adjusted to them in 2005.

178
00:19:27,820 --> 00:19:45,730
But it's only one of the things that I use is going to be used as a for each type of cancer,

179
00:19:46,510 --> 00:19:54,550
I think because what they're doing is saying, I mean, it's just going to kind of.

180
00:19:56,100 --> 00:20:02,520
They're using the US population saving diagnoses saying they're really like they're keeping their race.

181
00:20:02,610 --> 00:20:09,540
Are you saying that none of the male flight is actually you're talking to me with anybody.

182
00:20:11,470 --> 00:20:17,060
Anything in my mind is male. There's nothing here.

183
00:20:17,460 --> 00:20:20,880
So these are reasons which I was. Don't worry.

184
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:25,890
I was going to be as I was saying, I was reading glasses and my brain.

185
00:20:25,890 --> 00:20:31,950
I was just switching, not to be present some random thoughts and ignore them.

186
00:20:34,410 --> 00:20:44,250
Everything else is really. Yeah. I wonder if it has to do with drinking or with liver and kidney decreases or and that probably goes on.

187
00:20:44,310 --> 00:20:53,310
But we talked about the popularity of Cigarets and they're like more likely because

188
00:20:53,310 --> 00:20:59,160
we started knowing cigarets bad and smoke and then another thought like cancer and.

189
00:21:00,930 --> 00:21:01,260
Yeah.

190
00:21:01,380 --> 00:21:10,140
I don't know maybe like people are upset about it for raising hepatitis and doing a single similar than they would be more likely to get cancers.

191
00:21:10,170 --> 00:21:14,909
Yeah. Yeah. And the three other countries too.

192
00:21:14,910 --> 00:21:20,000
So yeah. You can notice the rise and fall, but you also notice that of other cancers.

193
00:21:20,010 --> 00:21:31,080
How many people are on one? See, still, when D says Please come and two changes need to be done for 25 women to do a screening.

194
00:21:31,230 --> 00:21:34,500
Okay. They all go down to that.

195
00:21:34,890 --> 00:21:41,520
Some a number of these to lower ones kind of increase every time I go to the doctor.

196
00:21:41,530 --> 00:21:44,940
Just liver is kind of weird. Yeah, I'm afraid so.

197
00:21:45,990 --> 00:21:51,150
Everyone identified like Dr. Gloria better, and I thought, yeah, correct.

198
00:21:51,270 --> 00:22:03,350
I think I just feel like at least now you are able to surgically repaired or yeah.

199
00:22:03,530 --> 00:22:15,509
You find, I mean before posteriors or any sort of alternative way to screen just like it is going to happen.

200
00:22:15,510 --> 00:22:22,560
He said it was going to be working on your liver validated.

201
00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:28,790
The figures are coming and I think that is.

202
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:39,989
Yeah. I don't know. I mean, maybe those are two specific things.

203
00:22:39,990 --> 00:22:57,010
I mean, good reputation, cancer mortality has been increasing recently, which to cancer incidence increase is not as strong.

204
00:22:59,270 --> 00:23:16,200
Yeah, it's it's really it's really it's really hard to tell when you're looking at those, you know, delivered by other kids or something like that.

205
00:23:16,790 --> 00:23:29,919
I do like that, but there's nothing wrong with them.

206
00:23:29,920 --> 00:23:41,069
And I do think it's interesting to them doesn't show as much of your kind of you kind of have to be it for women.

207
00:23:41,070 --> 00:23:54,660
It seemed like it had a much drastic maybe it's become more popular drinking easier and that has produced during the period of the explosion.

208
00:23:57,390 --> 00:24:05,360
And so I don't imagine that side screening hepatitis or treatment revolution.

209
00:24:06,900 --> 00:24:10,889
I think there's something. All right. Let's go ahead and talk through this.

210
00:24:10,890 --> 00:24:14,100
If you didn't get all the way through, that's fine, because we're going to go through it together.

211
00:24:14,310 --> 00:24:19,230
So we all found that PowerPoint presentation, right?

212
00:24:19,230 --> 00:24:27,510
So that's super useful. I was starting to say earlier because you can just download that and use it so it is for you to use.

213
00:24:27,510 --> 00:24:35,969
So if you are doing a, for example, a presentation about a cancer in some class, you know,

214
00:24:35,970 --> 00:24:40,740
hypothetically and you needed some slides about the background like the incidence

215
00:24:40,740 --> 00:24:44,430
and prevalence of your cancer and how likely it was to cause mortality.

216
00:24:44,430 --> 00:24:46,319
You might want to use some of these slides, right?

217
00:24:46,320 --> 00:24:51,809
If you were going to try to describe the epidemiology of a particular cancer, you could take these and use them with attribution.

218
00:24:51,810 --> 00:24:54,750
Of course, she would say it's from the American Cancer Society. Right. But it's.

219
00:24:54,870 --> 00:25:00,450
It's put into a PowerPoint to make it really easy for you to just kind of gank those and put them in your own presentation.

220
00:25:00,460 --> 00:25:03,100
That's what they're for. So totally acceptable to do that.

221
00:25:03,390 --> 00:25:09,360
You will see those little men and women slides a million times in people's presentations because they're for that.

222
00:25:09,360 --> 00:25:14,400
Right. No one wants to reinvent the wheel. And the ACLU has done a lovely job of making these kinds of slides for us.

223
00:25:15,270 --> 00:25:22,139
Okay. So we were supposed to look at slide actually 14 trends in cancer death rates among males.

224
00:25:22,140 --> 00:25:26,640
And so I asked for what years the mortality information is available.

225
00:25:27,870 --> 00:25:33,899
So it's a pretty easy question. Who wants to answer that one? 1930, 2019.

226
00:25:33,900 --> 00:25:38,700
Yeah, 1930 to 2019. And you're going to compare this with incidents because it's going to be a bit different.

227
00:25:38,970 --> 00:25:44,940
The incidents dates are going to be different. We've we've had mortality data collected in this country for a lot longer.

228
00:25:45,210 --> 00:25:49,500
I will say, though, that the mortality data lags a little bit more than the incidence data.

229
00:25:49,730 --> 00:25:53,100
Okay. So it's through like 2019 at this point.

230
00:25:53,140 --> 00:25:59,190
Okay. So not super up to not exactly up to date, a couple of years lagged, but there you go.

231
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:07,770
All right. And so then I think I also asked you what statistic is presented and is it adjusted for anything?

232
00:26:09,480 --> 00:26:16,020
So what did you guys see here? Yes and yes, the cancer death rates among males adjusted for age.

233
00:26:16,170 --> 00:26:19,380
Yes, cancer death rates per 100,000 population.

234
00:26:19,800 --> 00:26:24,610
Adjusted for age, you will almost never see crude rates presented for cancer.

235
00:26:24,630 --> 00:26:30,150
It almost doesn't make any sense to do it because cancer, the number one risk factor for cancer is age.

236
00:26:30,420 --> 00:26:35,100
We know that it's not interesting. So we always kind of want to adjust for age, right.

237
00:26:35,100 --> 00:26:40,799
And so if you have looked at 1930 versus today, the age structure of the U.S. population was quite different in 1930.

238
00:26:40,800 --> 00:26:45,480
Right. So if you did not adjust for age, it would not be a fair comparison, right?

239
00:26:45,480 --> 00:26:48,719
So we almost always will adjust for age.

240
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:53,100
When presenting statistics for cancer, you're almost never going to see anything not adjusted.

241
00:26:53,430 --> 00:27:00,990
Okay. So then I think the next question I asked you was, what are the biggest changes you notice and what are some hypotheses you have about that?

242
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:02,280
So what did you guys say here?

243
00:27:05,400 --> 00:27:17,110
There's not a huge increase for the lung cancer rates starting around the peaks around 1990, yet from one 1995 ish and it starts decreasing rapidly.

244
00:27:17,130 --> 00:27:23,670
Yeah. And what's your hypothesis about that? It was was it like, well, the cigaret like propaganda stuff.

245
00:27:23,690 --> 00:27:29,700
Yeah, 100%. Yeah. So cigaret, if you remember from our introduction and we're going to get in our smoking lecture,

246
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:36,120
but the per capita use of cigarets makes that exact same peak and trough,

247
00:27:36,120 --> 00:27:42,029
and then the lung cancer death rates and incidence rates mirror it or lag it by about ten, 20 years.

248
00:27:42,030 --> 00:27:56,610
Yeah. So, you know, I think someone especially like in places like L.A. or yeah, yeah, it's really hard to.

249
00:27:57,510 --> 00:28:01,500
So when you have such an enormous risk factor for something,

250
00:28:02,370 --> 00:28:10,050
it's very difficult to then like what population would you want if you wanted to establish that air pollution was causing lung cancer?

251
00:28:10,470 --> 00:28:13,950
Who would you study? Can you think about that? Like, who would you want to pick?

252
00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:21,980
I mean, children get picked, people who are exposed as kids and look at what they were exposed to as children or,

253
00:28:22,520 --> 00:28:27,560
you know, you might want to look in nonsmokers, but.

254
00:28:28,820 --> 00:28:33,410
The prevalence of lung cancer in nonsmokers is really low, right.

255
00:28:33,830 --> 00:28:39,590
So it's really hard. It's very difficult to disentangle smoking from lung cancer.

256
00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:43,730
It's such an overwhelmingly huge risk factor and it's still a fairly prevalent exposure.

257
00:28:44,150 --> 00:28:49,340
Right. So it's really, really difficult. The other thing, too, is like if you want to look at people who are having cancer today,

258
00:28:49,340 --> 00:28:52,700
when would you want to know about their air pollution exposure in their lifetime?

259
00:28:56,970 --> 00:29:00,270
Okay. When they. I mean, when they were younger.

260
00:29:00,270 --> 00:29:03,929
How much younger? I don't know. Like, would you want to look when they were in their thirties?

261
00:29:03,930 --> 00:29:07,920
Would you want to look when they were? When is that an important window of exposure for lung cancer?

262
00:29:08,250 --> 00:29:10,379
The answer is we don't supernormal. Right.

263
00:29:10,380 --> 00:29:17,580
But it's not where they live right now and it's not what they want, what their air pollution exposure is right now when they're sick.

264
00:29:17,790 --> 00:29:21,060
Right. It's probably something. 20 years ago.

265
00:29:21,120 --> 00:29:27,569
30 years ago. I don't know. Right. So that's this is one of the challenges that we're going to come up against a lot in this class.

266
00:29:27,570 --> 00:29:35,760
Thinking about studying cancer. Right. Is when do you want to assess exposure in relation to the disease?

267
00:29:35,760 --> 00:29:42,150
Because it has a really long period of development and it's hard, it's a really hard question.

268
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:50,070
And then getting that data is going to be a nightmare. So, yes, I would bet you that air pollution contributes.

269
00:29:51,440 --> 00:29:57,139
To what extent is very difficult to determine because it's really hard to study

270
00:29:57,140 --> 00:30:02,210
anything that isn't smoking and lung cancer unless you study it in nonsmokers.

271
00:30:03,470 --> 00:30:08,570
Then as a confounder, you would have to assess their exposure to secondhand smoke, which is extremely difficult to do.

272
00:30:09,830 --> 00:30:14,209
And it's it's kind of a nightmare to study. It's really a messy game.

273
00:30:14,210 --> 00:30:18,770
Absolutely. But I would guess that, yes, there's probably some association, right?

274
00:30:21,050 --> 00:30:25,040
What else? Lung cancer was sort of the big red elephant in the room here.

275
00:30:25,070 --> 00:30:32,990
What else do you see? Yeah. Our groups pointed out the decrease in stomach cancer death rates and really drastic decrease.

276
00:30:33,560 --> 00:30:40,520
And one of the reasons, just reading the caption, was the results of refrigeration and lower intake and sodium processed foods.

277
00:30:40,760 --> 00:30:46,700
Yes, that's probably part of it. Right. So like sodium preserved foods are bad grade because so in cancer, we know that that's a carcinogen.

278
00:30:47,180 --> 00:30:52,340
What's another thing that causes stomach cancer? Do you guys know offhand of another big risk factor for stomach cancer?

279
00:30:53,570 --> 00:31:00,190
H. Pylori What is that viral bacterial goodness?

280
00:31:00,290 --> 00:31:04,130
You got it. The third time's a charm. Yes, it's a bacteria.

281
00:31:04,310 --> 00:31:07,370
So we didn't know that it caused stomach cancer.

282
00:31:07,370 --> 00:31:12,529
But what did we all start taking in about 1945? Pretty heavily antibiotics.

283
00:31:12,530 --> 00:31:15,979
Right? So if you start taking antibiotics for everything else, you're probably going to kill off a lot of H.

284
00:31:15,980 --> 00:31:20,470
Pylori. I bet that's another kind of incidental reason.

285
00:31:20,580 --> 00:31:25,610
I would think. Anything else? Yeah.

286
00:31:25,610 --> 00:31:32,210
We mentioned the decrease in colorectal. Just better screening and surgical treatment options becoming available.

287
00:31:33,430 --> 00:31:37,469
Screening is a big one, I would say, especially since you see it start to really come down in the early eighties.

288
00:31:37,470 --> 00:31:44,040
I think that's I don't know offhand. When they instituted colonoscopies, I would bet a lot of those kinds of things started in the late eighties.

289
00:31:44,550 --> 00:31:48,930
Mammography was around excuse me, early eighties. Mammography was around then, too.

290
00:31:49,500 --> 00:31:53,430
So I would guess that that sort of screening related. Absolutely. Yeah.

291
00:31:54,630 --> 00:32:03,240
Great observations. Um. And then we highlighted two cancers whose mortality had been increasing recently.

292
00:32:03,690 --> 00:32:07,130
And that was in the pancreas and liver and bile duct.

293
00:32:07,140 --> 00:32:18,270
What did you guys think could be some reasons for that? Recent diet changes for consumers on saturated fats and sugar, I think could be dietary.

294
00:32:21,310 --> 00:32:30,370
Could it be exposure to hepatitis C like people in their sixties when they were younger and it was never treated returning to everything.

295
00:32:30,850 --> 00:32:35,649
It could be we now have a vaccine for hepatitis B, so and so.

296
00:32:35,650 --> 00:32:40,460
We should be starting to see the effects of that on liver cancer. One thing.

297
00:32:40,480 --> 00:32:44,530
So hepatitis C also, I don't know. I have to tell you, I'm really sorry.

298
00:32:44,530 --> 00:32:50,620
When we get to the infection lecture, all of the viruses associated with cancer start with an H and they all rhyme.

299
00:32:50,630 --> 00:32:54,450
It's HPV, HPV, HCV. It's horrible. Like I didn't name them.

300
00:32:54,460 --> 00:32:55,060
It's not my fault.

301
00:32:55,060 --> 00:32:59,290
But every time I give that lecture, I'm like, I'm just going to say the wrong one, I'm sure, because they're all like the same sound.

302
00:32:59,740 --> 00:33:07,570
But hepatitis C does not have a vaccine, but it would have to be something that was increasing in prevalence over time.

303
00:33:07,630 --> 00:33:11,440
Right. Because the the the mortality is increasing.

304
00:33:11,740 --> 00:33:13,149
So would have to be something that's going up.

305
00:33:13,150 --> 00:33:20,020
So you have to ask yourself, do you think that the prevalence of those viruses is increasing and therefore accounting for the increase in mortality?

306
00:33:20,500 --> 00:33:27,150
Sorry, I think I didn't say correctly like so for people who have hep C and then it was never treated.

307
00:33:27,180 --> 00:33:31,750
His treatment was really expensive and then it devolved into liver cancer.

308
00:33:31,970 --> 00:33:35,130
Yep. Like now because it took so long that like chronic C.

309
00:33:35,170 --> 00:33:41,379
Yeah, but again, it would have to be that the hep C was increasing like the prevalence of hep C was increasing at some point,

310
00:33:41,380 --> 00:33:46,260
which is now causing like increasing or you're saying treatment was decreasing because it was expensive.

311
00:33:46,540 --> 00:33:50,110
Yeah. Like, you know, and that could be that could be that makes sense.

312
00:33:51,460 --> 00:34:00,050
Yes. There's also some thought with the viruses, too, that there are people who we are having increased immigration from endemic areas like.

313
00:34:00,070 --> 00:34:06,220
So for example, a lot you do see a lot of increase of this increase is on kind of like the southern border states.

314
00:34:06,550 --> 00:34:14,920
So we do have increasing immigration from Mexico, Central America, those kinds of places where vaccination wasn't as common.

315
00:34:15,190 --> 00:34:20,709
And so if people who weren't vaccinated were infected and the prevalence of the infection is higher.

316
00:34:20,710 --> 00:34:25,060
So if people were coming from those places, you could expect if immigration was increasing,

317
00:34:25,060 --> 00:34:29,440
which it was over this time period, you could expect to have more liver cancer cases.

318
00:34:29,440 --> 00:34:35,170
So that's a piece of it potentially. Right. It's not maybe the whole answer, but it is a potential piece of that puzzle.

319
00:34:37,180 --> 00:34:42,280
It could be medications. So, again, increasing medications.

320
00:34:42,820 --> 00:34:46,030
Oh, you're thinking that there's some sort of medication could be causing liver cancer?

321
00:34:46,460 --> 00:34:46,710
Yes.

322
00:34:46,760 --> 00:35:00,490
Like, for example, I know that some of the, uh, for high blood pressure medication maybe that's an interesting that type of patient is increasing.

323
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:05,710
That's interesting. That could be. I know some people brought up alcohol use.

324
00:35:07,060 --> 00:35:09,400
It would have to have increased over time.

325
00:35:10,730 --> 00:35:18,530
In the timeframe that would cause cancer now, she says, saying so, like if this increase started in 1990, it would have to be,

326
00:35:18,530 --> 00:35:23,030
what, like 20, maybe 20 years before that, ten years before that, that alcohol use was really increasing.

327
00:35:23,030 --> 00:35:30,590
So that's potentially a thing, right? So what you see here is that these kinds of data,

328
00:35:30,950 --> 00:35:36,080
really high quality surveillance data about cancer mortality and as we'll see in the next question, incidence.

329
00:35:37,040 --> 00:35:41,779
Provide you with data that cause you to start looking at hypotheses.

330
00:35:41,780 --> 00:35:45,769
Right. There have been studies on all of these things that you have brought up, right.

331
00:35:45,770 --> 00:35:50,149
Because people are investigating these as potential causes of this increase.

332
00:35:50,150 --> 00:35:54,320
So when you start to see an increase in the population, then you start to wonder why is that happening?

333
00:35:54,650 --> 00:36:03,410
And it can lead you to research questions. Yeah. When they make adjustments to like look at these trends, do they also adjust for life expectancy?

334
00:36:04,760 --> 00:36:10,409
Or like, how would that be? Like, how would you start? So what do you mean adjust for life expectancy?

335
00:36:10,410 --> 00:36:15,110
So like or I guess I don't know what you're talking about, a competing a potential competing resource issue.

336
00:36:15,410 --> 00:36:22,530
No, they're not doing that. But that is also something to think about.

337
00:36:22,560 --> 00:36:26,970
So you're thinking if people are dying less of heart disease, maybe they're around long enough now to live.

338
00:36:27,120 --> 00:36:32,370
Mm hmm. Potentially. Although I think the adjustment takes care of some of that.

339
00:36:34,980 --> 00:36:38,840
Mathematically. But yeah, that's something to think about for sure. Yeah.

340
00:36:38,850 --> 00:36:46,200
So these kinds of statistics are really useful because they provide you with a lot of data that can be hypothesis generating.

341
00:36:46,530 --> 00:36:50,820
A lot of our research hypotheses come from looking at these data and things that have changed over time.

342
00:36:52,050 --> 00:36:58,020
Okay. And so that I think we looked at women. And I think note here, the scale is the same.

343
00:36:58,020 --> 00:37:02,450
It goes up to 100. But like the lung cancer never got as high as then.

344
00:37:02,460 --> 00:37:05,820
Right. Because the prevalence of smoking was never as high in women as it was in men.

345
00:37:06,630 --> 00:37:12,090
But you still see this through this. It's a little bit later because women started smoking a little bit later in time.

346
00:37:13,480 --> 00:37:16,719
I think men were, you know, really started smoking in the twenties or whatever.

347
00:37:16,720 --> 00:37:19,690
And then it kind of became more acceptable, socially acceptable for women,

348
00:37:19,690 --> 00:37:23,790
like during World War Two when they kind of started working outside the home and that kind of thing.

349
00:37:23,800 --> 00:37:28,740
Right? So. 1940s era is when women really kind of started picking up with more, with more smoking.

350
00:37:28,750 --> 00:37:34,030
I would to generalize. Right. But that's why you see the peek a bit later in women.

351
00:37:35,950 --> 00:37:37,840
Anything else you guys notice here for women?

352
00:37:38,500 --> 00:37:48,010
Yeah, there's it seems like the liver cancer death rates like, were much like decrease much faster for women than for minor.

353
00:37:48,010 --> 00:37:51,580
Like they had a more marked decrease, which I thought was kind of interesting.

354
00:37:52,990 --> 00:37:56,979
And I was wondering if that, like, maybe had something to do with alcohol use,

355
00:37:56,980 --> 00:38:01,120
which like maybe around the Great Depression era and like the Roaring Twenties.

356
00:38:01,120 --> 00:38:04,970
And then you go back into a lot of women working more in the home and stuff.

357
00:38:04,990 --> 00:38:09,399
Could be possibly. Possibly. Yeah. Those are good, good thoughts and answer.

358
00:38:09,400 --> 00:38:16,330
I don't know. Right. Like it could be. Totally. Could be. So there's something also.

359
00:38:18,300 --> 00:38:23,370
Correct me if I'm wrong. You may know anybody else, a medical doctor or a medical professional in here.

360
00:38:24,090 --> 00:38:28,970
Is there something about pregnancy and hepatitis B vaccination? Is that something that would be offered in there?

361
00:38:29,970 --> 00:38:35,370
Because that could be a reason. Like if women are more highly vaccinated, perhaps because they get it when they're pregnant, that could be.

362
00:38:36,450 --> 00:38:40,170
Right. I don't know if that's. There's like a tickle in the back of my mind about that.

363
00:38:40,380 --> 00:38:43,890
But I don't know if it's right. But that's another hypothesis, right? We can look into it.

364
00:38:44,730 --> 00:38:49,590
Anything else? You see another nice little breast cancer coming down?

365
00:38:51,310 --> 00:38:56,720
Mammography. Right, was introduced in the early eighties. Anything else?

366
00:38:57,980 --> 00:39:01,190
All right. So we'll keep on going then.

367
00:39:01,700 --> 00:39:07,360
Now I know. Okay. So I would like to point out here.

368
00:39:07,630 --> 00:39:09,660
So this is another different statistic.

369
00:39:09,670 --> 00:39:15,700
This is just the number of cases or excuse me, the number of cancer deaths among men and women shown separately.

370
00:39:16,060 --> 00:39:21,160
And so 2003, I remember, was like this huge year where everyone was so excited because,

371
00:39:21,160 --> 00:39:24,210
you know, the population has been kind of steadily aging over time, right?

372
00:39:24,220 --> 00:39:27,050
The proportion of older people has been increasing in our population.

373
00:39:27,730 --> 00:39:31,840
So you would expect the number of cancer deaths and the number of cancers to increase over time.

374
00:39:32,170 --> 00:39:41,590
2003 was the first year that it actually overall, the number of people dying of cancer decreased in the U.S. since 1930.

375
00:39:41,590 --> 00:39:45,790
When we started counting, it had literally been higher every year until 2003.

376
00:39:45,820 --> 00:39:49,840
So that was like the and a probably that was due to smoking, right?

377
00:39:49,840 --> 00:39:54,129
Smoking going down was the big reason why that would be lower, but it was like a big celebration,

378
00:39:54,130 --> 00:39:59,370
like, oh, we finally had a lower year for the first time in 70 years.

379
00:39:59,380 --> 00:40:06,850
So that was a big a big year. You know, there's this total number of cancer deaths averted from 1991 to 2017.

380
00:40:08,410 --> 00:40:16,899
The red. So the the blue is the actual cancer deaths that were observed and the red are the number of

381
00:40:16,900 --> 00:40:20,830
cancer deaths that would have been expected if the cancer death rates had remained at their peak.

382
00:40:21,310 --> 00:40:26,260
Right. So they're using the the peak rate and then projecting where the line would have gone.

383
00:40:26,650 --> 00:40:31,060
And so this is, you know, the progress that we made. So it's a way of kind of visualizing that progress.

384
00:40:32,260 --> 00:40:41,800
I do want to point out. So if you look at causes of death overall in the population, cancer is second only to heart disease.

385
00:40:42,250 --> 00:40:46,300
They're the two big ones. It's almost half the pie between those two.

386
00:40:47,470 --> 00:40:50,710
And heart disease just ekes out cancer in both men and in women.

387
00:40:51,220 --> 00:40:57,430
But I do want to point out, you know, this is the red line is the red bar is 1950 and the gray bar is 23.

388
00:40:57,820 --> 00:41:03,970
So if you look at that progress made between 1950 and 2003 for heart disease, that is enormous, right?

389
00:41:04,300 --> 00:41:10,960
Absolutely enormous. We have blood pressure medication like was mentioned, statins for lowering cholesterol.

390
00:41:11,470 --> 00:41:18,760
A lot of really good like surgeon changes in surgical technique with how we treat heart disease now.

391
00:41:18,760 --> 00:41:25,520
I mean, my grandfather in the early 1980s had a quadruple bypass and that man had his chest cracked open.

392
00:41:25,540 --> 00:41:29,760
He was cut from here down to his ankle and we had to check his toes.

393
00:41:29,770 --> 00:41:32,770
I remember, like when I was I was like tiny, right?

394
00:41:32,770 --> 00:41:37,000
But I remember running and be like, like, okay, you know, because we were supposed to check his toes to make sure they weren't blue.

395
00:41:38,440 --> 00:41:42,879
And now they, like, take you in and, like, go in through your neck and just put a little balloon in there.

396
00:41:42,880 --> 00:41:47,770
And it's basically almost an outpatient thing, right? Like, I think I mean, I think you stay a night or something like that, right?

397
00:41:47,770 --> 00:41:52,030
So it's totally improved, like vastly different the way we treat it.

398
00:41:52,360 --> 00:41:56,559
And the drugs that we've developed have really impacted the heart disease.

399
00:41:56,560 --> 00:41:59,560
Death rates done the same for stroke.

400
00:42:00,580 --> 00:42:07,510
Cancer. Now, this is a little bit misleading.

401
00:42:07,540 --> 00:42:12,309
We've improved some since 2003. Right. So we have made some progress.

402
00:42:12,310 --> 00:42:15,549
But it's nothing the progress that's been made in cardiovascular disease.

403
00:42:15,550 --> 00:42:19,050
So we still struggle with treating cancer.

404
00:42:19,060 --> 00:42:23,650
Like I said, our first line of treatment is still. Cut it out when it's small.

405
00:42:24,250 --> 00:42:28,870
Right. That's the best chance. We're working on other kinds of drug treatments.

406
00:42:29,140 --> 00:42:36,700
We've got chemo, we've got radiation. But, you know, the best the best chance is really not to get it because our treatments have not gotten.

407
00:42:37,940 --> 00:42:39,530
Hugely better the way they have.

408
00:42:39,560 --> 00:42:44,030
There really hasn't been this revolution in cancer treatment, I would say, the way there has been for cardiovascular disease.

409
00:42:45,650 --> 00:42:49,820
Um, you know, the stock drop in the U.S. cancer death rate really has been.

410
00:42:50,330 --> 00:42:55,970
Lung cancer and getting rid of smoking. Right. That has been kind of the biggest thing that we've been able to do.

411
00:42:58,720 --> 00:43:05,290
I would also show you here that the five year relative survival rates, if you look at all cancers, has gotten better.

412
00:43:06,010 --> 00:43:10,959
So the relative survival rate, again, is the the percentage of people who survived in five years compared to what you

413
00:43:10,960 --> 00:43:15,180
would expect the survival to be for their age and maybe for sex or something.

414
00:43:15,190 --> 00:43:19,210
Right. So, you know, we've made some improvement for all sites.

415
00:43:19,480 --> 00:43:25,360
The big improvements have really been for those things where we've gotten, you know, good.

416
00:43:27,140 --> 00:43:33,220
Good. Something. Let me see. Let me find a big one. Anybody see one where there's been a huge improvement?

417
00:43:38,110 --> 00:43:42,420
No, no, no. Yeah. That's a pretty good one.

418
00:43:43,230 --> 00:43:44,910
Melanoma has had a pretty big improvement.

419
00:43:45,300 --> 00:43:51,060
You know, so there's some where we've gotten good screening tests or where we've gotten some very targeted therapies.

420
00:43:51,480 --> 00:43:54,900
Right. But overall, you know, good progress, but not fantastic.

421
00:43:55,320 --> 00:44:04,740
I would like to point out, however, that racial disparities have remained and it remains for for all cancers and then also for individual cancers.

422
00:44:06,120 --> 00:44:15,770
You know, both white and black. People have had improvements in survival over time, but the black survival rate still remains lower than white.

423
00:44:20,830 --> 00:44:24,070
Stage at diagnosis is super important. We're going to talk about this next time.

424
00:44:25,780 --> 00:44:31,809
So, for example, the higher your relative survival rates by stage of diagnosis and this is for the most recent time period.

425
00:44:31,810 --> 00:44:34,960
So you can see, for example, breast looks pretty good overall, right?

426
00:44:35,440 --> 00:44:40,720
But if you look at those that are diagnosed at distant stage, 26%, five year relative survival rate.

427
00:44:41,730 --> 00:44:46,140
So where we've made this major improvement is that we're catching most this is this.

428
00:44:47,140 --> 00:44:53,020
Is a weighted average of all of these. So when you see that this 89% is much closer to the local and regional,

429
00:44:53,020 --> 00:44:56,620
that means that the vast majority of breast cancers are being diagnosed at those stages.

430
00:44:57,010 --> 00:45:00,250
Very few are being diagnosed at distant stages, but it's bad when they are.

431
00:45:00,670 --> 00:45:04,630
Let's look at ovary as a as a contrast.

432
00:45:05,200 --> 00:45:08,650
The overall survival rate is 46%. That is unacceptably low.

433
00:45:09,430 --> 00:45:14,820
Right. If it's caught at a local stage, though, the five year survival rate is 95%.

434
00:45:16,440 --> 00:45:20,250
That's 92. Sorry, that's a two. I can I can read numbers.

435
00:45:21,300 --> 00:45:27,840
That's a two 92%. Right. So that's really great. The problem is that almost all of them are being caught a distant stage.

436
00:45:28,290 --> 00:45:30,960
So your weighted average for all stages is pretty, pretty bad.

437
00:45:31,440 --> 00:45:36,240
Remember I told you pancreas is really bad and it's still really bad, even if it's not locally.

438
00:45:36,300 --> 00:45:42,090
Pancreas is one of those where, like, early detection might not be the answer unless you're actually catching it at a pre-cancerous stage.

439
00:45:42,750 --> 00:45:48,150
Right. That's going to have to be a treatment thing or prevention thing altogether, because even at the local stage, it's bad.

440
00:45:50,160 --> 00:45:53,550
So this is one more example of how cancer is not one disease.

441
00:45:54,830 --> 00:45:59,780
All right. So let's talk about what factors influence cancer incidence. Now, we talked about the things that influence mortality.

442
00:46:00,290 --> 00:46:05,600
We talked a bit about what influences incidence kind of because incidence influences mortality, right.

443
00:46:06,110 --> 00:46:09,140
But we've got obviously the prevalence of risk factors in the population.

444
00:46:12,210 --> 00:46:20,530
Hmm. You know, have we had some sort of change in an environmental risk or protective factor or a change in population susceptibility?

445
00:46:20,920 --> 00:46:24,910
How do we diagnose the cancer? Right. Because that can improve over time.

446
00:46:25,600 --> 00:46:31,090
So I have a hard time coming up with a cancer for which this has been a huge issue.

447
00:46:31,870 --> 00:46:36,190
Prostate is a good example, right, where we've really had an improvement.

448
00:46:36,250 --> 00:46:39,850
We really had a we had a screening test that caused us to kind of overdiagnosis

449
00:46:39,850 --> 00:46:45,490
and find these indolent cancers that would not otherwise have been found. That's a good example.

450
00:46:45,700 --> 00:46:50,259
How about some other disease, though, where there's been a really big change in how it was diagnosed over time or some

451
00:46:50,260 --> 00:46:53,950
condition where there's been a big change in how it was diagnosed over time,

452
00:46:53,950 --> 00:46:59,320
it really makes it seem like incidence has increased markedly and you would think of a good example doesn't have to be cancer.

453
00:47:05,560 --> 00:47:09,780
Yeah. This might be not the best example, but autism.

454
00:47:09,790 --> 00:47:17,110
That's a great example, in fact. So were you going to say I was thinking maybe like the use of antiretroviral therapy for HIV?

455
00:47:17,380 --> 00:47:22,960
Mm hmm. I'm thinking, like, uh, assuming you know that this is the deficiency syndrome.

456
00:47:22,990 --> 00:47:26,740
Yeah. And then that would lead to be more successful.

457
00:47:27,370 --> 00:47:30,550
Yeah, absolutely. I would think, though, that that's a real change.

458
00:47:30,560 --> 00:47:33,720
Right? So that's a real change in the incidence of chaos, right?

459
00:47:33,730 --> 00:47:40,510
Because we have had an influence on on people's T-cell counts, on AIDS developing,

460
00:47:40,780 --> 00:47:47,330
whereas the SD example, it used to be that only the most severe cases of autism were called autism.

461
00:47:47,350 --> 00:47:56,950
Right. So people who are nonverbal or displayed kind of the most severe symptoms of autism, whereas now we recognize it as a spectrum.

462
00:47:57,340 --> 00:47:59,770
And there are people with, you know,

463
00:47:59,770 --> 00:48:08,790
very mild symptoms or who whose symptoms would not have classified them as being on the autism spectrum or being autistic 30 years ago.

464
00:48:08,800 --> 00:48:15,220
Right. And now they are. So that is an example where we have expanded the definition of a disease, I would say.

465
00:48:15,580 --> 00:48:18,219
And that has caused it to appear as if there are more cases.

466
00:48:18,220 --> 00:48:27,430
Do we really think that these people who are now being diagnosed with ASD didn't exist or that those people I think that they were they were there,

467
00:48:27,430 --> 00:48:30,150
they just weren't counted. Right. And now they are.

468
00:48:30,160 --> 00:48:38,650
And so this, this epidemic we have of autism could just be we're recognizing more, you know, the fullness of the spectrum of that.

469
00:48:38,680 --> 00:48:41,770
Yes. Good other example is mental health related.

470
00:48:41,770 --> 00:48:44,950
And I think there is definitely some like true increase.

471
00:48:44,950 --> 00:48:52,059
And yes, but also I think there's probably some that's related to ah like social acceptance

472
00:48:52,060 --> 00:48:55,420
of going to therapy and seeking to fight for some types of things too.

473
00:48:55,540 --> 00:48:58,660
Absolutely, yes. Yeah, I think that's absolutely true.

474
00:48:59,650 --> 00:49:07,510
I also think of like identification of familial diseases and hereditary cancer, hereditary syndromes and group cancer.

475
00:49:07,840 --> 00:49:11,870
So finding them in like the really early stages. Yeah, I think all of that is true.

476
00:49:11,900 --> 00:49:17,360
Right. So those are examples of the way we diagnose and classify a disease has changed the disease

477
00:49:17,360 --> 00:49:22,059
for people who it may be some combination of there's no change or there's some change,

478
00:49:22,060 --> 00:49:25,380
but biggest change has really been in how we classify it.

479
00:49:25,390 --> 00:49:31,630
Right. So screening better diagnostic techniques, changes in classification.

480
00:49:32,380 --> 00:49:34,770
All right. So let's go ahead and work on question two.

481
00:49:34,780 --> 00:49:43,060
This is basically going back to that, those slides and you're going to look now at those same kind of graphs for incidence.

482
00:49:43,150 --> 00:49:58,000
So we're going to take 10 minutes. So we'll come back at four and talk about these answers as more swine flu incidence rates among males.

483
00:49:58,390 --> 00:50:02,110
Yeah, I know, but I started.

484
00:50:02,110 --> 00:50:16,300
Okay. Yeah, you did. See, I think you'll see this all over the country just because are returning these

485
00:50:16,310 --> 00:50:21,730
and yes but it's it's basically did you do it or not and if you didn't do it,

486
00:50:21,730 --> 00:50:24,950
that's okay. I know you're all working on it. That's fine, but.

487
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:28,270
Okay. Yeah, okay.

488
00:50:28,270 --> 00:50:33,090
And what was it? So it seemed like it was academic thinking.

489
00:50:33,130 --> 00:50:39,220
I read in the he actually said that it returns the level of like pre 1992 when they started

490
00:50:39,370 --> 00:50:47,150
expanding the screening and I think it did it's kind of looking at that spike in 1992.

491
00:50:47,200 --> 00:50:52,840
You go to 1989 and then you look at like 2011 and yeah, kind of looks like.

492
00:50:53,500 --> 00:50:56,559
But then it does still look like it's climbing a bit later.

493
00:50:56,560 --> 00:51:00,700
So like I said, it did go back down like that.

494
00:51:00,700 --> 00:51:05,120
And I think that's probably just because screening recommendations are continually dated.

495
00:51:05,630 --> 00:51:18,550
If you just you just kind of understand the question when it's asking to look at the experience and they don't want to know what's going okay.

496
00:51:18,550 --> 00:51:30,760
What occurred was early 1991 is probably because that we recommend that people get a good look at it.

497
00:51:31,000 --> 00:51:36,420
Yeah, I think it's probably techniques, trends.

498
00:51:37,690 --> 00:51:49,720
Yeah. You start to find some questionnaire screening procedures and our catching like really early stage answers like what was the last one.

499
00:51:50,350 --> 00:51:55,360
I think what it would be because of your.

500
00:51:55,480 --> 00:52:01,920
Yeah that might be because I know he has a prostate specific.

501
00:52:02,050 --> 00:52:04,990
Yeah. Yeah, yeah. No I don't think that's necessarily.

502
00:52:05,780 --> 00:52:22,870
Probably compared to a heart attack, which is just a 1979 year old man excited about somebody, at any rate.

503
00:52:23,070 --> 00:52:27,649
Yeah, yeah. But it's hard. It's really hard to clear your mind, right?

504
00:52:27,650 --> 00:52:32,540
Yeah. Yeah. So did the prostate cancer incidence rates go back down?

505
00:52:32,570 --> 00:52:37,070
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

506
00:52:37,070 --> 00:52:42,540
They didn't go back down. Why do we think an opening?

507
00:52:43,220 --> 00:52:51,770
I mean, testing for probably, probably going down because a lot of them are used more.

508
00:52:51,770 --> 00:52:54,970
Such as how reliable or.

509
00:52:55,280 --> 00:53:03,560
Yeah, that could be. I don't really know much. So another reason why the truth is, is one thing.

510
00:53:04,010 --> 00:53:07,190
I mean, I can imagine a luxury or people just don't want anything.

511
00:53:10,130 --> 00:53:13,360
That's called hypothesizing. Hypothesizing. Yeah.

512
00:53:13,580 --> 00:53:22,070
Sorry I should use a scientific there I think.

513
00:53:22,460 --> 00:53:31,090
Yeah I know. I don't mind as I the breast cancer I know but it's like so much iron and all the other ones and there was like a,

514
00:53:31,100 --> 00:53:35,239
like cause like a reaction increase.

515
00:53:35,240 --> 00:53:45,770
I want to say that it really attractive, but actually obviously very aggressive and oh my gosh.

516
00:53:46,160 --> 00:53:50,750
Yeah, that's what I like her. Yes, I know.

517
00:53:52,150 --> 00:53:59,720
Yeah, I know. But I remember there's too many maybe other reading by your peers.

518
00:54:00,710 --> 00:54:07,470
Yeah, same. I was seeing a little bit of it.

519
00:54:07,600 --> 00:54:15,340
Not that if you had a personal problem this time, I didn't do anything else other than to say,

520
00:54:15,380 --> 00:54:20,390
let's say that you're like, okay, I know this is significant for a lot of people.

521
00:54:21,080 --> 00:54:27,720
Too many other reasons. I feel that. Exactly. I didn't measure and they probably couldn't really.

522
00:54:27,800 --> 00:54:34,340
No, not really. Like many different cancers, especially from.

523
00:54:34,490 --> 00:54:38,540
It's interesting that there aren't a lot. Yeah, they're getting tested a lot.

524
00:54:39,110 --> 00:54:43,670
I'm not really sure exactly the feasibility.

525
00:54:43,830 --> 00:54:48,710
Yeah, it just. I think it just seems pretty straightforward.

526
00:54:49,280 --> 00:54:57,290
Yeah. I'd like to know what other changes do we notice over time, how much time to other changes and generate hypotheses like, you know,

527
00:54:57,290 --> 00:55:07,110
they don't I think I mean, I think another reason might be because it's like of people tested and I don't know, I mean, I don't know what it is,

528
00:55:07,160 --> 00:55:20,959
but I remember my mom is somebody mammograms and younger and I was like I have never in my life it seems like most people they probably had the best

529
00:55:20,960 --> 00:55:32,510
answer about maybe just other environmental conditions that are necessary and what used to be like 40 and now it's like me for cancer decided that.

530
00:55:32,870 --> 00:55:38,290
Okay, so that's why I remember her so funny I don't really have inspiring.

531
00:55:38,660 --> 00:55:44,810
Yeah I remember my mom complaining about it and be like, oh yeah, we'll just wait until you have to do it.

532
00:55:45,200 --> 00:55:48,829
And I have three mammograms every day.

533
00:55:48,830 --> 00:55:52,490
Well, it's not as bad as you know.

534
00:55:53,330 --> 00:55:56,770
It's also. No, none of them are as bad as that. So. Yeah, yeah.

535
00:55:56,780 --> 00:55:59,900
Very, very, very, very cold coming down again.

536
00:56:00,140 --> 00:56:13,790
So I mean, because it is like also because like you said, there was like it was like, yeah, for us.

537
00:56:13,990 --> 00:56:17,120
Yeah, yeah, yeah. I've seen something like that too.

538
00:56:17,120 --> 00:56:39,169
I've never actually done oh she had three and I like really cancer treatment improvements because I guess considerably better control information,

539
00:56:39,170 --> 00:56:45,540
beautiful treatment being on screen to speak to cancer.

540
00:56:45,610 --> 00:56:58,610
But I don't know, that's another possible cause you did.

541
00:56:58,610 --> 00:57:04,730
Of course you have to now with the emails and.

542
00:57:08,150 --> 00:57:15,210
I don't think you're there. Yeah, I just want you to have that liver and breast cancer.

543
00:57:16,560 --> 00:57:35,340
I know. It's also kind of obvious. I think it's the or not significantly that there are other reasons who I am and I am changing lives for the truth.

544
00:57:36,660 --> 00:57:45,570
I mean, London Broncos is just like the league compared to I feel like at the point where it's kind of, you know.

545
00:57:46,200 --> 00:57:48,780
Yeah. It could be, you know, like for, you know,

546
00:57:50,430 --> 00:58:13,730
we were working on these kind of amazing experiences and you guys have been doing a type of more someone like it's an absolute anthem or anything.

547
00:58:13,780 --> 00:58:19,430
I know from here in Michigan, I they're going to deal with you guys.

548
00:58:19,440 --> 00:58:28,230
None of us are soon. I mean, I can probably tell that I can't afford to lose my country.

549
00:58:28,820 --> 00:58:32,150
But again, putting it together.

550
00:58:32,260 --> 00:58:36,450
Yeah, that and the holiday party go really awkward, you know.

551
00:58:37,170 --> 00:58:42,690
I mean, yeah, I know that going to get there, you know?

552
00:58:43,260 --> 00:58:47,190
Right. I feel like most people are wrapping up. So let's go ahead and talk about these answers.

553
00:58:47,430 --> 00:58:51,990
So I asked you to look at these trends in incidence rates among men.

554
00:58:52,410 --> 00:58:55,770
So again, this is the incidence rate per 100,000 population.

555
00:58:55,770 --> 00:59:03,509
It is age adjusted because we basically don't show crew rates for cancer and we're going up through 2019.

556
00:59:03,510 --> 00:59:09,870
But we only started in 1975. Right. So remember the death rates started at 1930 and the incidence rates started 1975.

557
00:59:10,230 --> 00:59:16,470
And that's because we really didn't start doing cancer registration in this country until 1975 or so.

558
00:59:16,600 --> 00:59:20,909
Okay. So what did I ask you to do here?

559
00:59:20,910 --> 00:59:30,930
So I asked you to talk about what happened in the early 1990s with prostate cancer and did it go back to pre 1992 levels?

560
00:59:31,770 --> 00:59:35,550
So that's pretty impressive, right? Like what's going on? What do you guys know what happened there?

561
00:59:37,860 --> 00:59:41,670
That was when they introduced this PSA screening at the screening.

562
00:59:41,700 --> 00:59:45,570
Exactly right. And so then did it come back down to pre PSA levels?

563
00:59:46,810 --> 00:59:50,400
Eventually in like 2015 eventually, but not right after.

564
00:59:50,410 --> 00:59:55,420
So let's kind of look at this part of the graph. Like, did it immediately come right back down now?

565
00:59:55,690 --> 01:00:00,610
So this is your clue that we're over diagnosing. Right. Because if you would.

566
01:00:00,820 --> 01:00:05,560
So say you introduce a new screening test. We used to catch all prostate cancers at stage three and four.

567
01:00:06,190 --> 01:00:09,400
We didn't have a screening test, but now suddenly we're catching them on stage one or two.

568
01:00:09,670 --> 01:00:15,640
You would expect a big bump, right? Because you're going to catch all kind of the prevalent cancers and those new cancers that you would expect.

569
01:00:15,910 --> 01:00:20,350
It's like you're catching up. Do you see what I'm saying? You're catching up to catch all of those cases.

570
01:00:20,350 --> 01:00:24,160
So you would have a big bump, but it should come right back down to where it was.

571
01:00:24,730 --> 01:00:32,469
Except now we're over diagnosing. Now we have a higher kind of baseline level than we did in some of these other dips down.

572
01:00:32,470 --> 01:00:35,799
And we're due to changes in screening recommendations and things like that.

573
01:00:35,800 --> 01:00:42,790
Right. But essentially, that's kind of what happened. So you would expect it to go up, come right back down to where it was, but.

574
01:00:43,820 --> 01:00:50,210
That's not what happened. Right. So this is our clue that we're now over diagnosing prostate cancer probably.

575
01:00:51,050 --> 01:00:56,640
Yes. Dumb question. But I guess, how do you overdiagnosis like.

576
01:00:57,110 --> 01:01:02,090
I guess my thought is there it's not. Is this based off of the test or is it based on home?

577
01:01:02,360 --> 01:01:08,329
So we actually know that if you go back to the autopsy studies of men from before PSA was available who

578
01:01:08,330 --> 01:01:14,030
died of we never diagnose prostate cancer in regard to something else or get hit by a box or whatever.

579
01:01:14,750 --> 01:01:21,800
If you look at the poll decision of men in their eighties. Like 70 to 80% of them have cancer in their prostate at autopsy.

580
01:01:22,220 --> 01:01:27,770
But it was never diagnosed and it clearly was never put on them because they die something else before it ever crossed them.

581
01:01:27,770 --> 01:01:28,820
Any symptoms of prostate.

582
01:01:29,540 --> 01:01:37,610
So we know that some proportion of cancers of the prostate are indolent and would never progress to be clinically relevant in a man's lifetime.

583
01:01:38,540 --> 01:01:43,280
We are now finding those where we can find them with cancer screening and biopsy.

584
01:01:44,060 --> 01:01:50,960
So the trick is figuring out which cancers will become clinically relevant to need treatment versus which ones don't.

585
01:01:51,500 --> 01:01:56,120
And I think I said last time, like, if the treatment were no big deal, you just do it right and do treatment, fine.

586
01:01:56,690 --> 01:02:00,850
Or treating some of the damage that that's what I mean. But the treatment is not that right.

587
01:02:00,860 --> 01:02:03,979
The treatment first line treatment for every prostate cancer is happening,

588
01:02:03,980 --> 01:02:10,880
which will cause urinary incontinence and sexual dysfunction and a large proportion of men receive the treatment.

589
01:02:11,930 --> 01:02:14,990
So it's a it's a kind of a sticky wicket.

590
01:02:15,020 --> 01:02:19,549
We have a screening test, but it catches things that don't need to be treated and things that do.

591
01:02:19,550 --> 01:02:23,600
And then the trick is which ones are we going to treat? We've gotten a lot better at that.

592
01:02:23,600 --> 01:02:31,370
And a lot of prostate cancer research is aimed at refining our crystal ball, essentially to figure out which ones we need.

593
01:02:31,880 --> 01:02:35,330
The the the brass ring. Like the the.

594
01:02:36,510 --> 01:02:39,419
Something that would really transform prostate cancer research is if we had a

595
01:02:39,420 --> 01:02:43,130
better screening test that actually found clinically relevant prostate cancer,

596
01:02:43,160 --> 01:02:49,740
not just all of it. So that's a little preview for my prostate cancer lecture.

597
01:02:49,950 --> 01:02:51,540
Why it's increasing?

598
01:02:51,540 --> 01:03:00,420
Probably because now we went back and said, Oh, actually, because if you go back to mortality, the mortality started a lot back up again a little bit.

599
01:03:00,430 --> 01:03:04,079
And so we actually they were like, Everybody should get PSA.

600
01:03:04,080 --> 01:03:08,489
Oh, no. Oops. Actually, it turns out that's bad because now we're over diagnosing people.

601
01:03:08,490 --> 01:03:14,160
So we recommend against PSA. Oh, now prostate cancer mortality is increasing,

602
01:03:14,160 --> 01:03:20,820
so we kind of recommend PSA you should talk to your doctor about it is basically where we've gone with prostate cancer screening.

603
01:03:21,150 --> 01:03:25,160
So I think these this is like, yeah, everybody should get it.

604
01:03:25,170 --> 01:03:29,850
Oh, shoot. No, we shouldn't. Actually, we should. Is basically what this is.

605
01:03:30,030 --> 01:03:33,870
What is what is happening at the population level. We should, but only sort of.

606
01:03:36,150 --> 01:03:41,670
If that makes any sense. That's the. Kind of silly way of explaining it, but that's essentially what has happened.

607
01:03:42,240 --> 01:03:45,300
You can kind of track the changes in recommendations with this graph.

608
01:03:47,690 --> 01:03:52,700
I think another thing that's important to note here is that colon rectum incidence has also been going down.

609
01:03:53,000 --> 01:03:56,530
So and I would attribute that to the screening test.

610
01:03:56,540 --> 01:04:04,130
So when you think about screening tests, there are some that catch early cancer and there are some that kept pre-cancerous lesions.

611
01:04:04,790 --> 01:04:09,440
So I can think of two that catch pre-cancerous lesions and one of them is colonoscopy.

612
01:04:10,370 --> 01:04:16,250
The at the ultimate goal of colonoscopy would be to catch polyps and remove them before they ever become cancer.

613
01:04:16,280 --> 01:04:18,290
Right. Same thing with pap smears.

614
01:04:18,290 --> 01:04:24,650
If you do pap smear and you find abnormal cervical cells that are precancerous, you would you would cut that lesion out.

615
01:04:24,980 --> 01:04:33,830
Right. And then it becomes cancer. So colorectal and cervical cancer screening should reduce both mortality and incidence.

616
01:04:35,430 --> 01:04:41,069
But breast and prostate cancer screening are actually catching early cancer so they

617
01:04:41,070 --> 01:04:45,180
can actually make incidence seem to pop up because you're finding more cancer.

618
01:04:45,630 --> 01:04:49,050
But mortality should go down because you caught it early and can treat it more effectively.

619
01:04:49,800 --> 01:04:57,150
Does that make sense? It's a little weird. And we'll talk more about this kind of continuum of pre-cancer to cancer in our biology lecture.

620
01:04:59,610 --> 01:05:05,950
And then for women. Anything different you noticed here you thought was interesting.

621
01:05:07,950 --> 01:05:12,330
A lot of kind of the same stuff over here again breast you see kind of pop up.

622
01:05:14,060 --> 01:05:22,560
That would partly be due to mammograms. Right. Right.

623
01:05:23,670 --> 01:05:28,080
All right. So now from PowerPoint presentation going back.

624
01:05:29,470 --> 01:05:33,970
258. Where was I? Up here.

625
01:05:36,520 --> 01:05:42,249
Yeah. Okay. So we said that one of the things that causes changes in incidents are changes in the major causes of cancer.

626
01:05:42,250 --> 01:05:52,930
Right. So smoking is a big one. This shows you the proportion of each of these data slightly old, but it is still more or less true.

627
01:05:53,860 --> 01:05:58,060
It's showing you the proportion of each of these cancer sites that is thought to be attributable to cigaret smoking.

628
01:05:58,480 --> 01:06:05,380
Big, big chunk of lung, obviously. Right. But, you know, chunks of other bladder is another one where smoking is a major risk factor.

629
01:06:05,440 --> 01:06:12,580
Oropharynx and larynx, huge risk factor. So you can see kind of the proportion of each of these cancers that is thought to be due to smoking.

630
01:06:14,890 --> 01:06:19,330
We also have had but of course, smoking has been decreasing over time, which is a good thing.

631
01:06:19,930 --> 01:06:25,570
On the other hand, obesity is another big risk factor for cancer, and that has been increasing over time.

632
01:06:26,860 --> 01:06:31,329
Kind of substantially. I will also point out in my obesity lecture, however,

633
01:06:31,330 --> 01:06:35,860
that this is despite everybody yelling about obesity epidemic and how we should all be losing weight.

634
01:06:36,460 --> 01:06:42,500
I would I would venture to say that there's not a person in this country who is overweight, who is not aware that everyone thinks they should be thin.

635
01:06:42,520 --> 01:06:47,979
Right. So, again, keep in mind, my point of view on this is,

636
01:06:47,980 --> 01:06:54,280
is until we have an evidence based recommendation that allows people to lose and keep off weight,

637
01:06:54,280 --> 01:07:00,190
is it really ethical to shame people at the doctor every time they go in and tell them that they should be losing weight?

638
01:07:01,190 --> 01:07:08,170
Well, yes. So are you saying that like diet and exercise is not an evidence like that way to lose weight?

639
01:07:08,410 --> 01:07:12,370
I will show you some evidence that suggests I mean, people can lose weight, but they can't keep it off.

640
01:07:12,760 --> 01:07:17,790
And especially people who are. Very overweight and have been for most of their life.

641
01:07:18,300 --> 01:07:22,410
The proportion of those people who are able to lose weight and keep it off long term.

642
01:07:22,770 --> 01:07:30,720
Going from being in an obese category to being in a normal body weight category, normal BMI category is vanishingly small.

643
01:07:31,230 --> 01:07:36,470
Right. That they can do it. People can do it for a time, but then they usually gain it back.

644
01:07:36,480 --> 01:07:37,440
So long term,

645
01:07:37,440 --> 01:07:44,550
sustained weight loss is kind of the holy grail of obesity research that nobody has really figured out how to tell people to effectively do.

646
01:07:45,790 --> 01:07:51,279
Otherwise you would see I mean, the most people I think, who are overweight or obese would like to be thin.

647
01:07:51,280 --> 01:07:56,739
Right. I think that, you know, especially with all the societal pressure, I don't think there's a lot of people who are just like that.

648
01:07:56,740 --> 01:08:01,930
Forget it. I don't care. Right. I mean, I think most people would, if there were a way to do it, would do it.

649
01:08:02,860 --> 01:08:06,850
And it's just increased. Right. Despite all of that pressure.

650
01:08:07,180 --> 01:08:12,969
And I think that's some of the best evidence that we don't have a great way to tell people to do this and tell it.

651
01:08:12,970 --> 01:08:20,980
I mean, I don't think that there is a person who is in the category of BMI, 35 plus, who is not aware that if you eat less food.

652
01:08:22,050 --> 01:08:26,730
In theory, you should be center right or if you exercise more right, it just does not seem to.

653
01:08:27,190 --> 01:08:30,720
It's more complicated than that. Right. And that's kind of something that we don't address.

654
01:08:30,960 --> 01:08:36,150
We kind of act like it's all up to the individual and that if they're not doing it, they're doing something wrong.

655
01:08:36,360 --> 01:08:38,640
And I don't think that's true. Right. Yeah.

656
01:08:38,790 --> 01:08:48,360
I'm just thinking right now I have a feeling of personal feeling that medical, especially once they're like over blaming everything they see.

657
01:08:48,930 --> 01:08:52,259
I think there is. Yeah. And we're going to talk about that in the obesity lecture.

658
01:08:52,260 --> 01:08:56,160
We're going to get into that. We're going to get into kind of what correlates with.

659
01:08:57,190 --> 01:09:02,440
Having more fat on your body that could also be related to increased risk of disease.

660
01:09:02,540 --> 01:09:07,719
Right. Because I think if you really think it's just having more fat on your body that increases your risk of disease,

661
01:09:07,720 --> 01:09:12,580
then losing weight should be the answer. We can't tell people how to do that effectively yet.

662
01:09:12,880 --> 01:09:16,630
Right. So are there other things we could do? I think there are.

663
01:09:16,660 --> 01:09:20,830
And we'll talk about that. Okay.

664
01:09:23,660 --> 01:09:29,690
We've talked about this. I'm not going to go into this. I think this is an interesting little graphic.

665
01:09:30,170 --> 01:09:31,969
This is the leading causes of death that we see.

666
01:09:31,970 --> 01:09:37,340
This is old, but, you know, it's basically the same ranking rate, heart disease, cancer, stroke, blah, blah, blah.

667
01:09:37,550 --> 01:09:46,060
But these are the actual causes of death. You know, tobacco per day and physical inactivity, alcohol consumption, microbial agents.

668
01:09:46,060 --> 01:09:51,969
Right. So these are the things that underlie these diseases. And I think that was sort of an that's a very public, healthy way of thinking about it.

669
01:09:51,970 --> 01:09:55,940
Right. So I kind of like that picture. All right.

670
01:09:55,940 --> 01:09:59,960
Now we're going to talk about differences by ethnicity. So we've got 10 minutes left in class.

671
01:10:00,350 --> 01:10:07,040
So let's have you guys go ahead and do the group work and then we will talk about it next time and you can turn it in next time.

672
01:10:07,310 --> 01:10:12,080
Okay, so hang on to it. We will go over the answers at the beginning of class next time.

673
01:10:12,410 --> 01:10:15,650
Don't worry, I've got a slop day built in for catching up. It's fine.

674
01:10:15,980 --> 01:10:20,000
This always. This always happens. We always take a little longer and get excited about talking about things.

675
01:10:20,000 --> 01:10:22,040
So we being me. So it's fine.

676
01:10:23,100 --> 01:10:28,610
Okay, so go ahead and use the last 10 minutes of class to work on the question three, and we'll start next time by going over the answers.

677
01:10:29,550 --> 01:10:33,110
Oh, I just finished with the graphs.

678
01:10:33,130 --> 01:10:38,690
The room in there. Yeah. I think, I don't know if it's.

679
01:10:40,310 --> 01:10:44,600
Yeah but it's super, it's like super easy to use, this is what it looks like.

680
01:10:44,600 --> 01:10:54,440
And then you know how to play around with it and you find I actually think it's great.

681
01:10:54,440 --> 01:11:03,880
I love it the same. So you get a lot more to do with it because you have like clubs around it.

682
01:11:04,220 --> 01:11:07,460
Oh, we had similar in 1979.

683
01:11:07,910 --> 01:11:10,010
Yeah, it is a pretty good it is a pretty fun website.

684
01:11:10,670 --> 01:11:30,210
I like play around with don't know what is the blue and white and the blue is okay I think you said it was inspired for the first time.

685
01:11:31,250 --> 01:11:36,770
I thought it was a great way. And then and it includes Hispanic as well.

686
01:11:37,160 --> 01:11:42,200
So like white and Hispanic and then black and Hispanic is blue.

687
01:11:44,260 --> 01:11:56,889
And I was like it like because I think I actually I just checked the blog and they,

688
01:11:56,890 --> 01:12:01,730
you know, anyone who identifies like so it's like anyone who identifies.

689
01:12:05,900 --> 01:12:11,690
So I think they just added are like white and black and then they are right.

690
01:12:13,070 --> 01:12:16,070
Okay. So you're saying it's is included.

691
01:12:16,070 --> 01:12:23,960
It will be categorized as white, Hispanic or like white, non-Hispanic, white, non-Hispanic or both.

692
01:12:23,970 --> 01:12:32,900
Times I go back to the very beginning and I thought, oh, I couldn't figure out here is the next four years.

693
01:12:33,170 --> 01:12:36,680
So I could get a lot.

694
01:12:37,190 --> 01:12:46,280
Of course, you know, it's a very good start, but there are a lot of them.

695
01:12:46,670 --> 01:12:51,800
Okay. So then this is saying the mortality rate is an interactive map.

696
01:12:53,750 --> 01:13:03,950
I'd like to bring you this because this was an old friend.

697
01:13:09,620 --> 01:13:15,070
I don't think it was really about cancer.

698
01:13:15,080 --> 01:13:33,830
So I mean, I think we are not the ones that the this into black and white that my brother and I know there were only three days we just

699
01:13:33,830 --> 01:13:50,360
think that maybe when President Obama wins the presidency this generation and so like like like like I'm making a joke.

700
01:13:51,060 --> 01:13:56,010
Yeah yeah. I think I'm starting to think that, which is why I don't have like a long term.

701
01:13:56,020 --> 01:14:00,000
I mean, that's a total gross.

702
01:14:00,020 --> 01:14:04,999
I think that's why they're doing it.

703
01:14:05,000 --> 01:14:14,329
And I think you might be triggered sublimating that and saying this is okay, so do we have all students separate?

704
01:14:14,330 --> 01:14:33,290
So I don't know the change in racial groups and other people feeling kind of like you're probably going to go for the final.

705
01:14:34,070 --> 01:14:41,450
Oh, no, I don't really care.

706
01:14:41,840 --> 01:14:47,240
And I don't think that makes sense. That's very nice.

707
01:14:47,270 --> 01:14:54,200
But you know, because I would expect this, which is very different because.

708
01:14:55,910 --> 01:15:10,290
We're not musical number one. Yeah, no architects and engineers because they have no idea.

709
01:15:11,200 --> 01:15:15,020
They don't see finish program at the same time.

710
01:15:17,240 --> 01:15:24,720
And also, I was wondering if it was too good to be true.

711
01:15:28,860 --> 01:15:34,460
I think I think it's a question of now, you know, I'm sorry to rate some disparity.

712
01:15:35,790 --> 01:15:43,460
It's not the kind of thing that apparently affects incidence rates.

713
01:15:44,420 --> 01:16:04,790
Any of your tests that are, you know, diagnosed as one of the things that I felt like an outsider.

714
01:16:04,790 --> 01:16:20,330
You wanted to go. I felt like I had to write, which a bunch of other things.

715
01:16:20,870 --> 01:16:36,740
I think that. Yeah. Even when I went to the worst experience some are already using, like I could take them just like, oh my God, we're all vibrating.

716
01:16:37,250 --> 01:16:41,000
I think I was experiencing.

717
01:16:41,360 --> 01:16:49,030
So, yeah. And I don't know if I was listening to that.

718
01:16:49,040 --> 01:16:54,330
I mean, you know, I don't know.

719
01:16:58,520 --> 01:17:11,300
Yeah, I, I just think I'd really like to think about the use of everything to be higher, but.

720
01:17:11,720 --> 01:17:15,110
Yeah, no, I don't. I don't have a disadvantage.

721
01:17:23,780 --> 01:17:37,220
Yeah, it is. But I do a lot and I look like they are making a lot of my work like that before and they don't want to,

722
01:17:37,230 --> 01:17:40,660
but I want to do something like in the summer.

723
01:17:40,660 --> 01:17:46,740
And I was like I actually like I did, I don't really know,

724
01:17:46,760 --> 01:17:58,990
I really like it because I like you're not very open minded, I think, because it makes me think of something.

725
01:17:59,120 --> 01:18:01,650
I just think that it's.

726
01:18:07,300 --> 01:18:17,720
When you live in New Zealand, other countries don't have items like those yourself heading there with these guys for a hamburger.

727
01:18:18,550 --> 01:18:23,440
Different question. Yeah, so definitely go down there in the summer.

728
01:18:23,440 --> 01:18:26,679
I was very stubborn for years about like what's going to happen.

729
01:18:26,680 --> 01:18:30,610
It changed my mindset very quickly.

730
01:18:30,900 --> 01:18:37,570
I don't know. I thought that that would be a good thing. Now I know I'm a shooter all my life.

731
01:18:38,540 --> 01:18:51,310
Yeah. I mean, like, really, really lot of it was like, you're right, it is California.

732
01:18:51,670 --> 01:18:55,570
But they're like, no, like like can the Midwest transition?

733
01:18:55,750 --> 01:18:59,140
You know, there's like incidents of mortality.

734
01:18:59,980 --> 01:19:06,430
Oh, no. Let's see what this. Yeah, yeah.

735
01:19:07,120 --> 01:19:10,240
That's not. Tell your mother again.

736
01:19:11,680 --> 01:19:22,480
I like Greeley. Also this literally over on here in the winter, my uncle actually lived in Gateway and actually really close to his grandmother.

737
01:19:22,810 --> 01:19:27,970
Beautiful, loved. One of the most beautiful states I've ever been to. I like that once in my head.

738
01:19:28,360 --> 01:19:35,470
Well, besides my own life and bison and all this, there's literally nothing.

739
01:19:36,250 --> 01:19:39,750
Nothing. All right, guys, it's 420.

740
01:19:39,790 --> 01:19:44,580
Well, there's actually even there is a really if you want to keep working, you're welcome to.

741
01:19:44,590 --> 01:19:48,930
But class is done all day long for health reasons.

742
01:19:50,550 --> 01:19:56,290
You don't have to go home and can't stay here. Is that what you said? I have really committed to doing an impact.
