1
00:00:01,740 --> 00:00:02,501
Hey everyone.

2
00:00:02,501 --> 00:00:05,564
This is the last quick review video for

3
00:00:05,564 --> 00:00:09,600
the non protein nitrogen containing compounds.

4
00:00:09,600 --> 00:00:12,693
So yes we do have some nitrogen and

5
00:00:12,693 --> 00:00:18,040
other compounds that are not necessarily protein.

6
00:00:18,040 --> 00:00:20,101
And this is what we'll be talking about.

7
00:00:20,101 --> 00:00:24,340
So this is the nitrogen, the amino group over here.

8
00:00:24,340 --> 00:00:27,700
We then talk about uptake, how they're absorbed into the body.

9
00:00:27,700 --> 00:00:34,031
And then how we use some of the amino acids for nitrogen containing compounds.

10
00:00:34,031 --> 00:00:38,909
We can use them for neurotransmitters, for purine and pyrimidine bases which are for

11
00:00:38,909 --> 00:00:41,140
the DNA.

12
00:00:41,140 --> 00:00:44,101
And the other compounds we'll be talking about today,

13
00:00:44,101 --> 00:00:49,140
those ones they are synthesized in the liver.

14
00:00:49,140 --> 00:00:51,570
So let's start with glutathione.

15
00:00:51,570 --> 00:00:55,971
It's by synthesized in the liver and it's found in most cell types.

16
00:00:55,971 --> 00:01:00,981
We then talk about glutathione and the pentose phosphate pathway and

17
00:01:00,981 --> 00:01:07,220
how it's necessary for removing oxidative stress and reactive oxidative species.

18
00:01:07,220 --> 00:01:13,200
So it's reduced from GSH and then the oxidized form would be GSSG.

19
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:17,570
And this is that glutathione on over here.

20
00:01:17,570 --> 00:01:20,460
So it's considered an antioxidant which is what I just said.

21
00:01:20,460 --> 00:01:25,525
And how it works is that donates H from the SH group that

22
00:01:25,525 --> 00:01:30,141
it has to an oxidized species to reduce it, and so

23
00:01:30,141 --> 00:01:35,940
that it would no longer be oxidized in the oxidized form.

24
00:01:35,940 --> 00:01:40,776
And then whenever you have inflammation and disease state then GSH

25
00:01:40,776 --> 00:01:46,128
levels would naturally be declining because you would be using them up and

26
00:01:46,128 --> 00:01:49,520
now they would be in the oxidized form as GSSG.

27
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:52,841
And now they need to go back to their reduced form.

28
00:01:52,841 --> 00:02:00,840
So you need the pentose phosphate pathway to reduce them back into the GSH form.

29
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:04,151
It's also a substrate for other molecules over here.

30
00:02:04,151 --> 00:02:09,196
For example, you need glutathione to metabolize

31
00:02:09,196 --> 00:02:14,840
are arachidonic acid into acid and so on.

32
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:18,471
So thus glutathione main function as antioxidants.

33
00:02:18,471 --> 00:02:20,170
So that's the take home message.

34
00:02:20,170 --> 00:02:23,540
Carnitine is synthesized and liver from lysine.

35
00:02:23,540 --> 00:02:26,820
It relies on a methyl group by SAM.

36
00:02:26,820 --> 00:02:31,410
So SAM is the universal method owner in the body and

37
00:02:31,410 --> 00:02:36,658
carnitine and would rely on the methyl group donated from

38
00:02:36,658 --> 00:02:45,440
SAM through the cycle, the one-carbon metabolism cycle.

39
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:47,790
Okay, this is the cycle again.

40
00:02:47,790 --> 00:02:51,131
So carnitine is synthesized from lysine,

41
00:02:51,131 --> 00:02:59,040
this is as we mentioned it relies on SAM to donate methyl group.

42
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:02,169
And then remember carnitine from the lipid unit,

43
00:03:02,169 --> 00:03:06,043
we talked about carnitine as being important for the CPT 1 and

44
00:03:06,043 --> 00:03:10,662
CPT 2 systems which are on the mitochondrial membranes and they allow for

45
00:03:10,662 --> 00:03:15,240
long chain fatty acids passage to the mitochondria from the cytoplast.

46
00:03:15,240 --> 00:03:20,154
So carnitine deficiency would impair oxidation of

47
00:03:20,154 --> 00:03:25,940
long chain fatty acids for sure.

48
00:03:25,940 --> 00:03:29,510
So some sources need fish, maybe supplements as well.

49
00:03:29,510 --> 00:03:36,350
And it's very highly by available.

50
00:03:36,350 --> 00:03:38,170
Choline.

51
00:03:38,170 --> 00:03:40,831
Its main role is for lipid transport.

52
00:03:40,831 --> 00:03:44,175
So think of phosphatidylcholine which is required for

53
00:03:44,175 --> 00:03:47,610
the LDL packaging from the liver into the bloodstream.

54
00:03:47,610 --> 00:03:50,800
So it's really important to make the membranes that

55
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:54,431
engulf the products of the liver to be sent out of the liver.

56
00:03:54,431 --> 00:03:58,853
So choline deficiency can lead to fatty liver disease because you cannot,

57
00:03:58,853 --> 00:04:03,276
your body would be incapable of making those nice membranes that contained

58
00:04:03,276 --> 00:04:07,279
phosphatidylcholine that is both hydrophobic and hydrophilic and

59
00:04:07,279 --> 00:04:11,840
this is how you would get fatty liver disease because all the fat that delivers

60
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:16,754
synthesizing is stuck in the liver because they cannot get transported outside due

61
00:04:16,754 --> 00:04:18,839
to choline deficiency.

62
00:04:18,839 --> 00:04:23,127
It's also necessary for acetylcholine which is a neurotransmitter and

63
00:04:23,127 --> 00:04:24,751
it's also a methyl donor.

64
00:04:24,751 --> 00:04:26,940
And we'll talk more about that.

65
00:04:26,940 --> 00:04:31,183
Dietary sources, mainly eggs, liver,

66
00:04:31,183 --> 00:04:35,192
wheat germ as are very high in choline.

67
00:04:35,192 --> 00:04:39,560
So acetylcholine, this is its function as a neurotransmitter over here.

68
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:45,010
It's important for memory, muscle control and motor skill development.

69
00:04:45,010 --> 00:04:49,392
And so cognitive performance would, according to this study,

70
00:04:49,392 --> 00:04:54,351
can be higher with higher choline levels and as a methyl donor over here.

71
00:04:54,351 --> 00:05:00,527
So we do talk about SAM as being the universal predominant methyl donor but

72
00:05:00,527 --> 00:05:06,304
also choline can partake, not by itself but it can become betaine and

73
00:05:06,304 --> 00:05:11,582
then betaine can go into the cycle and help donate a methyl group

74
00:05:11,582 --> 00:05:16,890
to homocysteine so that homocysteine can become a methylene.

75
00:05:16,890 --> 00:05:20,525
You can only imagine that choline deficiency would lead to a build up of

76
00:05:20,525 --> 00:05:24,591
homocysteine cuz your body would now be incapable of donating a methyl group to

77
00:05:24,591 --> 00:05:26,650
homocysteine to generate methylene.

78
00:05:26,650 --> 00:05:31,181
So choline deficiency would lead to increased homocysteine

79
00:05:31,181 --> 00:05:35,977
levels because your body is now incapable of further processing

80
00:05:35,977 --> 00:05:40,521
homocysteine into methylene which is this and this is that.

81
00:05:40,521 --> 00:05:43,171
So homocysteine build up, leads to stroke and heart disease.

82
00:05:43,171 --> 00:05:47,240
So it's very bad to the body.

83
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:49,060
So creatine over here,

84
00:05:49,060 --> 00:05:54,170
creatine is stored in the skeletal muscle, we barely excrete it.

85
00:05:54,170 --> 00:05:59,940
[COUGH] Dietary sources are meat and fish products and there is no DRI set for them.

86
00:05:59,940 --> 00:06:05,841
They are really important for very rapid movement, like sprinting for example.

87
00:06:05,841 --> 00:06:10,541
So you use creatine, so as soon as your muscles contract, if you are,

88
00:06:10,541 --> 00:06:14,285
let's say someone scared you and you jumped off so far or

89
00:06:14,285 --> 00:06:18,460
something, then you can use your creatine levels over here.

90
00:06:18,460 --> 00:06:23,360
So you use the ATP and it gets transformed into ADP.

91
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:29,639
So you've used an energy over here and then the creatin becomes phosphocreatine.

92
00:06:29,639 --> 00:06:34,086
So any rapid movement, any quick muscle contraction,

93
00:06:34,086 --> 00:06:38,360
you will be using your creatine stores in the muscle.

94
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:41,821
And this lasts for about I believe maybe 30 seconds.

95
00:06:41,821 --> 00:06:46,759
So it can last you for a very minimal period of time before you start using

96
00:06:46,759 --> 00:06:51,123
your other resources like the glycogen stores and the muscle or

97
00:06:51,123 --> 00:06:56,440
resorting to other stores in the body.

98
00:06:56,440 --> 00:06:58,521
So it's a coupled reactions.

99
00:06:58,521 --> 00:07:01,339
So you produce ATP that falls for creatine and

100
00:07:01,339 --> 00:07:06,236
then if you give your body enough time to rest it will regenerate the creatine so

101
00:07:06,236 --> 00:07:09,866
you can use it again so that you do not run out of creatine and

102
00:07:09,866 --> 00:07:13,946
you always have sufficient amounts that can help you in times of,

103
00:07:13,946 --> 00:07:18,740
whenever you need a very quick reflex or if you're sprinting or something.

104
00:07:18,740 --> 00:07:23,790
So supplementation would be really beneficial for someone who's a sprinter.

105
00:07:23,790 --> 00:07:29,586
So because they always need a quick energy source for a very short period of time.

106
00:07:29,586 --> 00:07:34,640
So enhance short duration maximal exercise capacity.

107
00:07:34,640 --> 00:07:36,390
So TMAO.

108
00:07:36,390 --> 00:07:40,107
We'll talk more about them.

109
00:07:40,107 --> 00:07:46,441
And here, so a serotonin is the happy hormone.

110
00:07:46,441 --> 00:07:48,030
Look at the smiley over here.

111
00:07:48,030 --> 00:07:53,140
And so it's an important neurotransmitter in the brain that makes you happy.

112
00:07:53,140 --> 00:07:55,431
It's made from tryptophan.

113
00:07:55,431 --> 00:07:58,620
So you need tryptophan to make serotonin.

114
00:07:58,620 --> 00:08:05,240
It's excitatory and it enhances mood, appetite, blood pressure and so on.

115
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:12,653
And it's been a target for antidepressants which tried to elevate serotonin levels.

116
00:08:12,653 --> 00:08:16,540
So MAOI would be an antidepressant.

117
00:08:16,540 --> 00:08:21,778
And so those would be inhibitors, they would inhibit MAO,

118
00:08:21,778 --> 00:08:26,808
so MAO would naturally degrade serotonin in the brain and

119
00:08:26,808 --> 00:08:30,820
that would lead to less of the happy hormone.

120
00:08:30,820 --> 00:08:34,687
So if you give someone an inhibitor of that then you would inhibit the breakdown

121
00:08:34,687 --> 00:08:38,740
of serotonin which would mean that you would have more of the happy hormone.

122
00:08:38,740 --> 00:08:42,421
So the flip side is that the MAOs,

123
00:08:42,421 --> 00:08:46,771
they do not only breakdown serotonin.

124
00:08:46,771 --> 00:08:49,390
They also break down something else called tyramine.

125
00:08:49,390 --> 00:08:54,491
And so when you give an inhibitor you inhibit the full function of MAO,

126
00:08:54,491 --> 00:08:59,073
so you would inhibit MAO's ability to break down serotonin and

127
00:08:59,073 --> 00:09:03,440
their ability to break down tyrosine as well.

128
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:08,531
So this is what I just said, MAOs, the actual monoamine oxidase.

129
00:09:08,531 --> 00:09:11,985
So the enzyme breaks down serotonin and breaks down tyramine,

130
00:09:11,985 --> 00:09:16,570
at the same time and tyramine is found in cheese, fish, alcohol, meats and so on.

131
00:09:16,570 --> 00:09:21,053
So when you give someone yeah, an inhibitor, an MAO Inhibitor,

132
00:09:21,053 --> 00:09:24,721
then they lose the ability to break down serotonin and

133
00:09:24,721 --> 00:09:29,301
breakdown tyramine, which means they will have more serotonin.

134
00:09:29,301 --> 00:09:31,180
So that's good, more of the happy hormone.

135
00:09:31,180 --> 00:09:34,547
But it also means that they will have more tyramine,

136
00:09:34,547 --> 00:09:39,215
which is not good because the build up of tyramine is toxic in the brain and

137
00:09:39,215 --> 00:09:43,760
it causes, here we go, headaches, high blood pressure and stroke.

138
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:52,040
So someone who's on an MAOI antidepressant needs to be very careful about their diet.

139
00:09:52,040 --> 00:09:56,849
And make sure that they're not consumed foods very high in tyramine cuz now that

140
00:09:56,849 --> 00:10:00,830
they're on this medication, they cannot break down tyramine.

141
00:10:00,830 --> 00:10:04,970
And this is what happens and that's it.

142
00:10:04,970 --> 00:10:07,890
Good luck.
