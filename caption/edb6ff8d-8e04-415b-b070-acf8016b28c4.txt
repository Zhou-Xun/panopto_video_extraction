00:00:06,700 --> 00:00:08,410
Hello everybody,

2
00:00:08,410 --> 00:00:16,120
my name is Ariane Donnelly, and I work for the Washtenaw County Health Department, in Washtenaw County, Michigan. And at Washtenaw County,

3
00:00:16,120 --> 00:00:25,060
for those of you who aren't familiar with that county, we actually have the University of Michigan is one of our big university systems there,

4
00:00:25,060 --> 00:00:28,780
as well as Eastern Michigan University, and Washtenaw County Community College.

5
00:00:28,780 --> 00:00:33,970
So in case you're familiar with those areas, that's where we are, we're in southeast Michigan.

6
00:00:33,970 --> 00:00:43,930
And today, and for my next presentation, I also really want to talk about addressing food insecurity, a governmental approach.

7
00:00:43,930 --> 00:00:49,840
Because even though I work, it took me a little while to realize that I work for,

8
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:58,300
even though I work for the health department, I am a government employee. So I always like to make sure to connect that, and bridge the gap.

9
00:00:58,300 --> 00:01:03,310
And just as a fun side note, you may already be fully aware of this,

10
00:01:03,310 --> 00:01:08,110
but we kind of joke that in government, we like our acronyms, we like our long names.

11
00:01:08,110 --> 00:01:14,380
So we'll kind of see acronyms peppered throughout here, and I know that FPHLP

12
00:01:14,380 --> 00:01:17,140
is a great acronym as well.

13
00:01:17,140 --> 00:01:25,150
But also, I just want to share what an exciting time it is for you to be a future public health leader and to be in this program.

14
00:01:25,150 --> 00:01:34,030
I'm sure it definitely has its challenges right now, but what an incredible opportunity to do, because this is public health,

15
00:01:34,030 --> 00:01:38,560
public health is always in action, but we really see it forefront in the pandemic.

16
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:49,240
So kudos to you. Okay so, with I'm doing two presentations, and between both of these presentations,

17
00:01:49,240 --> 00:01:55,780
the learning outcomes are that you will learn some stats about food insecurity in Washtenaw County,

18
00:01:55,780 --> 00:02:01,330
you'll know where to go to look at that information about food security in Washtenaw County,

19
00:02:01,330 --> 00:02:07,240
you'll be able to describe examples of how Washtenaw County Health Department, WCHD,

20
00:02:07,240 --> 00:02:13,300
first acronym, is addressing food insecurity with a couple of practical examples.

21
00:02:13,300 --> 00:02:18,940
So one of the projects was Health for All Washtenaw and Washtenaw County Food Policy Council.

22
00:02:18,940 --> 00:02:28,740
And then another one with Prescription for Health. And then, we've also had to adapt, like everything else in our world, to the pandemic.

23
00:02:28,740 --> 00:02:38,190
So I'll describe some adaptations taken to address food insecurity in a pandemic. And really throughout these presentations of mine,

24
00:02:38,190 --> 00:02:45,780
I really want you to think about, what is this theme, because there is a theme throughout all the work that we do.

25
00:02:45,780 --> 00:02:52,170
So kind of keep your eyes and ears open for that. All right.

26
00:02:52,170 --> 00:02:56,790
So with that, I just kind of want to introduce myself a little more.

27
00:02:56,790 --> 00:03:09,030
I am again Ariane Donnelly and I work for our Community Health Promotion Division and I'm a health promotion coordinator.

28
00:03:09,030 --> 00:03:13,870
And so really, a lot of what I do actually centers around food,

29
00:03:13,870 --> 00:03:19,680
and I love that. And it really centers around food insecurity, and to work to address that.

30
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:24,090
I also do a lot of different things based off of whatever grants I'm in and on too,

31
00:03:24,090 --> 00:03:28,950
so that's kind of exciting that new opportunities arise.

32
00:03:28,950 --> 00:03:37,860
And so this picture is of me doing one of my jobs, or one of my roles as the program coordinator for a prescription for health,

33
00:03:37,860 --> 00:03:41,640
and that's a program at the farmer's markets. So that's your first spoiler, about what

34
00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:48,630
we're going to talk about in the next presentation. But so I'm at the Chelsea Farmer's Market in this picture.

35
00:03:48,630 --> 00:03:53,190
I also want to share that I started working at our health department in 2011,

36
00:03:53,190 --> 00:03:58,920
so I can't believe that this is my 10 year anniversary, and I'm actually a dietitian as well.

37
00:03:58,920 --> 00:04:04,350
And so I started working at the health department in WIC, Women, Infants and Children,

38
00:04:04,350 --> 00:04:13,260
another food assistance program. And then I also was a home visiting dietitian for our maternal infant health program,

39
00:04:13,260 --> 00:04:19,460
before I transition to my current role as the health promotion coordinator.

40
00:04:19,460 --> 00:04:25,530
All right. And of course, it would be remiss of me to not mention that, of course,

41
00:04:25,530 --> 00:04:34,650
because of the pandemic that some of my roles have shifted to not only how I respond, and some of my hats that I wear, and the programs that I work in,

42
00:04:34,650 --> 00:04:40,590
but also the fact that at the beginning of the pandemic, I was doing contact tracing.

43
00:04:40,590 --> 00:04:46,940
Now I'm helping coordinate volunteers for our vaccine clinics. All right.

44
00:04:46,940 --> 00:04:52,170
So we're going to move on. Okay, so I've talked about myself,

45
00:04:52,170 --> 00:05:02,560
I just want to introduce the health department a little bit more too. So our mission is really to assure in partnership,

46
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:07,270
excuse me to assure in partnership with the community, the conditions necessary

47
00:05:07,270 --> 00:05:12,580
for people to live healthy lives through prevention and protection programs.

48
00:05:12,580 --> 00:05:18,820
And I really love this picture, this is the picture of our 2019 report, our annual report.

49
00:05:18,820 --> 00:05:25,240
And I highly suggest that you check it out. The link is down below, because we do so much at the health department.

50
00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:38,290
So not only do we do community health promotion, but we also do restaurant food inspections, and we have nurses following up on bat bites or dog bites.

51
00:05:38,290 --> 00:05:43,210
And we talk, I mentioned WIC, we have that as well. I mean, we do so much at the health department.

52
00:05:43,210 --> 00:05:46,990
So I really, really strongly encourage you to check out the reports,

53
00:05:46,990 --> 00:05:53,500
it's really cool. And this picture is of a fabulous thing that we got to do 2019, with a grant.

54
00:05:53,500 --> 00:05:57,820
We actually got to have a playground built on our space.

55
00:05:57,820 --> 00:06:08,180
So that has been really a joy to watch kids be there and play, especially with our WIC clinic while they were waiting for their appointments.

56
00:06:08,180 --> 00:06:15,110
Okay, so talked about me, talked about the health department.

57
00:06:15,110 --> 00:06:21,830
Another part I wanted to talk about, because we're, this is gonna be one of the first projects that I mention,

58
00:06:21,830 --> 00:06:25,160
The partner is the Washtenaw County Food Policy Council.

59
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:32,360
So also, one thing that I do at the Health Department, is I'm the support staff for the Washington County Food Policy Council,

60
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:38,690
and basically what I do for that is I make sure that when meetings are scheduled

61
00:06:38,690 --> 00:06:43,460
that I get public notices out to our clerk's office so they can post them,

62
00:06:43,460 --> 00:06:48,470
and I take meeting minutes and I update their website, like things like that.

63
00:06:48,470 --> 00:06:55,820
And the Washtenaw County Food Policy Council, it's a subcommittee of our Washtenaw County Board of Commissioners,

64
00:06:55,820 --> 00:07:00,980
and so our members are actually appointed by the board of commissioners.

65
00:07:00,980 --> 00:07:09,860
And the mission of the council is to increase and preserve access to safe, local and healthy food for all residents of Washington County.

66
00:07:09,860 --> 00:07:16,280
So, and they do that by looking at the lens like through policy, and the website is

67
00:07:16,280 --> 00:07:22,420
there. I encouraged to check out our website as well, to learn more.

68
00:07:22,420 --> 00:07:28,470
And all of the members are volunteers, too. I want to share that. So it's really cool and amazing.

69
00:07:28,470 --> 00:07:30,600
And speaking of the members,

70
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:38,820
there are up to 18 members on the council and they represent different perspective of the food system, and they serve two year terms,

71
00:07:38,820 --> 00:07:48,540
but they can be reappointed. So some of the different perspectives that can be highlighted in the food system, racial equity,

72
00:07:48,540 --> 00:07:58,650
public health, for example, nutrition, waste management, food service, urban agriculture, rural agriculture.

73
00:07:58,650 --> 00:08:02,250
We also have a representative from our board of commissioners on there as well.

74
00:08:02,250 --> 00:08:08,720
So lots of different sectors, but I just want to mention a few of those.

75
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:11,930
Okay, so we've talked about me,

76
00:08:11,930 --> 00:08:22,780
the health department, we've talked about the Washtenaw County Food Policy Council, and now I want to talk about a project that we worked on.

77
00:08:22,780 --> 00:08:27,860
And to introduce this project, it's talking about food insecurity in Washtenaw County.

78
00:08:27,860 --> 00:08:33,350
So here are some stats, and that first learning objectives that we're going through.

79
00:08:33,350 --> 00:08:41,450
But first, I want to talk about what food insecurity is. So Feeding America defines food insecurity,

80
00:08:41,450 --> 00:08:49,790
that it describes the households inability to provide enough food for every person to live an active, healthy life.

81
00:08:49,790 --> 00:08:58,550
And then, so to set the scene for Washington County, the average household size is two and a half people, total population

82
00:08:58,550 --> 00:09:06,770
a little over 370,000, and a little over 18% are under the age 18.

83
00:09:06,770 --> 00:09:11,410
And then so some more stats, 10.7%

84
00:09:11,410 --> 00:09:17,600
the population in Washington County has experienced food insecurity at some point in the past year.

85
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:25,370
So, and some of these stats too, just want to quickly interject, that they're like from, say, 2018 or 2015.

86
00:09:25,370 --> 00:09:33,830
These were the most recent stats we had at the time that we developed this handout, which was September of 2020,

87
00:09:33,830 --> 00:09:42,770
so this is pre-pandemic. So you can only imagine that these stats and food insecurity have only increased, unfortunately.

88
00:09:42,770 --> 00:09:50,750
So to continue on with that, six percent of the population who are considered or are considered, excuse me,

89
00:09:50,750 --> 00:09:55,610
who are considered low income and also have low access to a grocery store,

90
00:09:55,610 --> 00:10:02,330
about seven percent of adults have ever reduced food intake, because there wasn't enough money for food

91
00:10:02,330 --> 00:10:09,470
in the past year, about 40% of households received SNAP.

92
00:10:09,470 --> 00:10:18,190
Another acronym. Remember, government? But that's the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, also known as food stamps.

93
00:10:18,190 --> 00:10:25,370
And just like a little tip, I found that really the only people who say SNAP are the ones who don't use the program,

94
00:10:25,370 --> 00:10:32,780
and so there's like that kind of disconnect. So I always like to say, also known as food stamps.

95
00:10:32,780 --> 00:10:40,490
Sorry, I got off track. So 40.4% of households that receive SNAP have children.

96
00:10:40,490 --> 00:10:47,180
And 7.6% of Washington County children under the age 18 have experienced food insecurity at some point in their lives.

97
00:10:47,180 --> 00:10:53,420
So we would love for all of these stats to be zero.

98
00:10:53,420 --> 00:11:01,020
And I guess, except we love for kids to be able to have, to get benefits to eat.

99
00:11:01,020 --> 00:11:08,310
But my point is, is that we don't want anybody to be food insecure, to go hungry.

100
00:11:08,310 --> 00:11:12,240
Okay, so set the scene a little bit more.

101
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:15,120
Let's dive in to this first project.

102
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:24,060
So for the food insecurity assessment, we wanted to understand the current state of food insecurity in Washington County.

103
00:11:24,060 --> 00:11:31,080
So the Washington County Food Policy Council, subcommittee of the Board of Commissioners,

104
00:11:31,080 --> 00:11:37,950
which I am supporting staff, partnered with the Washington County Health Department, which I'm an employee of,

105
00:11:37,950 --> 00:11:45,030
and the purpose of this is really to bring partners together. So  not only did it bring the Food Policy Council together,

106
00:11:45,030 --> 00:11:54,480
whose members are present so many different organizations throughout our community, which is fabulous,

107
00:11:54,480 --> 00:12:02,900
and represent the community itself. So we wanted to bring that together with the health department and create a resource that

108
00:12:02,900 --> 00:12:08,690
would provide an overview of the state of food insecurity throughout Washtenaw County.

109
00:12:08,690 --> 00:12:14,480
And there's a lot of data. We have a ton of data on food insecurity in Washtenaw County.

110
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:18,830
But there really, you had to go like multiple different places to find it.

111
00:12:18,830 --> 00:12:23,780
So we really wanted to figure out one place and established that,

112
00:12:23,780 --> 00:12:36,060
so someone could go there and explore it. And we also wanted to share in a way that's actually going to be helpful to people, helpful to our community.

113
00:12:36,060 --> 00:12:46,740
Okay, so how we did that then, is we have this website that's maintained by us, the health department.

114
00:12:46,740 --> 00:12:50,830
Highly encourage you to go there. It's healthforallwashtenaw.org

115
00:12:50,830 --> 00:12:57,090
Because this website, it was first developed in the summer of 2019,

116
00:12:57,090 --> 00:13:04,890
and it brings together stories, numbers, and resources that illustrate the state of health in Washtenaw County.

117
00:13:04,890 --> 00:13:09,630
And like I mentioned, we want it to be useful to people, useful to our communities.

118
00:13:09,630 --> 00:13:17,880
So it's a unique site meant to provide all community members the ability to access, understand and interpret public health information.

119
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:21,420
And it's really also great because it will have some stats,

120
00:13:21,420 --> 00:13:24,270
but there are also stories built in there, so you can read that,

121
00:13:24,270 --> 00:13:30,030
and we actually have a story about this food insecurity assessment project on there.

122
00:13:30,030 --> 00:13:37,500
And in terms of aggregating all of this data into one place, we have a food insecurity dashboard.

123
00:13:37,500 --> 00:13:47,070
So you can see that here, and one of the things I love about it is it'll show with little icons like little arrows up or down and different colors.

124
00:13:47,070 --> 00:13:53,920
So I also find that just really incredibly helpful and useful.

125
00:13:53,920 --> 00:14:01,460
Okay so, we've done this project, and this was another part of our handout,

126
00:14:01,460 --> 00:14:08,720
one of the deliverables for this project, but we also really wanted to focus on food insecurity during the pandemic,

127
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:13,580
during COVID-19, because we know it's disrupted lots of lives.

128
00:14:13,580 --> 00:14:19,730
We know it's disrupted our food chain. Huge waves of unemployment.

129
00:14:19,730 --> 00:14:23,390
And we know it's disrupted people getting food in their bellies.

130
00:14:23,390 --> 00:14:31,940
So we surveyed some of our community to kind of hear some of their perspectives and what they found.

131
00:14:31,940 --> 00:14:37,960
And we have community health workers, so they're peer support staff and they work at the health department,

132
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:45,290
but they're just fabulous, because they're in the community. People really trust them,  community workers are so fabulous.

133
00:14:45,290 --> 00:14:49,250
You hear that term, like they're just amazing.

134
00:14:49,250 --> 00:14:55,460
But some of the quotes I wanted to share, that people were worried that without programs like Prescription for Health,

135
00:14:55,460 --> 00:14:58,520
which we're going to talk about in the next section,

136
00:14:58,520 --> 00:15:04,670
that they were going to have trouble finding food for themselves, because they didn't feel comfortable going into a store setting.

137
00:15:04,670 --> 00:15:10,340
You know, they were worried about their health and safety in terms of, you know, if they were going to be exposed.

138
00:15:10,340 --> 00:15:13,970
So that's a big issue. And then not only that,

139
00:15:13,970 --> 00:15:21,960
but at times, another thing that people heard was that there were limited amount of products in supermarkets too.

140
00:15:21,960 --> 00:15:27,300
So even if they could get there, they may not be able to get those items.

141
00:15:27,300 --> 00:15:39,260
And then from the health department perspective, we were talking so much about physical distancing, the socially distancing,

142
00:15:39,260 --> 00:15:45,740
but those who are food insecure, they may actually rely on people to help them get food.

143
00:15:45,740 --> 00:15:50,120
And so there, and there is that and a possible risk for transmission,

144
00:15:50,120 --> 00:15:56,150
and so how do you really mitigate that? How do you consider that through an equity lens?

145
00:15:56,150 --> 00:16:02,930
How do you do it safely and make sure that people have access to food?

146
00:16:02,930 --> 00:16:10,170
So, and this is one of the pictures that I got from one of our partners,

147
00:16:10,170 --> 00:16:14,270
and this just showed how they were safely distributing food to those in need. So

148
00:16:14,270 --> 00:16:18,120
they had boxes, you can see it's outdoors, in a tent.

149
00:16:18,120 --> 00:16:23,830
You know, the front is open, no flaps, they're wearing masks, socially distanced.

150
00:16:23,830 --> 00:16:30,260
And so it's just really great to see the community coming together to help each other.

151
00:16:30,260 --> 00:16:38,720
Okay so, we're nearing the end of the first presentation. I mentioned about a theme.

152
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:46,950
Have you found the theme? And if not, stay tuned, because the next section kind of talks about it a little bit more.

153
00:16:46,950 --> 00:16:56,480
So keep your eyes and ears open for that theme. And with that, we are done with our first section.
