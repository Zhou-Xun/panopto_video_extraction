1
00:00:02,130 --> 00:00:15,350
All right. So also any announcements from anyone, any student or any groups, any rallies, activism, downs, turnovers, strikes?

2
00:00:16,620 --> 00:00:20,759
Oh, yeah. I'm sorry. Is it? I actually have a student or meeting tonight.

3
00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:27,330
It's like one of our mass meetings is for J Street, which is like an anti-occupation, like, Israeli-Palestinian conflict type group.

4
00:00:27,640 --> 00:00:33,360
Okay. Yeah, it'll just be a mass meeting. It's like pretty informal, just getting to know people with issues about.

5
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:38,070
But that's at 8 p.m. in East Quad, I believe it's room 804.

6
00:00:38,430 --> 00:00:45,510
Okay. But, yeah, thank you. Others all right.

7
00:00:45,720 --> 00:00:49,709
Yes. Sophia All right. So I also had a mass meeting for a club.

8
00:00:49,710 --> 00:00:53,040
It'll be tomorrow at 8 p.m. I think it's in Mason Hall.

9
00:00:54,240 --> 00:00:58,350
I can send out details if anybody's interested, but it's for the kidney disease screening and awareness program.

10
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:02,160
And so what we do is we do free health screenings for underserved populations,

11
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:06,390
and we're finally able to start actually screening people again because we're shut down because of COVID.

12
00:01:06,990 --> 00:01:10,710
So if anybody's interested in that, it's tomorrow. Excellent.

13
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:14,460
Thank you. So I'm trying to figure out all the other wires and stuff.

14
00:01:15,570 --> 00:01:18,610
Then this one is dead.

15
00:01:19,110 --> 00:01:23,640
All right. Anyone else? All right.

16
00:01:23,650 --> 00:01:29,890
So, yeah, no technical skills, but it looks like this little patch is alive.

17
00:01:31,710 --> 00:01:38,200
Okay, now just bear with me while I figure out how to work this.

18
00:01:39,760 --> 00:01:45,400
So I should have paid attention more when she was teaching me about electronic devices.

19
00:01:47,380 --> 00:01:53,530
And there are two different types of batteries. That's nice. Yeah, that's lovely.

20
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:58,960
They were really good with the other guys.

21
00:02:00,740 --> 00:02:05,559
Yeah, I'm not great. So this was a work in progress.

22
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:12,930
Need to plug it into something.

23
00:02:15,670 --> 00:02:19,300
We can close the gap.

24
00:02:21,780 --> 00:02:25,150
So, is this work alone?

25
00:02:25,450 --> 00:02:28,989
No, really, this one is.

26
00:02:28,990 --> 00:02:41,020
But there's one thing on it that regrets. And then I really, really got a lot of shoving into it.

27
00:02:42,220 --> 00:03:03,600
Like, you think really funny. I was like, I think the only question everyone as you need to know if you've got a plot adapter or something like that,

28
00:03:06,490 --> 00:03:10,410
it doesn't mean as much, right? Yeah.

29
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:15,160
All right. So when's the last time this is as far as we got on the first line.

30
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:21,250
But I think we had a great conversation. Anyone remember any of the highlights of the conversation?

31
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:29,080
And then we talked a lot about different types of power, what it feels like to have power, what it feels like not to have power.

32
00:03:29,530 --> 00:03:41,410
We talked some about our very common observation about how when we talked about how it feels to have power, a lot of the comments were more negative.

33
00:03:42,550 --> 00:03:48,610
But then also point out it could have been that the fact that I first asked, how does it feel to be power less?

34
00:03:48,880 --> 00:03:52,180
So people are already kind of in a more negative mindset.

35
00:03:53,530 --> 00:03:57,430
Anything else that you remember from last week?

36
00:03:59,140 --> 00:04:03,570
Know it's been a long time. All right. I won't I won't belabor it.

37
00:04:03,580 --> 00:04:08,590
So a lot of what we talked about actually is in the slides.

38
00:04:08,770 --> 00:04:15,910
So I'm going to go through them. So we get it from a more technical perspective, too, and touch on a couple of different things.

39
00:04:16,390 --> 00:04:21,219
So a couple of people brought up the difference between Power over and Power two.

40
00:04:21,220 --> 00:04:22,660
And again, this was in the readings.

41
00:04:23,110 --> 00:04:30,370
So when one person has power over another group or dominates another group, that's often what we're talking about power over.

42
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:37,990
And usually it's meant in a negative way because power is a limited resource.

43
00:04:37,990 --> 00:04:48,520
Not everyone has it. We don't have a lot of it. So if I have power over you, that's typically seen as a negative thing and there's power to.

44
00:04:48,830 --> 00:04:56,110
So the individual ability to act on this is linked to capability or to a sense of agency.

45
00:04:56,290 --> 00:05:02,410
So if you feel like you have the power to do something, then that would be more in the positive realm.

46
00:05:03,010 --> 00:05:09,640
So who could give me an example of a situation where you would have power over someone?

47
00:05:09,790 --> 00:05:13,600
This would be pretty basic and easy. Just one like quick example.

48
00:05:14,040 --> 00:05:19,600
Yeah, it's kind of a small example, but like thinking about parents or adults who have control over.

49
00:05:19,640 --> 00:05:26,500
Totally. Exactly. Yeah. And it's not only the kind of the dynamics of reason, but it's legal power.

50
00:05:26,770 --> 00:05:27,129
Right.

51
00:05:27,130 --> 00:05:36,040
So if you're a child, you cannot legally consent to medical treatment in many places, not even mental health treatment until you're in your teens.

52
00:05:36,250 --> 00:05:45,640
So there's a lot of power. That's a huge power. What about power too much as an example, someone having power to do something or accomplish something.

53
00:05:47,430 --> 00:05:55,020
Yeah. The Parliament having the power to declare war. Something like a president having power to declare war.

54
00:05:55,920 --> 00:05:57,600
Yeah, that's definitely power.

55
00:05:58,230 --> 00:06:05,420
And that's also, though, an example of power over, too, because, you know, that person can also declare that they do declare war.

56
00:06:05,430 --> 00:06:09,510
That's that's going to impact a lot of other people. What's another example?

57
00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:14,640
Yeah. So part of. All right, exactly. So each of us has that individual power.

58
00:06:14,940 --> 00:06:20,099
So you see, even when we when we're talking about people that have the power to that can range all the way from

59
00:06:20,100 --> 00:06:27,360
somebody like I have the power to decide if I want to go to class or not all the way up to going to war.

60
00:06:27,510 --> 00:06:32,760
So there's a lot a lot of different reasons, all kinds of power to power with.

61
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:38,010
So this is collective action. So the ability to act together to bring about change.

62
00:06:38,250 --> 00:06:44,520
What might be an example of power with something like that, I might add?

63
00:06:44,520 --> 00:06:47,489
You haven't, Henry. I don't know.

64
00:06:47,490 --> 00:06:55,890
I was thinking about, like, a group of people writing a petition for, like, a restaurant or have, like, scary enough.

65
00:06:55,980 --> 00:07:02,940
Exactly. Yeah, I've. I've seen examples of a bunch of people getting together, writing a petition, and using their collective voice.

66
00:07:03,210 --> 00:07:08,430
So just if you just walked in and said, hey, I want this on the menu, they might be like, Oh, that's nice.

67
00:07:08,700 --> 00:07:16,080
See you later. But they have like 5000 people to sign a petition and then people are going to lesson power within.

68
00:07:16,410 --> 00:07:20,280
So this is individual, our collective self-worth and dignity.

69
00:07:20,280 --> 00:07:24,750
So this is more of a, you know, individual level, internal process.

70
00:07:25,890 --> 00:07:32,760
And this often the power then may go with the power to you may actually have power with then.

71
00:07:32,760 --> 00:07:40,110
So you could have feelings of self-worth and feeling like you can do something.

72
00:07:40,290 --> 00:07:45,090
But there may be physical limitations, policy limitations, other things like that.

73
00:07:45,390 --> 00:07:51,720
So you may not be able to act also with power within it's both individual and collective.

74
00:07:52,170 --> 00:08:02,820
So there's concepts in the field of psychology where people talk about collective or community self-efficacy or community empowerment,

75
00:08:03,060 --> 00:08:06,390
where there's a group of people that feel like they can actually do something.

76
00:08:08,310 --> 00:08:11,640
What's an example of that? You know, and think of an example.

77
00:08:15,670 --> 00:08:19,670
I'm sorry. I'm thinking about a representation.

78
00:08:19,690 --> 00:08:27,330
So maybe seeing someone who looks like yourself in a place that you want to be and feeling like you're capable of being, too.

79
00:08:27,560 --> 00:08:35,110
Mm hmm. So that's a, I think, a really good example. Like for the individual seeing that or the group seeing that, that can lead to power within,

80
00:08:35,290 --> 00:08:38,890
because then they can see and be like, Oh, yeah, I can do that.

81
00:08:38,920 --> 00:08:48,760
That is something that is possible. Excellent. So other advice people talk about visible power.

82
00:08:48,940 --> 00:08:53,560
So an invisible power.

83
00:08:54,040 --> 00:08:57,639
Uh, it's. It can show up in different ways.

84
00:08:57,640 --> 00:09:11,110
So one way is it can show up in, like, physical spaces. So spaces can be created to show that one person or one group of people is in charge.

85
00:09:11,710 --> 00:09:15,340
It can also be in the way that decisions are made.

86
00:09:15,370 --> 00:09:21,400
So, again, academic institutions are really great examples of forms of power, visible power.

87
00:09:21,790 --> 00:09:25,450
Yeah, as I talked about, the classroom setup is a power dynamic.

88
00:09:25,980 --> 00:09:29,050
You're sitting in a row looking at me.

89
00:09:29,290 --> 00:09:32,810
I'm at the podium. That's a power dynamic policy.

90
00:09:32,830 --> 00:09:40,660
So grading policies, I mean, you know, the fact that I assign a grade to you is a visible show of power.

91
00:09:40,960 --> 00:09:50,800
Right. So even though we can attempt to break down some of the power dynamics, even with a critical pedagogy approach, at the end of the day,

92
00:09:50,890 --> 00:10:02,080
we're working within a system where I have to assign a letter that represents your performance, and that is an inherent, visible power structure.

93
00:10:04,210 --> 00:10:07,980
A lot of times when people are talking about visible power, they're also talking about like governmental bodies.

94
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:14,050
You're talking about presidents. You could also talk about things like Congress governing groups here.

95
00:10:15,580 --> 00:10:29,680
I was just listening to something new last night about some similar challenges at Michigan State where the president and the third board of directors,

96
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:36,890
whatever the reasons, thank you, are not real thrilled with his performance.

97
00:10:37,330 --> 00:10:44,620
So, you know, that's another very visible power structure where it's very clear that at the end of the day,

98
00:10:44,620 --> 00:10:48,910
the regents can, you know, basically get rid of someone if they want to.

99
00:10:50,470 --> 00:11:01,060
Now, the thing is with this last one is that organizations can well, two different things.

100
00:11:02,350 --> 00:11:09,370
One thing is that organizations can actually create systems to address the visible power.

101
00:11:09,370 --> 00:11:21,300
So. So let's say if the regents had a more transparent system where they took community input and it was very clear how this was happening.

102
00:11:22,630 --> 00:11:37,150
That does kind of start to break down some of the power also within structures that are trying to assert their power or gain power.

103
00:11:39,250 --> 00:11:44,800
They can organize in such ways that they either display power visibly or not.

104
00:11:45,130 --> 00:11:58,450
So if you have a collective of people that are trying to get together to change policies around what can we change policies around?

105
00:11:58,990 --> 00:12:03,070
Um. Immunizations.

106
00:12:04,270 --> 00:12:13,420
So let's say you have a group of concerned parents that are getting together to try and change policy.

107
00:12:14,980 --> 00:12:22,680
They can. Create their structures in different ways where even though they may not be in a position of power,

108
00:12:22,680 --> 00:12:27,820
they're trying to gain that they can create structures that either visibly show power or don't show power.

109
00:12:27,860 --> 00:12:29,850
So and it could go either way.

110
00:12:29,860 --> 00:12:36,660
So, you know, because when you're trying to fight people in power, sometimes you have to talk their language in order to get power.

111
00:12:37,080 --> 00:12:46,830
And so if even if you're trying to create a system that's more of a level kind of organizational structure,

112
00:12:47,070 --> 00:12:56,520
it still could be that that's not the people that you're trying to gain power from may not respond to that as well.

113
00:12:57,630 --> 00:13:07,709
There's also hidden power. So and this this happens all the time, you know, on porches like and again, that's part of how oppression works.

114
00:13:07,710 --> 00:13:10,740
And when Paulo Freyre talks about critical consciousness,

115
00:13:11,880 --> 00:13:19,350
sometimes people have hidden power and they want that hidden power because they don't want you to know who's really pulling the strings.

116
00:13:20,220 --> 00:13:27,150
And so by doing that, it can keep you more oppressed because you don't really know who to fight or how to fight.

117
00:13:29,700 --> 00:13:31,950
And, you know, with this.

118
00:13:35,820 --> 00:13:45,570
People can be really tricky and how they create systems of hidden power to the point where you have really no idea who's in charge.

119
00:13:47,730 --> 00:13:55,080
I'm going to use a stupid example, but does anyone ever see the show Snowpiercer?

120
00:13:56,040 --> 00:14:01,079
Because it's like train. Okay, so I've only seen like a couple of episodes,

121
00:14:01,080 --> 00:14:10,110
but I think the idea you can correct me if I'm wrong is like the world is ending or something I think because of global warming or some crap.

122
00:14:10,500 --> 00:14:14,670
So someone built this giant train and people are living on the train.

123
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:23,070
There's all these dynamics anyway. So everyone thinks that the person running the train is this mister somebody.

124
00:14:24,360 --> 00:14:28,170
But it's really being run by this woman who is kind of seen.

125
00:14:28,180 --> 00:14:34,020
I don't know what her role is like, her business assistant or director of services anyway,

126
00:14:34,410 --> 00:14:40,380
but basically she's a really smart engineer and she's like, you know, doing all the the work, making the train work and all this.

127
00:14:41,550 --> 00:14:48,450
It's definitely a case of hidden power because no one really knows that she's pulling all the strings, she's all making all the decisions.

128
00:14:49,650 --> 00:14:57,090
And so it's it's a way to really control people even better, because if you're like,

129
00:14:57,090 --> 00:15:01,469
oh, you know, that's not my decision, but I'll go talk to Mr. So-and-so about that.

130
00:15:01,470 --> 00:15:04,140
You know, I would do that if it were up to me. Of course I would do that.

131
00:15:04,440 --> 00:15:10,200
But, you know, he's in charge, so and then that way you stay in their graces.

132
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:15,210
They're like, Oh, they're so nice. They're trying to help me out when really they're the ones call the shop door.

133
00:15:15,870 --> 00:15:19,439
So. So if you really want to have power over people, that's it.

134
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:22,889
That's what we're teaching to do. Yeah, it is.

135
00:15:22,890 --> 00:15:28,830
Unfortunately, there are a lot of forms of hidden power where.

136
00:15:30,450 --> 00:15:38,250
It's almost impossible to find out who's really politician now in different spaces in society,

137
00:15:38,520 --> 00:15:43,169
like nonprofit organizations and and to a certain extent, governmental agencies.

138
00:15:43,170 --> 00:15:47,400
There's been a push for more transparency. So we really know who's pulling the strings.

139
00:15:47,790 --> 00:15:55,350
So, for instance, in a lot of nonprofit organizations, you have to show your board of directors.

140
00:15:55,620 --> 00:16:01,649
You have to be very clear what their background is. Also, nonprofits are good ones.

141
00:16:01,650 --> 00:16:09,810
The three also have to make their tax records accessible so that there's that level of transparency.

142
00:16:10,110 --> 00:16:14,820
And then even for some grants with nonprofits,

143
00:16:15,210 --> 00:16:24,870
you have to have a certain number of people on your board that represent different identity or constituent groups that you're trying to serve.

144
00:16:25,200 --> 00:16:34,910
So, for instance, if you have an organization that serving low income women in Detroit, there might be regulations around it.

145
00:16:35,640 --> 00:16:40,530
On the board, you have to have at least 50% women or more.

146
00:16:40,770 --> 00:16:43,920
You have to have at least X percent that are from Detroit.

147
00:16:44,370 --> 00:16:47,909
So you want to have that representation. Does this make sense?

148
00:16:47,910 --> 00:16:53,730
What hidden power, what we're talking about? Can't think of another example of a place where there may be hidden power.

149
00:16:54,990 --> 00:17:01,350
Because, again, this hidden power is tricky because you don't always know that you're caught up in it.

150
00:17:02,850 --> 00:17:06,390
Yeah. Like the CDC. Okay. Tell me more about that.

151
00:17:06,840 --> 00:17:13,910
Well, I feel like it's really easy to blame them for some of the COVID policies or safety guidelines being put out.

152
00:17:13,920 --> 00:17:21,570
But in actuality, the current presidential administration controls information they're allowed to is right.

153
00:17:22,020 --> 00:17:26,579
And that's a really, really great one. Yeah. I mean, the CDC is a tricky place.

154
00:17:26,580 --> 00:17:33,330
And as I said before, it's like when we have a change in the president and the presidential administration, the CDC changes.

155
00:17:33,690 --> 00:17:42,810
And so, you know, even though the director of the CDC does have some say, but again, that person is beholden to the president.

156
00:17:43,650 --> 00:17:52,140
So even if they would want to say something or put something forward, it doesn't mean it's going to happen if it's a great example.

157
00:17:52,470 --> 00:18:01,200
Any other examples that threaten investors in like a corporate setting or startups or anything?

158
00:18:01,290 --> 00:18:04,829
Yeah, exactly. Exactly. And that's something to I mean,

159
00:18:04,830 --> 00:18:15,140
I would always encourage you if you're going to either volunteer for or donate to or even work for different organizations.

160
00:18:15,570 --> 00:18:21,840
I would follow the trail to see who's funding that. So there are.

161
00:18:25,890 --> 00:18:33,120
There's been an increase, I think, in private companies investing in both education and public health,

162
00:18:35,010 --> 00:18:44,580
and they're not always doing it for the right reason. So I can give you an example that that I've been frustrated with.

163
00:18:44,610 --> 00:18:51,270
So have you heard of Coursera? And they can get online degrees and all that other kind of stuff.

164
00:18:51,630 --> 00:18:56,700
So University of Michigan is is connected with Coursera.

165
00:18:57,420 --> 00:19:02,580
We even offer online master's of public health degree here.

166
00:19:03,930 --> 00:19:18,030
And when you follow the chain of who runs Coursera, it was really developed by a bunch of folks that were corporate investors, other folks like that.

167
00:19:18,030 --> 00:19:26,460
And if you look at their business processes, very little of the money actually goes back to the people that are doing the education.

168
00:19:27,990 --> 00:19:36,120
So a number of faculty have done courses for them and were promised certain rights and those rights were not given.

169
00:19:36,690 --> 00:19:45,330
So I have a colleague that had to teach an online course and she didn't like the way that they were using her material.

170
00:19:46,110 --> 00:19:51,630
And she had no rights to maintain that, even though that was her intellectual property.

171
00:19:52,680 --> 00:19:53,909
And that, unfortunately,

172
00:19:53,910 --> 00:20:03,120
has happened with a number of these online platforms that the really the the intent is the dollars and it's not really the education.

173
00:20:03,180 --> 00:20:08,970
Yeah. Something I was thinking about is like political action committees are different.

174
00:20:09,330 --> 00:20:14,410
Like, there are a lot of candidates running like a big one obviously is like the funding.

175
00:20:14,650 --> 00:20:17,820
Right. Yeah, exactly.

176
00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:21,219
And some of them like that are unfortunate. They're very visible.

177
00:20:21,220 --> 00:20:23,160
Also, it's not always hidden. But yeah,

178
00:20:23,160 --> 00:20:33,240
there's a lot of PACs when you look at who's contributing and who's donating and then how much of it actually is going to supporting the campaign.

179
00:20:33,960 --> 00:20:36,450
You know, there's a lot of that going on right now with, you know,

180
00:20:36,450 --> 00:20:42,600
Trump and his crew and looking at the mismanagement, misuse of funds and even in public health,

181
00:20:42,660 --> 00:20:50,250
you know, I'd be really cautious to there you know, I've seen an increase in the number of public,

182
00:20:50,460 --> 00:20:54,990
not public, but private entities that are doing public health work.

183
00:20:55,290 --> 00:21:01,500
And that makes me nervous sometimes because they're not always doing it for the right reasons.

184
00:21:01,800 --> 00:21:09,240
Our public health consulting wage that we're consulting does is like that's a license to do whatever the [INAUDIBLE] you want.

185
00:21:10,650 --> 00:21:17,820
And I know I've had students here who have like interned with some of these consulting firms and

186
00:21:17,820 --> 00:21:23,220
they're basically just chop shops where they go in and they try and get the bottom line down.

187
00:21:23,430 --> 00:21:29,400
And they don't really care about health care. But health care is, you know, billion dollar industry.

188
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:34,520
And so they're they're using corporate mechanisms,

189
00:21:34,560 --> 00:21:42,750
strategies to get the money to a certain point without any really care for what happens to people at your level.

190
00:21:42,750 --> 00:21:50,969
Have you heard anything with like my colleague Peter said with with with in your arena of like doctoral students,

191
00:21:50,970 --> 00:21:55,830
have you heard anything from other students about any of the disparity?

192
00:21:56,340 --> 00:22:06,150
But I feel like maybe I'm just not into yet, like with some of the external things when I go on, you know, I think I'm learning more about it.

193
00:22:06,540 --> 00:22:14,099
Okay. Yeah, yeah. And be careful. Like for, you know, those about all of your public health students, you know,

194
00:22:14,100 --> 00:22:22,799
some of these firms are with will present what looks like really amazing summer internship opportunities.

195
00:22:22,800 --> 00:22:31,680
Just be really careful what they're actually doing and make sure that it aligns with your political and social justice views.

196
00:22:32,790 --> 00:22:41,040
Yeah, because I've just had a number of students in the past to. Didn't follow the trail of the money and ended up having a really bad experience.

197
00:22:44,220 --> 00:22:52,290
See? So invisible power, which is a little bit different than the hidden power.

198
00:22:54,850 --> 00:23:01,390
And this has to do with the more kind of more dominant ideologies and viewpoints or perspectives.

199
00:23:01,400 --> 00:23:07,209
So, you know, people often talk about demonic masculinity, which is, you know,

200
00:23:07,210 --> 00:23:11,860
belief systems that a culture adopts for how a man should I call man should behave.

201
00:23:12,220 --> 00:23:25,590
A lot of those aspects of hegemonic masculinity are anti-sexual or gender, minorities, anti-women, dominance, anger, you know, other things like that.

202
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:34,389
And so with those invisible forms of power, they can be really tricky because they become really internalized.

203
00:23:34,390 --> 00:23:38,580
And that's why sometimes it's also referred to as internalization of powerlessness.

204
00:23:38,590 --> 00:23:45,190
So if you accept those dominant cultural messages, you may not even try to change that.

205
00:23:46,840 --> 00:23:57,280
So, for instance, just this morning, I was on a call with folks for a project we're doing in Kenya for the lesbian, BI and queer women.

206
00:23:57,280 --> 00:24:08,109
And it's all about power and empowerment and powerlessness. And we were just talking about how there's different scales that international

207
00:24:08,110 --> 00:24:13,930
organizations and international entities use to measure empowerment among women.

208
00:24:15,130 --> 00:24:21,790
And a lot of the items, I would say most items are actually about the woman in relation to a man.

209
00:24:22,330 --> 00:24:27,630
So there's a whole like factor on their views on white beading.

210
00:24:29,350 --> 00:24:36,820
So those prices are literally, you know, do you think it's acceptable if a husband beats his wife, if she burns dinner?

211
00:24:36,970 --> 00:24:39,100
I mean, that's actually an item on the scale.

212
00:24:40,660 --> 00:24:53,710
And we were having this conversation about how so many women have been really dominated by these cultural values,

213
00:24:54,100 --> 00:24:57,490
that women are second class citizens.

214
00:24:57,550 --> 00:25:04,750
And so if her husband does something to harm her, then she deserves it.

215
00:25:05,740 --> 00:25:09,550
And it's really just this like, again, this internalization of powerlessness.

216
00:25:11,020 --> 00:25:16,959
There's all kinds of issues we're working on really challenging notions of empowerment,

217
00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:21,550
especially for we're talking about lesbian buying queer women all the times they don't have a male partner,

218
00:25:21,550 --> 00:25:27,700
they don't have a female partner or other things like that and not be married.

219
00:25:27,700 --> 00:25:38,890
But there's such ingrained norms and ideas about what women should do, how women should be also with men.

220
00:25:39,730 --> 00:25:44,820
If you don't have if you're not married to a woman, if you don't have a child, that is seen as dishonorable.

221
00:25:44,860 --> 00:25:55,629
So a number of the young gay men that I work with are forced into marriages in order to save face for the family or will have a

222
00:25:55,630 --> 00:26:04,720
child as a way to again save the reputation of the family because it can bring the whole family's name down and a community.

223
00:26:05,230 --> 00:26:16,270
So I think those are examples of these dominant ideologies that are so intense that people feel like there's just there's no way to change that.

224
00:26:16,630 --> 00:26:23,730
So one of the young men that I worked with for ten years when I was in Kenya over the summer, you know, told me,

225
00:26:24,820 --> 00:26:28,300
even though we talked about what's up all the time, he'd like to tell me he got married and has a child.

226
00:26:30,160 --> 00:26:37,060
So, you know, we were there and we were talking and and he's like, I, you know, I couldn't I had to do it.

227
00:26:37,210 --> 00:26:42,700
You know, there was my family threatened to disown me and, you know, all these other kind of things.

228
00:26:42,700 --> 00:26:46,120
And so it's such an intense power that he really felt trapped.

229
00:26:47,080 --> 00:26:52,100
And that's an example of some of the invisible power. All right.

230
00:26:52,540 --> 00:26:55,780
You know, this is I'm going to skip this activity.

231
00:26:55,840 --> 00:27:03,190
I thought it was more exciting, but it's really not. So other people talk about power as a resource.

232
00:27:03,940 --> 00:27:06,190
There's different thoughts on power is domination.

233
00:27:06,580 --> 00:27:21,850
And even in some spaces, looking at sexuality and even in some queer theory spaces, people talk about domination in terms of like BDSM,

234
00:27:21,850 --> 00:27:28,720
but about how people may give up power in sexual situations or an intimate situations,

235
00:27:29,860 --> 00:27:36,310
but have kind of a safety valve for when they want that domination to stop.

236
00:27:36,580 --> 00:27:41,830
So even though we often talk about powerlessness as an undesirable state,

237
00:27:42,700 --> 00:27:50,290
there may be certain spaces where people desire it, but for more limited times, and it can be connected more with pleasure.

238
00:27:50,680 --> 00:27:54,270
So that's one thing that.

239
00:27:54,350 --> 00:28:01,850
It's been talked about in some of the queer studies work. And again, that's the dyadic relationship of dominance and subordination.

240
00:28:03,050 --> 00:28:10,940
And then also power is intersectional. And I think everything that we do and talk about in here, obviously we're talking about intersectionality.

241
00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:20,060
Now, how many people have read or heard about Michelle who go, okay, what were classes?

242
00:28:20,060 --> 00:28:30,590
Do you remember where you heard about him? He was in a sociology of sex class as opposed to other people.

243
00:28:32,120 --> 00:28:40,040
I mean, sometimes it's more often is is in sexuality studies, queer studies, some feminist studies, things like that.

244
00:28:40,490 --> 00:28:43,969
So his work is it's interesting.

245
00:28:43,970 --> 00:28:51,170
It's kind of another one of these like people that like it gives me a headache to read and I'm not sure I understand most of it,

246
00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:59,030
but I feel like I'm kind of a basic guy and I'm telling Read that over and over, like, like what's us, what's the state, what's the system?

247
00:29:00,410 --> 00:29:10,130
But he talks about how power can be productive and that it's not always just.

248
00:29:13,170 --> 00:29:20,910
Kind of a negative thing in some ways. And again, sometimes it's sometimes it's linked to sexuality in terms of that, sometimes not.

249
00:29:22,620 --> 00:29:27,720
This third bullet here says power is not something that is exclusively localized in government and state,

250
00:29:28,110 --> 00:29:31,530
rather powers exercised through the social body.

251
00:29:32,850 --> 00:29:38,010
And again, his his writing is such that it's it's kind of, you know,

252
00:29:38,130 --> 00:29:46,920
kind of hard to take quite grasp what he may mean exactly by the social what is that the social organizations and structures.

253
00:29:48,060 --> 00:30:00,540
But he does talk about power at multiple levels and about how power is often used in like a war like manner and usually talk about power over.

254
00:30:01,590 --> 00:30:11,520
I just raised his his definition to to to keep in mind that when we're talking about issues like power and talking about in public health,

255
00:30:11,520 --> 00:30:17,700
I think we often look at it very simplistically and we don't often look in other disciplines.

256
00:30:17,700 --> 00:30:24,600
So it's really good to read outside of your discipline and to look at other people's conceptualizations of power.

257
00:30:24,750 --> 00:30:32,760
So I think sometimes in public health we have a very simplistic view of power and empowerment, and I think the term empowerment is way overused.

258
00:30:34,200 --> 00:30:38,249
It's like, Oh, we're going to empower you. What the [INAUDIBLE] does that mean?

259
00:30:38,250 --> 00:30:46,920
And again, as I've said before, do I want to be empowered and can another person really empower another person?

260
00:30:47,730 --> 00:30:51,810
And they may help create ways to gain power.

261
00:30:52,230 --> 00:30:59,580
But depending on how you view power and empowerment, it's really much more of an internal kind of process.

262
00:31:00,330 --> 00:31:04,229
I think we're all power now. Are you all powered out? All right, cool.

263
00:31:04,230 --> 00:31:08,639
Yeah. I can see the phases building on my. I'm so privileged.

264
00:31:08,640 --> 00:31:11,890
We've talked a little bit about privilege. You know, one thing that I.

265
00:31:12,450 --> 00:31:18,209
I want to put this in there. That's first of all, because if you again, at the very beginning of the class,

266
00:31:18,210 --> 00:31:26,670
I talked about how we are often very ahistorical and our are thinking and we don't think about the roots of where things are coming from.

267
00:31:27,270 --> 00:31:38,549
And so, you know, often time Peggy Mackintosh, there was a white woman, wrote this paper in 1988 called White Privilege and Male Privilege,

268
00:31:38,550 --> 00:31:43,410
a personal kind of coming to see correspondences through work at women's studies.

269
00:31:43,590 --> 00:31:48,120
And so people often associate privilege with her.

270
00:31:48,360 --> 00:31:54,030
But if you really go back to earlier writings of W.E.B. Dubois,

271
00:31:55,110 --> 00:32:04,770
a black scholar and kind of thought leader, he actually talked about privilege in the 1930s.

272
00:32:05,190 --> 00:32:17,280
So he talked about the psychological wage that black workers experience, that white workers don't.

273
00:32:17,460 --> 00:32:30,300
And so that there is extra stress involved with being black and working in factories and in other industrial places.

274
00:32:30,780 --> 00:32:34,229
And he was basically talking about white privilege.

275
00:32:34,230 --> 00:32:42,750
So the white workers didn't have to deal with all the stuff that the black workers had to deal with.

276
00:32:43,170 --> 00:32:50,640
And so even though he didn't really coined the term, the concepts or things that he wrote about a long time ago.

277
00:32:50,880 --> 00:33:00,630
And so I just like to put that historical context out there because again, I think oftentimes we we live free.

278
00:33:00,960 --> 00:33:06,720
We give more privilege to people in a privileged position as a white cis woman in women's

279
00:33:06,720 --> 00:33:13,530
studies is going to have more power than even someone that we see now is famous.

280
00:33:13,770 --> 00:33:20,190
That would be the W.E.B. Dubois. By the 1930s, he was a still black man in America, dealing with a lot of [INAUDIBLE].

281
00:33:21,120 --> 00:33:28,800
And so he's often not. Credited with all the work that he did.

282
00:33:28,980 --> 00:33:34,110
And we talked in class before about how college is seen as an unearned benefit given to people who fit into

283
00:33:34,110 --> 00:33:44,459
a specific social group and how society just grants people privileges because of those identities we see,

284
00:33:44,460 --> 00:33:55,410
implicitly or so, privilege is also the other side of oppression.

285
00:33:55,830 --> 00:34:06,930
So when people experience privilege, then if one person is privileged, then the other person is not right.

286
00:34:06,930 --> 00:34:15,690
And so that person who doesn't have privilege then is most likely experiencing some forms of oppression.

287
00:34:17,100 --> 00:34:24,330
And when we think about privilege, it's really important for us to think about it within the context of the different multiple systems of power.

288
00:34:24,720 --> 00:34:34,020
So if we're looking at privilege in an academic institution, that's very different than looking at privilege within a community based organization.

289
00:34:34,380 --> 00:34:40,050
Our privilege within an incarceration facility or privilege would then say a hospital.

290
00:34:41,900 --> 00:34:53,790
And as we think about pros or we think about privilege, intersectionality, we know, too, that that privilege may fluctuate depending on your setting.

291
00:34:54,360 --> 00:35:00,479
So because we all have intersectional identities, some of you may have privilege in this space,

292
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:07,320
but then walk across campus and be in a different space and not have the same degree of privilege or vice versa.

293
00:35:07,770 --> 00:35:16,200
And so we always have to think about the systems and structures within which we're working, but then also our identities as well.

294
00:35:16,650 --> 00:35:22,500
And so, you know, it lists here a number of different systems of patriarchy, racism, heterosexism,

295
00:35:22,860 --> 00:35:31,050
cis sexism, classism, multiple different ways in which some people may have more power over other.

296
00:35:32,560 --> 00:35:35,860
So got a question for I. I've been talking a lot. You've been sitting a lot.

297
00:35:37,150 --> 00:35:44,720
Why do we even want to talk about privilege in public health? And then it's a cool topic to talk about.

298
00:35:45,230 --> 00:35:52,370
But why is this even important? Yeah, I mean, I think when we think about solving public health issues,

299
00:35:52,370 --> 00:35:56,780
we have to recognize that those solutions are not equitably available to everyone.

300
00:35:57,050 --> 00:36:03,740
And I think that's important to recognize if we want to actually be able to fix the problem.

301
00:36:03,800 --> 00:36:07,160
Mm hmm. Good. What else? Why else?

302
00:36:07,220 --> 00:36:16,220
Violence. Are we talking about this? Yeah. I feel like privilege has been in public health as much as like public health is.

303
00:36:16,220 --> 00:36:22,340
Obviously for everyone we spend and we've seen ways that institutions today,

304
00:36:22,340 --> 00:36:29,740
we have thought to be like equitable have big differences and discriminatory parts like about think about

305
00:36:29,780 --> 00:36:36,679
like the Tuskegee syphilis right where you look at forms of exploitation like health care and medicine,

306
00:36:36,680 --> 00:36:45,920
or just like litigating indigenous communities and their environmental needs and so on.

307
00:36:46,140 --> 00:36:49,879
Yeah, yeah. It's I think it's you know, it is really important.

308
00:36:49,880 --> 00:36:59,000
Again, going back to history, it's important to to know where the field has been in order to understand not only just where we are today,

309
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:03,710
but how people perceive you when you're coming in and saying that you're when you're working in public health.

310
00:37:04,160 --> 00:37:14,899
You know, we have a huge disaster, you know, not far from here with one that is one of the worst public health disasters, you know, in this country.

311
00:37:14,900 --> 00:37:21,950
And it's right in our backyard. So and you about didn't really do much to address the issue.

312
00:37:22,250 --> 00:37:27,200
So when we come in, it's like, oh, we're from you on public. Oh, yeah, no, get out of here.

313
00:37:28,550 --> 00:37:37,730
And it's interesting because even when some of this was going on, they were recruiting and some faculty, myself included.

314
00:37:37,730 --> 00:37:47,680
I wasn't able to do it, though, to try and help mend the community relations, because there there was just so much harm that was was done.

315
00:37:47,680 --> 00:37:51,080
And, you know, and I basically told them, I'm not the person to do that.

316
00:37:51,260 --> 00:37:55,339
I'm a white, you know, dude, not from this area.

317
00:37:55,340 --> 00:38:04,700
You need to be talking to people from Flint, people who share more identities, connections with the community.

318
00:38:05,330 --> 00:38:11,780
Why else do we want to talk about privilege in public? Um, yeah. And I think it's really closely related to the social determinants of public health.

319
00:38:12,080 --> 00:38:20,000
Okay. Tell me more about that. I agree with you. Um, like, for example, if you live in like a higher class neighborhood,

320
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:26,840
you're more likely to have more space around you or at least like be able to drive to somewhere that's

321
00:38:26,840 --> 00:38:32,810
green space where you're able to enjoy that and get exercise and like experience the benefits of that,

322
00:38:32,930 --> 00:38:38,150
right? Yeah. Excellent. And you know, we do talk a lot about social determinants of health.

323
00:38:38,330 --> 00:38:43,129
And like you said, I mean, you have to talk about privilege if you're going to talk about social determinants of health,

324
00:38:43,130 --> 00:38:49,970
because really the social determinants of health are about where we live, where we work, where we play, and where we grow up, where we do.

325
00:38:49,970 --> 00:38:56,900
All this has a huge impact on our health. Well, all of those things are parts of privilege, right?

326
00:38:56,900 --> 00:39:00,710
So if we're in a community where there's a playground that's privilege,

327
00:39:01,190 --> 00:39:09,020
if you can walk to your car without having to worry about being attacked, that's a privilege.

328
00:39:09,140 --> 00:39:13,550
You know, there's so many different levels. If you can get fresh groceries, that's privilege.

329
00:39:13,790 --> 00:39:22,759
Excellent. Yeah. Oh, even having access to information on how to protect yourself is a kind of a privilege,

330
00:39:22,760 --> 00:39:29,690
because sometimes information, especially during a pandemic, was purposely presented in a way that was confusing,

331
00:39:29,690 --> 00:39:32,570
or I guess led by a lot of propaganda,

332
00:39:33,290 --> 00:39:40,040
saying that it's just not easily accessible information if you don't have the background to understand what's being presented.

333
00:39:40,040 --> 00:39:42,050
Right. Yeah, and that's a really good point.

334
00:39:42,470 --> 00:39:50,990
You know that the information well what having access to information and one being able to consume that information,

335
00:39:50,990 --> 00:39:59,059
both of those are forms of privilege. And you know, again, I think that, you know, with with COVID, I think, you know,

336
00:39:59,060 --> 00:40:06,389
our country really messed up in terms of its public health approach because everything was led by medical doctors.

337
00:40:06,390 --> 00:40:15,860
So if you think about it, so and and they were actually I was part of a group of health behavior voters that wrote letters and

338
00:40:16,160 --> 00:40:22,190
offered to work with people on a governmental level to bring in more social behavioral scientists,

339
00:40:22,190 --> 00:40:24,710
to work on messaging and to make it more accessible.

340
00:40:25,010 --> 00:40:32,959
And it didn't go anywhere because they were relying on, if you think about it, all the faces of COVID,

341
00:40:32,960 --> 00:40:41,810
the people who are in charge and even to this day are primarily on these, you know, 40 oh oh.

342
00:40:41,870 --> 00:40:47,240
Tony Blinken, the director, Rochelle, the CDC.

343
00:40:48,320 --> 00:40:56,000
Yeah, we're so well and it's terrible because I know her. So some days the brain just doesn't work.

344
00:40:57,200 --> 00:41:03,560
Yeah. I mean, she's an M.D., you know, if you watch on the news, a lot of times, if they bring in an expert,

345
00:41:03,920 --> 00:41:08,840
it's usually an M.D., even though you would want to bring in epidemiology.

346
00:41:08,900 --> 00:41:18,560
Just who. That's what we study. But, you know, and even if they do bring in an epidemiologist, it's usually an M.D.

347
00:41:19,040 --> 00:41:24,200
They've got their MPH while they were in med school, as opposed to someone who has a piece in epidemiology.

348
00:41:24,230 --> 00:41:28,700
Yeah, Marion, I was just I just had a follow up about that because I talked about this another time.

349
00:41:28,770 --> 00:41:35,719
I think it's interesting that you're just talking about the history of like maybe like vaccine hesitancy with like everything happened,

350
00:41:35,720 --> 00:41:41,299
like Tuskegee, for example. And then you. Like, all this information is given by medical doctors.

351
00:41:41,300 --> 00:41:48,440
And then you see people with historical interest rates of medical doctors not taking the vaccine.

352
00:41:48,830 --> 00:41:53,150
And then they're like, why is this happening? Right. Like, it's just seems like logic.

353
00:41:53,570 --> 00:41:59,840
Yeah, I know. I have. I was like, if I were around the world, that would be I mean, one thing I guess you are saying I mean,

354
00:41:59,840 --> 00:42:06,709
one thing that I have been impressed with was some of the campaigning that that's

355
00:42:06,710 --> 00:42:12,350
happened coming out of Detroit about showing doctors of different ethnic,

356
00:42:12,350 --> 00:42:19,190
racial backgrounds and nurses and, you know, people saying, oh, I got the vaccine, things like that.

357
00:42:19,190 --> 00:42:24,880
So they're showing like real everyday people. I think that's been some of that came really, really super late really like.

358
00:42:24,890 --> 00:42:32,600
Yeah, yeah. I was just going to comment on like the idea of privilege and public health, especially because I think that, you know,

359
00:42:32,600 --> 00:42:38,959
you are going to be in the field someday, you'll be working in various entities and there's a lot of privilege and one,

360
00:42:38,960 --> 00:42:43,520
getting your education here and then being able to do like public health work and like

361
00:42:43,670 --> 00:42:49,489
our privilege as like public health professionals really help dictate what gets done,

362
00:42:49,490 --> 00:42:55,879
what doesn't, what gets ignored, what gets, you know, supported both financially and like with the work that we do.

363
00:42:55,880 --> 00:43:03,709
So I think that privilege is something definitely for all of us to understand because it really impacts the way we see things,

364
00:43:03,710 --> 00:43:08,810
like the way we like think about things like what we deem as important and not important.

365
00:43:08,810 --> 00:43:14,000
And so I think that that's something that we all definitely need to think about as we go through, like, you know,

366
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:18,889
our education and then eventually like in the work space because that really has like true impact, you know,

367
00:43:18,890 --> 00:43:24,860
like if you don't think that something is important because, you know, your privilege has allowed you to ignore certain things, then,

368
00:43:25,130 --> 00:43:30,920
you know, like thinking about threat to like that, the privilege like of the fact that, um, didn't really like help with that.

369
00:43:30,920 --> 00:43:36,979
That's a privilege that this institution has to, like, ignore things that impact like actual lives.

370
00:43:36,980 --> 00:43:40,070
So. So, yeah, those are some things I always think about with.

371
00:43:40,600 --> 00:43:46,090
Right. Yeah, I agree with that. Yeah. So I kind of wanted to bring up like this.

372
00:43:48,330 --> 00:43:52,860
I was reading like this kind of like this.

373
00:43:53,210 --> 00:43:56,180
Like this idea of like hijacking of people's struggles.

374
00:43:56,180 --> 00:44:02,900
Finally, it's kind of not recognizing that, like, the people who are most vulnerable situations aren't really brought to the table.

375
00:44:03,140 --> 00:44:11,240
They're not really able to kind of it's like discuss like what they've been through or even suggest like solutions.

376
00:44:11,240 --> 00:44:16,220
It's almost as if, like the people that are able to suggest those solutions are people who have an experience.

377
00:44:16,580 --> 00:44:20,810
Right. And so I think that in itself is a privilege that people don't really recognize,

378
00:44:21,200 --> 00:44:29,340
is that they have that ability to only see the issue from a but I'm going to take this right way.

379
00:44:29,720 --> 00:44:32,930
So yeah, yeah. No, that's another point.

380
00:44:32,930 --> 00:44:37,009
And I think that, you know, what you talked about,

381
00:44:37,010 --> 00:44:44,989
about bringing people to the table who are most impacted is the thing that in in all the public health work that I do,

382
00:44:44,990 --> 00:44:52,010
both practice and research that is at the center. And I think that for all of you that needs to be at the center, because you're right.

383
00:44:52,010 --> 00:45:00,229
As you know, as even as public health students, like you said, you've got privilege as a public health professional working in different spaces.

384
00:45:00,230 --> 00:45:04,910
You have a [INAUDIBLE] ton of privilege and you can you know,

385
00:45:04,910 --> 00:45:11,330
you can challenge the status quo and demand that community members are brought to the table.

386
00:45:11,780 --> 00:45:16,550
Um, you know, it can be hard sometimes, especially if you feel like you don't have as much power,

387
00:45:17,210 --> 00:45:21,890
but you would be surprised sometimes how people might respond to that.

388
00:45:22,340 --> 00:45:28,720
Um, you know, I think my training in clinical psych actually has helped me out a lot because I,

389
00:45:28,760 --> 00:45:32,690
you know, I'm always thinking about, um, how people think and how they're doing things.

390
00:45:32,690 --> 00:45:43,159
And I found really innovative ways of making people feel guilty and presenting my plan and strategy in such a way that you can't say no,

391
00:45:43,160 --> 00:45:47,690
that if you do, it's going to sound really sexist, homophobic, racist, all those things.

392
00:45:48,140 --> 00:45:52,720
So this is a place where I would say use manipulation to really think about it.

393
00:45:52,730 --> 00:45:57,350
Manipulation is just changing things to have a different outcome, right?

394
00:45:57,950 --> 00:46:01,070
So you're just changing things to have a better outcome.

395
00:46:01,430 --> 00:46:06,350
So, you know, asking people, well, why aren't any people from Flint at the table?

396
00:46:07,040 --> 00:46:08,750
You know, sometimes it's really as simple as.

397
00:46:08,840 --> 00:46:15,620
Asking those really targeted questions because what some are going to say, oh, no, we don't want those people here.

398
00:46:16,400 --> 00:46:23,750
Right. So you have to think about how can you when you have less power and you can't just say, I demand that people from Flint are at this table,

399
00:46:24,170 --> 00:46:35,270
you can ask those questions, which will then that's a way that you can have hidden power and using the privilege that you do have to be in that space.

400
00:46:35,270 --> 00:46:42,890
And I'm really glad you said that, Akeelah, because that's really important to push people into bringing people to the table.

401
00:46:43,190 --> 00:46:47,210
Now, sometimes they may say things like, Oh, well, that's not really feasible, or things like that.

402
00:46:47,450 --> 00:46:50,840
And I've been in situations where they said ice and I said, Well, I'll,

403
00:46:50,960 --> 00:46:57,140
I'll step down from the committee and you can take the money or resources you were going to give me and give to the community.

404
00:46:58,730 --> 00:47:07,639
And it's funny how quickly people find new pots of money when you do have power or privilege.

405
00:47:07,640 --> 00:47:11,450
And then you, you know, you offer someone you're the one doing all the work.

406
00:47:12,230 --> 00:47:16,639
When you offered to step away. Yeah. So I think that's that's a really great point.

407
00:47:16,640 --> 00:47:21,130
And I think that too, you know, I spent a lot of time on privilege and power, obviously, on this.

408
00:47:21,140 --> 00:47:27,470
But I think that as you go out in the world and do whatever it is you're going to do, even if you're not in public health,

409
00:47:28,070 --> 00:47:33,040
that especially for people who do hold more privilege and all of you have some degree of privilege,

410
00:47:33,080 --> 00:47:43,280
you wouldn't be sitting in these seats, but really doing some good, deep, introspective work about finding out what privilege you do have.

411
00:47:44,120 --> 00:47:52,130
Because, again, the more privilege you have, oftentimes, the less you're aware of that privilege.

412
00:47:53,120 --> 00:48:04,309
And really, again, thank you, intersectionality. So thinking across all aspects of your existence and seeing and how you can use that privilege,

413
00:48:04,310 --> 00:48:08,270
how you can use that power to try to do something positive.

414
00:48:10,130 --> 00:48:16,220
And again, I think you've got to be strategic. You know, you can you can kind of come in with blinders like, oh,

415
00:48:16,220 --> 00:48:21,350
I'm going to do good for the world and everyone's going to want to help people and blah, blah, blah, [INAUDIBLE].

416
00:48:22,580 --> 00:48:30,500
There's a lot of egotistical people who are doing this because like you were saying as mean that they they just want to be the voice,

417
00:48:30,500 --> 00:48:35,810
they want to be the person to say, Oh, I saw the, you know, x, y, z crisis.

418
00:48:36,020 --> 00:48:41,470
No, you didn't. There's a whole lot of people that it takes to do that oppression.

419
00:48:42,470 --> 00:48:48,700
We talked a lot about oppression, but just to kind of give a little more nuanced discussion about it.

420
00:48:51,380 --> 00:48:56,630
When we talk about a perfect oppression and privilege, some people talk about both external and internal.

421
00:48:57,170 --> 00:49:03,620
So external oppression would be things like rules, policy believes, biases,

422
00:49:03,620 --> 00:49:09,350
other things like that that keep people with certain characteristics out of the mainstream.

423
00:49:09,800 --> 00:49:14,420
So that's where outside forces and those forces can be structural.

424
00:49:14,420 --> 00:49:20,150
Those forces could be cultural, keep other people out.

425
00:49:20,360 --> 00:49:26,870
And so there's the people who have the advantages and people who don't have the advantages that also external privilege.

426
00:49:26,870 --> 00:49:29,750
So this is the opposite of external oppression,

427
00:49:30,260 --> 00:49:36,589
where the mainstream culture and rules provide advantages to a group of people based on some common characteristics.

428
00:49:36,590 --> 00:49:40,669
And that's why when we talked before, when we first started talking about privilege,

429
00:49:40,670 --> 00:49:46,930
some people talked about how privilege is something that society gives you that you don't ask for or seek out.

430
00:49:46,940 --> 00:49:51,889
It's just given to you. That's the kind of external privilege as we've talked about.

431
00:49:51,890 --> 00:50:01,550
You can actually there are some kinds of privilege that can be earned, like education, economic privilege, other things like that.

432
00:50:01,970 --> 00:50:05,360
But a lot of them are things that are just given.

433
00:50:05,690 --> 00:50:14,630
And then there's the internalized process too. And now these internalized processes are so much harder because it's not always easy to identify.

434
00:50:15,560 --> 00:50:25,520
And this is where in your public health work, you know, it's so important to do formative work before you're doing interventions or,

435
00:50:25,790 --> 00:50:30,950
you know, creating public health programs and to really find out where people are.

436
00:50:31,370 --> 00:50:41,630
Because if you just start out assuming that people have a certain level of internalized oppression or lack thereof,

437
00:50:42,050 --> 00:50:45,110
you may be developing a really amazing program,

438
00:50:45,530 --> 00:50:52,910
but people have been through so much and are bombarded by so many messages that they may not access your intervention.

439
00:50:53,800 --> 00:50:56,660
Right. So it's it's really important. And again, it's hard.

440
00:50:56,930 --> 00:51:00,500
I mean, there's different scales out there for internalized oppression and things like that.

441
00:51:00,890 --> 00:51:08,390
But really it's really helpful to do community forums, community townhalls, focus groups.

442
00:51:08,680 --> 00:51:10,170
Things like that to get their opinions.

443
00:51:10,180 --> 00:51:16,749
So when we're talking about internalized, internalized oppression, it's where people internalize those negative messages.

444
00:51:16,750 --> 00:51:25,120
So, you know, when I was talking earlier about being a young gay man in Kenya, you know,

445
00:51:25,150 --> 00:51:29,200
the individual I was talking about had internalized that message that if you don't get married.

446
00:51:29,590 --> 00:51:33,879
And this was like very, very strong, you know, you're not worth anything.

447
00:51:33,880 --> 00:51:39,640
You're kicked out all those other kinds of things. Who can think of ways in which.

448
00:51:41,660 --> 00:51:52,040
Different groups. It could be a group you belong to or not might internalize oppressive messages and then that lead to negative health outcomes.

449
00:51:53,210 --> 00:52:00,410
So there's the internalization of a negative message and then that internalization of a negative message leading to a negative outcome.

450
00:52:00,440 --> 00:52:00,670
Yeah,

451
00:52:01,620 --> 00:52:11,660
I think about like the pressure put on women who are becoming mothers and how that relates to postpartum depression and like the mom's guilt of like,

452
00:52:11,930 --> 00:52:17,080
Oh, I don't love my kid enough, I'm not doing a good job. I should be spending more time on the family about working.

453
00:52:17,090 --> 00:52:21,620
I think that can really make postpartum depression anxiety a lot worse.

454
00:52:22,010 --> 00:52:26,690
That's a great example. Yeah. Yeah. You said colourism.

455
00:52:26,690 --> 00:52:32,190
I think within a lot of different communities, which can lead to like negative health outcomes,

456
00:52:32,190 --> 00:52:37,220
like people using like, you know, like creams or like chemicals on their skin, which are really, really harmful.

457
00:52:37,910 --> 00:52:41,660
And then also just like the negative mental health impacts of colourism too,

458
00:52:41,930 --> 00:52:47,750
and then people within their communities weaponizing it against other members in their own right.

459
00:52:48,040 --> 00:52:55,009
Yeah. Excellent example. Yeah. And yeah, I think Colourism is something I think we need to talk more about and you know, in public health too.

460
00:52:55,010 --> 00:53:01,549
And it, you know, it happens across countries, across cultures, happens a lot, you know, here.

461
00:53:01,550 --> 00:53:03,110
And, you know, you raise a really good point.

462
00:53:03,200 --> 00:53:12,679
Like, there are just like the physical damages to the skin and things like that, but then the mental health aspects as well.

463
00:53:12,680 --> 00:53:15,910
So it's really kind of a dual, you know, kind of negative. Yeah.

464
00:53:17,000 --> 00:53:23,480
The first thing I thought of was like how certain body types will go like and then out of style kind of,

465
00:53:24,830 --> 00:53:29,959
which really has a negative impact on people's eating habits.

466
00:53:29,960 --> 00:53:37,430
And then like mental health, which can lead to like weight cycling or like really unhealthy weight loss or, you know, like eating disorders.

467
00:53:37,470 --> 00:53:39,620
Yeah. Yeah. That's when, you know,

468
00:53:39,620 --> 00:53:48,110
I think a fair amount of evidence shows with different social media platforms that have perpetuated those unhealthy body image issues.

469
00:53:48,950 --> 00:53:54,559
I did see like 5 minutes of Daytime Emmys.

470
00:53:54,560 --> 00:54:02,480
I think last night I, I saw Lizzo sitting in her award and for a reality show for big girls.

471
00:54:02,960 --> 00:54:09,110
Um, and it was, it was really cool because, like, five years ago, we would never see that stuff.

472
00:54:09,410 --> 00:54:17,180
Never, never, never, never. And she's breaking those boundaries, you know, and saying, no, you don't have to be this size.

473
00:54:17,180 --> 00:54:23,989
You don't have to look at this. And I think just in general, hopefully it's changing some.

474
00:54:23,990 --> 00:54:34,700
I mean, we are seeing more diversity in body image, in popular spaces and even in like clothes and stuff like that.

475
00:54:34,700 --> 00:54:38,779
There's a lot more. I remember I walked in the target.

476
00:54:38,780 --> 00:54:46,110
I hadn't been in a store in so long and it was really cool to see like posters are the, you know,

477
00:54:46,220 --> 00:54:52,730
different images on billboards and stuff and people were like all different shapes and sizes and colors and it was just,

478
00:54:52,790 --> 00:54:57,170
you know, different gender expressions. It was really cool to see that change.

479
00:54:57,950 --> 00:55:04,099
Yeah, I also think up with what we're talking about, it's an actual question.

480
00:55:04,100 --> 00:55:12,290
I think that there's also this issue with assuming that one is oppressed people like a muslim woman, for example.

481
00:55:12,680 --> 00:55:19,610
Oh, like she's oppressed because she expresses like so and so or she's, she's like just, you know, Muslim in general.

482
00:55:19,610 --> 00:55:27,580
So, like, this assumption has. That you have this privilege over somebody else, including that person.

483
00:55:29,980 --> 00:55:38,799
Yeah, that's interesting. I'm not sure about her, but I mean, who's was talking about the being careful not to make assumptions that certain people,

484
00:55:38,800 --> 00:55:45,550
because of their identities, are oppressed. So the example of Muslim women and people assuming, oh, you know,

485
00:55:45,550 --> 00:55:51,850
you're oppressed because of X, Y or Z, and that is a way for people to hold power over.

486
00:55:51,940 --> 00:55:59,250
You know, if they if you're put a muslim woman in the box of like, oh, these poor, oppressed women, we have to help them follow the law.

487
00:55:59,260 --> 00:56:05,920
I think that's a really great point to is not making assumptions about internalized oppression to, you know,

488
00:56:06,670 --> 00:56:14,260
just because someone is from a political identity group that you may perceive as being oppressed, they may not.

489
00:56:14,930 --> 00:56:15,940
Yeah, that's a really good point.

490
00:56:16,510 --> 00:56:27,340
One more example, and that is that male identified bodies are not as talkative in class and now you're scarcer in numbers.

491
00:56:27,580 --> 00:56:32,640
Yes. Thank you, Joseph, for being the brave one to speak on.

492
00:56:33,830 --> 00:56:36,950
In low income communities, especially in rural areas.

493
00:56:38,690 --> 00:56:45,200
A lot of times there's these ideas of like what it is to be masculine and that you have to provide for your family.

494
00:56:45,560 --> 00:56:48,620
And in a lot of these areas, jobs have kind of been stripped out of.

495
00:56:50,030 --> 00:56:57,230
It leads a lot of a lot of men, especially to turnover to opioids and other substance abuse issues.

496
00:56:57,600 --> 00:56:59,540
Yeah, that's a really great example.

497
00:56:59,540 --> 00:57:08,270
And I think, you know, we focus so much I think a lot at least seemed like in speech focused on on urban populations.

498
00:57:09,080 --> 00:57:12,979
But we don't often think about like rule situations. And yeah, you're definitely right.

499
00:57:12,980 --> 00:57:21,510
I mean, there's a lot of. You know, it's kind of that combination of there's all these amount of masculinity beliefs and rural communities about,

500
00:57:21,540 --> 00:57:28,540
you know, what it means to be a man, what it should be. And then when that stripped away, then where do you turn?

501
00:57:28,590 --> 00:57:40,830
What do you do? And it's interesting because to know I use a lot of examples, but when the when the British came in and colonized Kenya,

502
00:57:41,250 --> 00:57:52,170
they were actually very systematic about taking the role of men in power and stripping them of their masculinity and of their roles.

503
00:57:52,590 --> 00:57:58,209
And then that led to substance use, which was introduced by the Europeans and all these other things.

504
00:57:58,210 --> 00:58:08,010
So it's kind of scary how systematic there was. So that whole concept of men being in charge around man hegemonic masculinity and that

505
00:58:08,010 --> 00:58:14,010
becomes are all identity and then taking away their potential expressions of that,

506
00:58:14,370 --> 00:58:17,429
that leading to mental health challenges and leading substances. Yeah.

507
00:58:17,430 --> 00:58:26,669
What are you going to say? Something to say about anxiety and how a lot of times in the black community is associated with black people being

508
00:58:26,670 --> 00:58:35,340
uneducated and in turn someone who uses a they might not really feel comfortable entering certain academic settings.

509
00:58:36,210 --> 00:58:40,440
They're afraid of like, what about you?

510
00:58:41,850 --> 00:58:45,450
And would you mind sharing with their want to make sure one of those which is African-American

511
00:58:45,450 --> 00:58:52,570
vernacular English the way we talk express ourselves and it goes back to the history and slavery.

512
00:58:54,360 --> 00:59:00,659
Yeah. No, that's a great example. And even there was this phase in history where it was called Ebonics, you know,

513
00:59:00,660 --> 00:59:05,210
I mean, there's a long history of how it's been conceptualized and academic is.

514
00:59:05,880 --> 00:59:10,220
And I think that's a really great example. All right.

515
00:59:10,640 --> 00:59:13,970
Anything else? Any other? Those are really excellent examples.

516
00:59:15,950 --> 00:59:21,020
Let me see. Yeah. So white privilege. I want to follow a little bit about this.

517
00:59:22,340 --> 00:59:27,350
And this is actually something from I like to look at other sources besides just like typical,

518
00:59:27,350 --> 00:59:31,220
you know, traditional, boring, nerdy public health stuff.

519
00:59:31,730 --> 00:59:39,650
This is from everyday feminism, which there's some really great stuff online and a lot of the feminist blogs and feminist circles.

520
00:59:40,040 --> 00:59:45,260
So this is one about white privilege. So you know what it means to have white privilege.

521
00:59:45,310 --> 00:59:51,080
I have the privilege of having a positive relationship with the police generally. I have the privilege of being favored by school authorities.

522
00:59:51,320 --> 00:59:53,510
I have the privilege of attending segregated schools,

523
00:59:53,510 --> 01:00:00,950
of affluence as a prone to worry about my race and school privilege of buying children's books that are really wrong, that represent my race.

524
01:00:01,850 --> 01:00:03,079
There was a soaking in media,

525
01:00:03,080 --> 01:00:11,180
blatantly biased toward my race privilege of escaping violent stereotypes associated with my race privilege and playing the colorblind card,

526
01:00:11,480 --> 01:00:17,120
wiping the slate clean of centuries of racism privilege of being as insulated from the daily

527
01:00:17,120 --> 01:00:22,760
toll of racism and the privilege of living ignorant of the dire state of racism today.

528
01:00:22,880 --> 01:00:27,500
And I find the theme, unfortunately, very relevant, I think, today.

529
01:00:27,710 --> 01:00:34,280
But again, for people to think about how pervasive that is,

530
01:00:34,880 --> 01:00:39,470
how many people have relative Robin D'Angelo's work on white fragility, does anyone read any of this?

531
01:00:40,000 --> 01:00:43,100
You know, I read it for all. You read the book. Okay, cool.

532
01:00:43,430 --> 01:00:47,870
Yeah. So, I mean, and it's interesting because some of her works come under attack, too.

533
01:00:49,820 --> 01:00:54,470
You know, I don't I don't look at things as black and white. You know, again, I live in the gray.

534
01:00:54,710 --> 01:01:00,020
So there are some good things that you can pull from her work.

535
01:01:00,500 --> 01:01:06,680
But there are some elements of white savior ism in there.

536
01:01:07,040 --> 01:01:13,830
But again, I think it's important to pull what you can and not throw the baby out with the bathwater.

537
01:01:13,910 --> 01:01:18,200
That's horrible phrase again and again. No critical line. Why would you throw a baby out?

538
01:01:18,650 --> 01:01:22,219
Oh, that's so sweet. You know.

539
01:01:22,220 --> 01:01:27,390
Exactly. That's right. And you don't throw a baby away, but it's kind of like in space.

540
01:01:27,530 --> 01:01:31,760
You don't need to tell me to breathe. I'm going to do that. So you don't need to tell me not to throw baby away.

541
01:01:32,880 --> 01:01:40,940
So anyway, so Robin D'Angelo and there's a I'm not going to go to this link, but this is an interesting interview with her.

542
01:01:42,830 --> 01:01:48,900
So she said, I think sort of like in the corporate world or out of nowhere, horrible story.

543
01:01:48,920 --> 01:01:55,520
Anyway, she's a white woman and writes about kind of this concept of white fragility.

544
01:01:57,620 --> 01:01:59,390
And so she talks about for most people.

545
01:02:00,070 --> 01:02:07,010
And again, I think that a lot of folks in this room would not be as much the target audience of who she's thinking about.

546
01:02:07,010 --> 01:02:08,060
But most people,

547
01:02:08,960 --> 01:02:22,370
most white folks do move through the world being totally insulated from any conversations of race and don't even know what race based stress is now.

548
01:02:22,400 --> 01:02:23,240
A lot of white folks, you know,

549
01:02:23,240 --> 01:02:33,080
their whole life where they're really never interacting with a person of color other than maybe through different temporary settings.

550
01:02:33,440 --> 01:02:43,770
And so what she talks about is that by doing this, there's this expectation of comfort.

551
01:02:43,790 --> 01:02:47,960
So since I'm white and I don't have to deal with this, I'm comfortable with that.

552
01:02:48,110 --> 01:03:01,610
So everything's cool, right? So that's a privilege. And also, it leads to as she talks about the inability to deal with racial racial stress.

553
01:03:01,970 --> 01:03:04,550
And then that leads to that, what she calls white fragility.

554
01:03:04,880 --> 01:03:13,910
And so she talks about white fragility to this concept of when any bit of racial tension occurs,

555
01:03:14,330 --> 01:03:22,600
that that white people become very agitated and become defensive.

556
01:03:22,610 --> 01:03:31,930
And so then all the focus goes on them and how they're feeling and takes away the true focus on whatever kind of racial incident.

557
01:03:32,240 --> 01:03:40,819
Things like that. And so they can show a different way. So maybe anger, maybe frustration, maybe guilt, no other things like that.

558
01:03:40,820 --> 01:03:49,970
But it's it's really people's reaction and response to being confronted with racial inequality or racism, things like that.

559
01:03:50,330 --> 01:03:58,370
I mean, during the, you know, the Trump administration and how many times, you know, he said, I'm not racist.

560
01:03:59,030 --> 01:04:06,470
That's one of the most recent statements, I think, or one of the best indicators of whether or not I mean, he has a ton of white fragility.

561
01:04:07,220 --> 01:04:14,230
He's got lots of other psychologic. Well, the only way I can say that because I know.

562
01:04:16,420 --> 01:04:20,950
But don't quote me on Iraq or anything.

563
01:04:20,950 --> 01:04:31,800
But. But with, you know, white fragility, it is I mean, I think, you know, some of the actually talks about I think there is some truth in this.

564
01:04:31,810 --> 01:04:37,000
I think that for a lot of white folks who have never dealt with these issues, you know,

565
01:04:37,030 --> 01:04:46,149
I have rural white relatives that I don't really talk too much because their viewpoints,

566
01:04:46,150 --> 01:04:51,760
their perspectives are from another planet compared to, you know, where where I'm from.

567
01:04:51,970 --> 01:05:00,130
And I think that she is accurate, too, that for some people they make it all about them.

568
01:05:01,600 --> 01:05:11,559
And so then it's almost like pulling the person or the people of color to then focus on that person's anxiety.

569
01:05:11,560 --> 01:05:17,080
And depending on the space to, you know, if it's a space where everyone is trying to be nice to everyone,

570
01:05:17,290 --> 01:05:21,850
then everyone's trying to comfort the white person about making a statement.

571
01:05:22,000 --> 01:05:27,480
When the person who lives this [INAUDIBLE] every day is sitting there like, what the hell's going on?

572
01:05:27,490 --> 01:05:34,059
I mean, you know, you just started crying because you never thought about the fact that your children

573
01:05:34,060 --> 01:05:39,010
don't have to be looking out for the police when they walk home from school.

574
01:05:39,280 --> 01:05:45,460
And that made you cry. But what's it like for the person who does everything, Mother?

575
01:05:45,640 --> 01:05:49,360
So what do you think about white fragility? That's a really broad question.

576
01:05:50,740 --> 01:05:56,760
I want to keep it broad. Yeah.

577
01:05:57,000 --> 01:05:59,520
And then we're like, you know, whatever.

578
01:05:59,520 --> 01:06:10,380
But we're like in high school sometimes almost getting the sentence defensive on behalf of my like friends, if they felt like, oh, I don't know,

579
01:06:10,440 --> 01:06:19,049
like they didn't do anything wrong or they had, I think, like, I believe, like people feel the way they feel like you can't control that.

580
01:06:19,050 --> 01:06:26,480
But I remember like, oh, like just because, like they're not experiencing racism doesn't mean that,

581
01:06:26,740 --> 01:06:31,550
you know, we can call them out for and it was interesting that that was my mindset at the time.

582
01:06:32,490 --> 01:06:38,940
And even like if they maybe made a slightly racist joke, like Asians be like, oh, it's okay.

583
01:06:38,940 --> 01:06:45,090
Like it's not a big deal. You kind of brushing it off and not really realizing it probably wasn't okay.

584
01:06:45,990 --> 01:06:52,650
So yeah, and I think that's a developmental process too. I think as you become more aware and some people may continue to do that.

585
01:06:52,740 --> 01:06:57,370
Right. What about other things for sure that you think about?

586
01:06:57,390 --> 01:06:59,580
Oh, I'm sorry. I was just going to say,

587
01:06:59,580 --> 01:07:07,210
like more and more people are becoming aware of it because it's being documented now with social media things like videos, white.

588
01:07:08,510 --> 01:07:16,340
Um, and it's just interesting, you know, like the time came over the years to like, yeah, it's just interesting.

589
01:07:16,650 --> 01:07:23,520
I feel like a good thing because finally, like it's being shown and recorded and like besides, you know,

590
01:07:23,520 --> 01:07:29,820
back then how you can only say it to other people like what you write, but there's no, like, proof.

591
01:07:30,990 --> 01:07:38,910
Yeah, I think that's a really good point. Yeah. Yeah, it's like it makes me think, like, of how dangerous it could be.

592
01:07:39,480 --> 01:07:46,170
So, like, I remember one video. This woman is white woman was, like, screaming and just, like, throwing the whole thing,

593
01:07:46,410 --> 01:07:49,010
you know, in the middle of, like, Victoria's Secret or something.

594
01:07:49,590 --> 01:07:56,100
A black woman, she was recording her just like, you know, saying, like, she didn't do anything and she didn't know why.

595
01:07:56,100 --> 01:08:03,240
One was making it seem like this lady just, like, attacked her something, like, so horribly wrong.

596
01:08:04,260 --> 01:08:05,969
But, like, you know, nothing happened.

597
01:08:05,970 --> 01:08:13,010
Like, it was the white woman spot, but the people that were, like, watching it were telling the black lady's like, leave her alone, right?

598
01:08:13,070 --> 01:08:21,240
She wasn't doing anything. Yeah, there's a assumption a lot of times because of racism that she was a perpetrator.

599
01:08:21,480 --> 01:08:23,790
And I'm not someone who maybe experienced it.

600
01:08:23,910 --> 01:08:29,850
And I think you raised your point about like with social media and also with cameras and everyone's phone.

601
01:08:30,390 --> 01:08:36,060
You know, we now have a lens into a lot of things that we never did before.

602
01:08:36,420 --> 01:08:40,450
You know, if we look at like police brutality, if we look at acts of racism,

603
01:08:40,830 --> 01:08:46,770
you know, other acts of transphobia, heterosexism, we may have heard stories.

604
01:08:47,040 --> 01:08:50,430
And often those are discounted by Minoritized people.

605
01:08:50,790 --> 01:08:55,140
So very oh, that says you're just overreacting. But now we can actually see the video evidence.

606
01:08:55,170 --> 01:09:03,270
Yeah, I was going to say, I think I've always thought of white fragility as being like you guys were saying.

607
01:09:03,840 --> 01:09:10,600
But now that I'm seeing like emotions, like fear and behavior such as like silence or leaving the situation,

608
01:09:11,340 --> 01:09:18,900
I think it's like something that a lot more people are guilty of than they actually realize.

609
01:09:19,410 --> 01:09:22,800
Because now that I'm like seeing that up there, I'm like, I've definitely done that.

610
01:09:22,920 --> 01:09:26,940
And like, I'm not acting like, okay. And I'm like, you guys were saying, right?

611
01:09:28,530 --> 01:09:33,390
So it just makes me realize that, like, white fragility can be like a whole spectrum, right?

612
01:09:34,530 --> 01:09:36,010
Yeah. Yeah. Thanks for sharing that.

613
01:09:36,050 --> 01:09:44,340
And I think that is a really good point, is that we often see the videotapes and like the extremes, but there's also more subtle ways,

614
01:09:44,670 --> 01:09:54,960
you know, and sometimes in people's silence and in people's not showing up, that can send a stronger message than the screaming, you know.

615
01:09:56,310 --> 01:09:59,490
Yeah. So I think it's good for us to think about the range of ways.

616
01:09:59,490 --> 01:10:07,270
So you for about anyone else. I will spend some time thinking about life fragility.

617
01:10:08,230 --> 01:10:12,920
We're going to end with liberation. Did you get all that right?

618
01:10:13,210 --> 01:10:18,700
So we're going to liberate you and we'll be talking about this more with Oprah.

619
01:10:19,240 --> 01:10:22,930
But liberation is the opposite of oppression.

620
01:10:23,800 --> 01:10:28,360
It's where people gain power, where people gain their freedom, where they gain their agency.

621
01:10:30,610 --> 01:10:38,769
You know, there's an objective change in how society works, and that is objective change in how people feel so and how they experience the world.

622
01:10:38,770 --> 01:10:43,780
So with true liberation, it's not just I'm liberated in this space, in this moment,

623
01:10:44,170 --> 01:10:54,550
but I'm changing structural barriers so that I can continue that because there can be like temporary liberation or momentary liberation,

624
01:10:54,910 --> 01:10:58,330
which can give you a, you know, a little like for a moment.

625
01:10:58,780 --> 01:11:03,280
But if it's not sustainable, then it's not really true liberation.

626
01:11:04,420 --> 01:11:12,340
And so, you know, if we get if we graduate one black trans woman from, you know,

627
01:11:12,340 --> 01:11:16,419
from this program with a master's degree, we can say, yeah, we did that,

628
01:11:16,420 --> 01:11:22,389
but then how are we going to get more black trans women or Asian trans men or,

629
01:11:22,390 --> 01:11:28,840
you know, the whole other group of people with diverse, intersectional identities and.

630
01:11:30,230 --> 01:11:34,280
We'll be talking about this more when we talk about prayer.

631
01:11:34,280 --> 01:11:40,729
But I do want to point out this quote from him In order for the oppressed to be able to wage the struggle for their liberation,

632
01:11:40,730 --> 01:11:49,280
they must perceive the reality of oppression, not as a closed world from which there is no exit, but as a limiting situation which they can transform.

633
01:11:49,580 --> 01:11:52,610
So people have to believe that things can change.

634
01:11:52,880 --> 01:11:57,320
And again, that's how oppression works, is people believe it's never going to change.

635
01:11:57,740 --> 01:12:02,450
You know, I was born a woman, so I just have to deal with this.

636
01:12:02,840 --> 01:12:08,150
I was born in a Puerto Rican, so I just have to deal with this.

637
01:12:08,390 --> 01:12:12,980
So that's part of the process. And when we talk more about this prayer, I mean, first of some things, too,

638
01:12:12,980 --> 01:12:20,930
about the role of the oppressor and liberation and how liberation really needs to come from the oppressed group.

639
01:12:21,350 --> 01:12:24,530
So we will talk some more about that.

640
01:12:27,470 --> 01:12:35,150
Let me see. I get like the second point that true liberation does not only remove our oppressors from power,

641
01:12:35,150 --> 01:12:37,940
but also great society in which the role of the oppressor doesn't exist.

642
01:12:37,950 --> 01:12:42,920
So that's the ultimate is like, yeah, we can change the structures for our bed,

643
01:12:43,250 --> 01:12:50,950
but if we can change the structure so that there is no role, there's no need for the oppressor anymore, that's even more ideal.

644
01:12:50,960 --> 01:12:58,490
So if you look at colonization and the ways in which European countries colonized so many places.

645
01:12:59,870 --> 01:13:08,570
True liberation takes a lot more than just removing the, you know, the oppressor from that country.

646
01:13:08,720 --> 01:13:19,570
It takes really a cleansing of the oppressor and a reinvigoration of the indigenous culture.

647
01:13:19,580 --> 01:13:21,560
So it's a lot more complicated.

648
01:13:23,510 --> 01:13:29,020
In this last one, people commit themselves to human liberation to constantly reflect on their preexisting beliefs and biases.

649
01:13:29,030 --> 01:13:35,840
And again, that's why I really want you to engage in so much reflection and introspection,

650
01:13:36,110 --> 01:13:43,730
because in order to be part of liberation, you've got to do a lot of work up here before you can do work out here.

651
01:13:44,420 --> 01:13:47,510
And so I will see you.

652
01:13:47,780 --> 01:13:51,319
One more thing. I will not be here on Thursday.

653
01:13:51,320 --> 01:14:02,600
I have a family emergency. I'm flying out in about a couple hours, but I feel will be here and we will have a critical reflection circle.

654
01:14:02,600 --> 01:14:10,630
So we still have class. Everything will be going on. I just don't deserve it. I have a good day here.

655
01:14:11,310 --> 01:14:15,060
Here's happy to say.
