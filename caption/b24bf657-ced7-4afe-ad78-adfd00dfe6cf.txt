00:00:00,219 --> 00:00:04,904
Today, we're going to practice

2
00:00:04,904 --> 00:00:09,587
how to reflect very change talk,

3
00:00:09,587 --> 00:00:16,113
how to not get overwhelmed with negativity and

4
00:00:16,113 --> 00:00:21,480
to pick up these particles of change.

5
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:24,494
One of the ways we like to think about training folks and

6
00:00:24,494 --> 00:00:27,521
me is that we're installing a filter into your brain.

7
00:00:27,521 --> 00:00:30,172
Currently, little tiny particles of change talk.

8
00:00:30,172 --> 00:00:33,692
Little fragments of change talk are possibly passing through and

9
00:00:33,692 --> 00:00:35,297
you're not capturing them.

10
00:00:35,297 --> 00:00:40,024
By installing this filter, we're hoping you're now going to

11
00:00:40,024 --> 00:00:43,602
capture even the smallest hint of change talk.

12
00:00:43,602 --> 00:00:46,495
So let's go ahead and see if we can find the very change talk.

13
00:00:46,495 --> 00:00:49,342
Let's see if we can find these little nuggets and

14
00:00:49,342 --> 00:00:52,196
hopefully your filter will start to catch them.

15
00:00:52,196 --> 00:00:54,279
So let's start with this client statement.

16
00:00:54,279 --> 00:01:07,543
Take a look.

17
00:01:07,543 --> 00:01:08,447
So first of all,

18
00:01:08,447 --> 00:01:12,330
let's see if we all agree what are the little fragments of change talk?

19
00:01:12,330 --> 00:01:13,848
Well, that's all the bold text here.

20
00:01:13,848 --> 00:01:18,045
They're fragments of change talk particles.

21
00:01:18,045 --> 00:01:24,940
How would you reflect this back?

22
00:01:24,940 --> 00:01:26,986
Well, take a look.

23
00:01:26,986 --> 00:01:29,893
The top one is a double sided reflection.

24
00:01:29,893 --> 00:01:33,987
It handles both the resistance and the change talk at once.

25
00:01:33,987 --> 00:01:37,279
Although right now you don't feel you can handle working on your way.

26
00:01:37,279 --> 00:01:41,075
On the other hand, you're starting to feel the effects of your weight and you're

27
00:01:41,075 --> 00:01:44,666
thinking that maybe in a few months you might be able to do something about it.

28
00:01:44,666 --> 00:01:46,187
Now, making a more immediate.

29
00:01:46,187 --> 00:01:46,993
This is a trick.

30
00:01:46,993 --> 00:01:49,027
We'll use a couple of times today.

31
00:01:49,027 --> 00:01:51,623
Part of you would like to start working on your weight.

32
00:01:51,623 --> 00:01:54,614
So sort of pulling it from the future into the present.

33
00:01:54,614 --> 00:02:01,215
Notice here that tentative tone starting to maybe might part of you that's that

34
00:02:01,215 --> 00:02:08,221
very cautious under shooting tone we've talked about which helps avoid reactant.

35
00:02:08,221 --> 00:02:13,947
We don't want the person to feel we've overstated their readiness.

36
00:02:13,947 --> 00:02:16,847
Let's take a look at another client statement again,

37
00:02:16,847 --> 00:02:19,315
it's a mix of sustained talking change talk.

38
00:02:19,315 --> 00:02:21,649
We're going to reflect back both ends of it.

39
00:02:21,649 --> 00:02:37,687
Starting with the resistance of the negative and ending on the positive.

40
00:02:37,687 --> 00:02:39,003
So let's see again.

41
00:02:39,003 --> 00:02:47,454
Did your filter pick up the fragments of change talk?

42
00:02:47,454 --> 00:02:50,789
The boldest text is all changed talk.

43
00:02:50,789 --> 00:02:52,514
Again, it's muted.

44
00:02:52,514 --> 00:02:57,126
It's not necessarily the strongest intensity,

45
00:02:57,126 --> 00:03:00,427
but it is change talk nonetheless.

46
00:03:00,427 --> 00:03:04,340
So now let's build a reflection that captures both

47
00:03:04,340 --> 00:03:08,804
the resistance part of the statement and the change talk.

48
00:03:08,804 --> 00:03:12,800
Although it's really stressful raising three kids and working two jobs and

49
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:15,868
your wife doesn't want you to be out of the house anymore.

50
00:03:15,868 --> 00:03:19,383
Part of you would really like to exercise again.

51
00:03:19,383 --> 00:03:22,275
You know what might help with your weight in your blood sugar and

52
00:03:22,275 --> 00:03:23,483
in particularly one rig.

53
00:03:23,483 --> 00:03:27,216
Can I ever recapture that intensity I felt when I used to play hockey.

54
00:03:27,216 --> 00:03:31,500
Is there something out there like that for me?

55
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:34,274
Let's take a look at another case.

56
00:03:34,274 --> 00:03:47,084
Please take a minute to read it.

57
00:03:47,084 --> 00:03:48,659
What could you reflect here?

58
00:03:48,659 --> 00:03:51,292
Go ahead and write one down or put it in your head and

59
00:03:51,292 --> 00:03:59,038
let's see what we would come up with.

60
00:03:59,038 --> 00:04:01,018
So first of all the change talk.

61
00:04:01,018 --> 00:04:02,109
Hopefully you've picked that up.

62
00:04:02,109 --> 00:04:04,663
We would all be better off if we are more active.

63
00:04:04,663 --> 00:04:10,584
We used to do it, we did it last summer and we enjoyed it.

64
00:04:10,584 --> 00:04:12,208
That's all changed talk.

65
00:04:12,208 --> 00:04:17,397
So the reflection for this case might be something along the lines of

66
00:04:17,397 --> 00:04:23,603
although things are really busy and you're not quite sure how you'll fit it in.

67
00:04:23,603 --> 00:04:26,451
You would like you and your family to be more active and

68
00:04:26,451 --> 00:04:30,692
in particular last summer when you went camping together, that was a wonderful

69
00:04:30,692 --> 00:04:36,866
experience that you would really love to replicate if possible.

70
00:04:36,866 --> 00:04:50,098
So let's take a look at this client statement.

71
00:04:50,098 --> 00:04:55,774
So this is a young parent who's trying to get her work

72
00:04:55,774 --> 00:05:01,456
done while at the same time occupying her daughter.

73
00:05:01,456 --> 00:05:10,556
What reflection did you come up with?

74
00:05:10,556 --> 00:05:15,342
So you need to get your work done and tv although a good babysitter is

75
00:05:15,342 --> 00:05:19,371
ultimately something you're not crazy about for her.

76
00:05:19,371 --> 00:05:22,323
You'd like to find something more productive for

77
00:05:22,323 --> 00:05:25,141
her that still allows you to get your work done.

78
00:05:25,141 --> 00:05:27,841
And it's hard financially because you can't afford a babysitter.

79
00:05:27,841 --> 00:05:31,245
So you have to come up with a way that will occupy your daughter without

80
00:05:31,245 --> 00:05:35,334
costing a lot of money.

81
00:05:35,334 --> 00:05:41,442
Now let's take a look at this adult smoker.

82
00:05:41,442 --> 00:05:49,635
What would you say back come up with your reflection.

83
00:05:49,635 --> 00:05:54,775
You might want to try something along the lines of you're starting

84
00:05:54,775 --> 00:05:59,840
to think that it might be time to do something about your smoking.

85
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:04,603
At 55, it reminds you what happened to your dad who you feel his heart

86
00:06:04,603 --> 00:06:06,804
attack was related to smoking.

87
00:06:06,804 --> 00:06:11,810
And the fact that you're coughing up all this crap in the morning is sort of

88
00:06:11,810 --> 00:06:17,164
a wake up call that maybe it's time to think about doing something about this.

89
00:06:17,164 --> 00:06:18,312
Now this is a tough one.

90
00:06:18,312 --> 00:06:19,765
Take a look at this.

91
00:06:19,765 --> 00:06:27,957
What the heck can we do with this one?

92
00:06:27,957 --> 00:06:31,510
This looks like it's almost devoid of any change talk.

93
00:06:31,510 --> 00:06:33,703
It's kicking the can forward.

94
00:06:33,703 --> 00:06:38,894
What could you do with it?

95
00:06:38,894 --> 00:06:44,407
So one of the tricks you can do here is although part of you doesn't

96
00:06:44,407 --> 00:06:49,418
want to have to deal with your drinking now, another part of

97
00:06:49,418 --> 00:06:55,751
you feels there's something a little out of control about your drinking.

98
00:06:55,751 --> 00:07:06,643
Take a look at this one.

99
00:07:06,643 --> 00:07:13,685
What would you say?

100
00:07:13,685 --> 00:07:18,314
So although part of you is scared to bring it up with him because he

101
00:07:18,314 --> 00:07:21,338
don't want him to feel you distrust him.

102
00:07:21,338 --> 00:07:24,320
Another part of you wants to protect yourself by using condoms,

103
00:07:24,320 --> 00:07:27,813
particularly given the fact that he's already giving you one in the past.

104
00:07:27,813 --> 00:07:31,044
You're starting to think that maybe you have to be more assertive.

105
00:07:31,044 --> 00:07:35,326
You're starting to think that maybe you have to stand up for yourself more.

106
00:07:35,326 --> 00:07:42,401
But it's hard because you don't want to make him feel that you don't trust him.

107
00:07:42,401 --> 00:07:46,244
Today, we've practiced some change talk reflections.

108
00:07:46,244 --> 00:07:49,563
We've seen clients who were ambivalent about change or

109
00:07:49,563 --> 00:07:51,264
only have weak change talk.

110
00:07:51,264 --> 00:07:55,793
And we hope we've installed this filter that now picks up these little

111
00:07:55,793 --> 00:08:00,781
fragments of change talk, which you will reflect with that tentative tone to

112
00:08:00,781 --> 00:08:07,120
avoid reactant and to allow the person to continue moving towards change.
