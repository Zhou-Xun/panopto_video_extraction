1
00:00:01,395 --> 00:00:16,395
All right, so I will go ahead and get started and then I think there's some others registered, and then they can pop in at any time and get caught up so welcome to this poll everywhere session

2
00:00:16,395 --> 00:00:23,395
we're recording this and just a few zoom things before we begin.

3
00:00:23,395 --> 00:00:27,395
I have enabled live transcript for this session.

4
00:00:27,395 --> 00:00:41,395
And so, if that would be helpful for you to turn on, there is a live transcript button in your zoom, Toolbar, that you can turn that on into individually for yourselves.

5
00:00:41,395 --> 00:00:45,395
4 questions during this session. Please feel free to put them in the chat.

6
00:00:45,395 --> 00:00:51,395
I have my chat window open on my other screen and feel free to unmute your microphone.

7
00:00:51,395 --> 00:00:58,395
To interrupt and ask questions at any time. Just note that that will get captured on the recording

8
00:00:58,395 --> 00:01:06,395
So if you're okay with that i'm okay with that. Oh, i'm just gonna discourage the use of the raise hand function.

9
00:01:06,395 --> 00:01:10,395
I may have you use it later for a specific purpose.

10
00:01:10,395 --> 00:01:24,395
But that's that'll be really hard to see while i'm screen sharing with my fles and i'm gonna be sharing the recording and the slides out with you later along with any other resources that come

11
00:01:24,395 --> 00:01:29,395
to mind.

12
00:01:29,395 --> 00:01:40,395
So before we begin, we're going to be using poll everywhere for this session, hoping to model a little bit of that interaction, or at least show you how it works.

13
00:01:40,395 --> 00:01:52,395
So for this, you'll either need to open a browser tab on your computer or grab your mobile device and have that handy and go ahead and take a minute to type.

14
00:01:52,395 --> 00:01:59,395
In whole ev dot com i'm gonna do that here on my other screen.

15
00:01:59,395 --> 00:02:10,395
Just so I have that up whole ev dot com and then I'll give you the rest of the information when we get there.

16
00:02:10,395 --> 00:02:19,395
Get to that point so just so you're at the ready

17
00:02:19,395 --> 00:02:24,395
So a little bit about. pull everywhere, pull everywhere, is an audio response tool.

18
00:02:24,395 --> 00:02:33,395
For live interactive experiences that are going to give you immediate results.

19
00:02:33,395 --> 00:02:38,395
Now I will say Poll everywhere is not a University of Michigan-wide tool.

20
00:02:38,395 --> 00:02:41,395
This is specifically licensed by the School of Public Health.

21
00:02:41,395 --> 00:02:49,395
So when if you share this with other colleagues, just know that we can only add them to our account.

22
00:02:49,395 --> 00:03:01,395
If they're they have a school public health affiliation there is a free account for Poll everywhere that will allow you to get responses for up to 40 participants.

23
00:03:01,395 --> 00:03:11,395
And so that can work for several in use cases. the school public health license increases that to 2,000 responses.

24
00:03:11,395 --> 00:03:25,395
So, making sure we're fully covering any classes and then you know, as our faculty give talks and things like that, they can still incorporate that if any of you attended so the school of public health town halls

25
00:03:25,395 --> 00:03:38,395
over the summer. You may have noticed that, being incorporated a little bit as a sort of icebreaker, warm-up

26
00:03:38,395 --> 00:03:46,395
So we can use Poll everywhere to offer peoples and feedback. You know.

27
00:03:46,395 --> 00:03:52,395
What do you think about this? And these can be open, ended polls and feedback options?

28
00:03:52,395 --> 00:04:06,395
They can be multiple choice. if there's certain parameters. So let's try a poll at the top of my screen.

29
00:04:06,395 --> 00:04:20,395
You should be seeing that you can respond at polyv dot com slash, Joanna, e So if you're on the web page right now, and it's asking you for the what goes in after the slash.

30
00:04:20,395 --> 00:04:32,395
It's Joanna e

31
00:04:32,395 --> 00:04:51,395
And it may ask you to enter in your name and I believe I have set these to not require a name to allow anonymous results, so there will be an option to skip

32
00:04:51,395 --> 00:05:02,395
So this is an example that I saw in one class where students were presenting different case studies, and they were giving pro and con on a certain aspect of the case.

33
00:05:02,395 --> 00:05:26,395
Studies and agree or disagree on the cause. And so and the rest of the class would vote on who gave the most compelling case

34
00:05:26,395 --> 00:05:44,395
And so notice we can see these if you put back over to zoom. You'll be able to see these results coming in live

35
00:05:44,395 --> 00:05:56,395
Was everyone able to access. Is anyone running into issues accessing the poll page

36
00:05:56,395 --> 00:06:01,395
Joanna, I am in the poll but I don't There's team, A, B. C.

37
00:06:01,395 --> 00:06:07,395
And D. Is that what I'm supposed to be seeing Yes, so you would click on one.

38
00:06:07,395 --> 00:06:25,395
Oh, okay, thank you. Yes, thank you for that question. Was there another question

39
00:06:25,395 --> 00:06:33,395
And at the top I also want to know, Respond. I had you all go through a mobile device or a browser.

40
00:06:33,395 --> 00:06:45,395
But this type of question type, the multiple choice where you kind of pick one answer: has a text option. so for someone who doesn't have a smart phone.

41
00:06:45,395 --> 00:06:52,395
You. They could send a text here, and then it would

42
00:06:52,395 --> 00:07:04,395
They would be able to enter in their answer, using a B C or D in order to still participate

43
00:07:04,395 --> 00:07:15,395
Alright. so it seems like team A one. This poll they presented the most compelling case

44
00:07:15,395 --> 00:07:22,395
So another use case that you might do is knowledge checks you know the biggest thing you want to do when you're giving a long talk.

45
00:07:22,395 --> 00:07:26,395
It's seeing like it's is anybody with me you you know have we do.

46
00:07:26,395 --> 00:07:30,395
We have this concept, Is it safe for me to move on?

47
00:07:30,395 --> 00:07:43,395
And we can do that with knowledge checks let's see

48
00:07:43,395 --> 00:08:08,395
So if your screen didn't refresh you can refresh it, and you should see this next question, and again this is on the pole ev dot com site

49
00:08:08,395 --> 00:08:18,395
Over here in the lower right of my screen I can track how many people have responded.

50
00:08:18,395 --> 00:08:26,395
So if i'm waiting to hit a number a certain number you know if I have 20 students in the class, I can sit and wait.

51
00:08:26,395 --> 00:08:31,921
Until I have something close to 20 I May not get a 100%. And so I set this slide up a little bit different.

52
00:08:32,018 --> 00:08:37,018
So I set this poll up a little bit different. This has the question and the options.

53
00:08:37,018 --> 00:08:46,018
And these results are not rolling in in real time.

54
00:08:46,018 --> 00:08:57,018
Let's see if it has Yes, so this second slide. is who responded, or how people responded to this Poll.

55
00:08:57,018 --> 00:09:03,018
So we can see 4 people voted true, and then my third slide is going to go to the correctness.

56
00:09:03,018 --> 00:09:10,018
And because this question type had a correct, I set this to have a correct and incorrect answer.

57
00:09:10,018 --> 00:09:27,018
The third shows how we did so. It lets you present it in stages, or I could have just gone inserted this last slide, and we're gonna talk a little bit more about slide integrations like

58
00:09:27,018 --> 00:09:30,018
So this slide will be new for you but this is what We've been.

59
00:09:30,018 --> 00:09:35,018
I've been following onto pole everywhere, creating live interactive experiences.

60
00:09:35,018 --> 00:09:41,018
We tried a poll. We did a knowledge check now let's look at a Q. A.

61
00:09:41,018 --> 00:09:46,018
Option.

62
00:09:46,018 --> 00:10:00,018
So this is an open, ended question type, and this might be something you put up during a break, you know, if your class is long enough that you have a break in the middle, or maybe at the end of class.

63
00:10:00,018 --> 00:10:06,018
You can set a What questions do you have that we need to address?

64
00:10:06,018 --> 00:10:13,018
After the break the break. is Nice because that's live and we'll see those questions.

65
00:10:13,018 --> 00:10:22,018
When we get back and they'll actually appear here on the screen, I've prompted participants to ask a question or vote a question.

66
00:10:22,018 --> 00:10:27,018
It's gonna give them the ability to up vote and sort of move it in the rank of okay.

67
00:10:27,018 --> 00:10:42,018
A lot of people had this question excellent. There is a way you can pin a poll for maybe in between live sessions.

68
00:10:42,018 --> 00:10:45,018
So if this were something you were setting up after class of like, What What questions do you have?

69
00:10:45,018 --> 00:10:53,018
I can show you how to do that it's not as intuitive

70
00:10:53,018 --> 00:11:23,018
Set up a poll. Great gonna pull up mine one. And these are all anonymous

71
00:11:34,018 --> 00:11:36,018
And so this would work i've set this up as a Q.

72
00:11:36,018 --> 00:11:44,018
And A. But this Q. A. format can work for many different types of questions or comments.

73
00:11:44,018 --> 00:11:59,018
Anything that you might want to give. participants the ability to leave open ended, feedback, open-ended comments with the ability for other participants to sort of agree of.

74
00:11:59,018 --> 00:12:05,018
You don't have to say you know how to set up a poll, you know. 5 people don't have to type that in.

75
00:12:05,018 --> 00:12:20,018
You can just sort of upload them, as you see those coming in great

76
00:12:20,018 --> 00:12:24,018
And then pulls can just be used for fun. They can be ice breakers, they can be.

77
00:12:24,018 --> 00:12:37,018
We just need a mental break. let's take a break and do something different

78
00:12:37,018 --> 00:12:55,018
So who's your favorite marble movie character comic book character

79
00:12:55,018 --> 00:13:09,018
This is gonna be the word cloud format. This is great for a brainstorm or a a one word synthesis of

80
00:13:09,018 --> 00:13:15,018
What we learned in class today. It works well with one single words.

81
00:13:15,018 --> 00:13:45,018
You have to use an underscore instead of space, because if you insert a space, pull everywhere breaks the 2 words up separately.

82
00:13:46,018 --> 00:13:51,278
Group is a great answer.

83
00:13:54,143 --> 00:14:02,143
There's also a poll everywhere. mobile app and so this is something you end up using in a class regularly.

84
00:14:02,143 --> 00:14:13,143
There's a couple of things you might do one is you might have link your canvas roster to have students register for account.

85
00:14:13,143 --> 00:14:21,143
That would be an opportunity that you could actually give them credit for participating in the polls you give during class.

86
00:14:21,143 --> 00:14:27,143
I have these all set to anonymous because there's no requirements on any of you to interact.

87
00:14:27,143 --> 00:14:45,143
But you can sync your roster, and you can also encourage them to download the app for those who have smartphones for easy access, and they can log into that app, and save

88
00:14:45,143 --> 00:14:58,143
I wanna demo something on here

89
00:14:58,143 --> 00:15:04,143
Let's see how this goes. Oh, it didn't quite take it Yeah, it did.

90
00:15:04,143 --> 00:15:24,143
So you can use. i've been able to emojis also

91
00:15:24,143 --> 00:15:39,143
So you could create a using emojis. Tell me, what you did this weekend or tell me your favorite movie.

92
00:15:39,143 --> 00:15:49,143
So you can get creative with these

93
00:15:49,143 --> 00:15:57,143
So I wanna look briefly at question types how we actually build these in Poll everywhere.

94
00:15:57,143 --> 00:16:11,143
And so when I logged into my account and created a new activity. which is sort of the broad term for a poll question, I just want to briefly go over some of the question types multiple choice.

95
00:16:11,143 --> 00:16:21,143
So we use this when we had you vote on which team provided the best case

96
00:16:21,143 --> 00:16:28,143
The best argument for their case. and that was a more of a survey style where there wasn't a correct answer.

97
00:16:28,143 --> 00:16:38,143
We're just voting, and then we also use multiple choice on our question about the cellular, the stress on cells.

98
00:16:38,143 --> 00:16:43,143
Except I set that up to have a correct answer. So those were actually both multiple choice word cloud.

99
00:16:43,143 --> 00:16:49,143
We did the marble movie with the word cloud. Q. A.

100
00:16:49,143 --> 00:16:55,143
Is what we used for our Q. A. ask an upload questions.

101
00:16:55,143 --> 00:17:10,143
Clickable image is a style I didn't show you you do want to be careful with this one, because this is going to be a little bit more difficult for any students with that, with certain disabilities that require them to be able to

102
00:17:10,143 --> 00:17:19,143
touch on a specific image, see an image interpret an image in order to select a specific area.

103
00:17:19,143 --> 00:17:25,143
But a simple example would be putting a map of the world, or a map of the Us.

104
00:17:25,143 --> 00:17:40,143
Or a map of Michigan, and asking people where they're joining from where where they from if you're in a Zoom meeting, you can be where you're connecting from a survey would be I can

105
00:17:40,143 --> 00:17:45,143
post one question, and it's gonna have multiple questions so as you've seen on your end.

106
00:17:45,143 --> 00:17:58,143
You're responding to one question: at a time. but I could create a survey and put multiple questions that students can all complete in a row, and then we can go through

107
00:17:58,143 --> 00:18:06,143
The answer slides together. Open ended is just leaving comments.

108
00:18:06,143 --> 00:18:08,143
Open-end comments without the up voting.

109
00:18:08,143 --> 00:18:19,143
Feature and competition is a really neat woman. This would be sort of like for a test review or a test prep session, or this could be really fun in a discussion.

110
00:18:19,143 --> 00:18:28,143
Section where you're sort of students are competing against one another on their knowledge of the subject.

111
00:18:28,143 --> 00:18:34,143
Matter. and so this would be different questions, but in between each question there's a leader board.

112
00:18:34,143 --> 00:18:44,143
And so, however fast you answer, and accurate you're going to sort of move up in the leader board. that's another example of just a fun activity.

113
00:18:44,143 --> 00:18:46,143
And then this is the interface where you can put text.

114
00:18:46,143 --> 00:19:03,143
You can insert images, pull everywhere, allows you to add a text description, alt text. and so I would encourage you to definitely utilize that if you use any images, you can insert text image url or late tech if you're

115
00:19:03,143 --> 00:19:11,143
doing any problems like that

116
00:19:11,143 --> 00:19:17,143
So presenting polls with pull everywhere. So one nice thing is, it works well, for in person.

117
00:19:17,143 --> 00:19:27,143
And if it works well for online and in cases this is it recommended for your class feedings, but sometimes there's even events that are done hybrid.

118
00:19:27,143 --> 00:19:32,143
Right there's there's an event taking place in a physical room.

119
00:19:32,143 --> 00:19:36,143
But then, maybe it's also being live streamed and there are remote participants.

120
00:19:36,143 --> 00:19:44,143
Viewing. this is one tool that will work well with that both audience types.

121
00:19:44,143 --> 00:20:04,143
Because everyone is participating in the same way by going to pull ev dot com slash, Whatever your url is that has worked well. so I could present these from my polle everywhere account on on in a browser window.

122
00:20:04,143 --> 00:20:08,143
I have the browser up in a different screen here.

123
00:20:08,143 --> 00:20:13,143
What I did, though, was I inserted them into my presentation slides I'm.

124
00:20:13,143 --> 00:20:24,143
Using Google slides today, and there's a connector so that I could actually, when I added these pull questions in, I actually used the integration.

125
00:20:24,143 --> 00:20:33,143
So pull everywhere was actually a menu item i'll just escape and show you when I added this integration to my chrome browser.

126
00:20:33,143 --> 00:20:49,143
I now have a poll everywhere. Menu, right here in Google sleep sheets, or Google slides, where I can create an activity from scratch or in certain activity that I created in advance.

127
00:20:49,143 --> 00:21:04,143
There are some similar integrations with Powerpoint Powerpoint for Mac, Powerpoint, for windows, keynote for Mac

128
00:21:04,143 --> 00:21:09,143
And then there's also a slack integration so you could post a pull question to a slack channel.

129
00:21:09,143 --> 00:21:21,143
Even if you were with any groups or communities that way and then all of the results on slack instead of the results getting posted, live to the slack channel.

130
00:21:21,143 --> 00:21:37,143
They're actually going into your report. menu so you can see what the responses were to that There are a few things I want to just make you aware of, that are happening behind the scenes.

131
00:21:37,143 --> 00:21:40,143
That you just need to think through and just be aware of.

132
00:21:40,143 --> 00:21:48,143
So pull activation is a big part of how polls get posted to that response page.

133
00:21:48,143 --> 00:21:58,143
So you went to pull ev dot com to my url and the polls would switch on you, and that process where they're switching.

134
00:21:58,143 --> 00:22:04,143
It's called activation. when I integrate my polls into slides.

135
00:22:04,143 --> 00:22:11,143
As soon as I go. i'm in slideshow mode with those slides pull everywhere knows to activate it.

136
00:22:11,143 --> 00:22:23,143
So it's doing some behind the scenes work for me if I were presenting these live

137
00:22:23,143 --> 00:22:37,143
So here, this is This is the marble. Technically, the marvelous question is still activated, but I can deactivate it to close that.

138
00:22:37,143 --> 00:22:44,143
If I were presenting these from the web

139
00:22:44,143 --> 00:22:49,143
I'll open one, and so if I were using a browser tab to present these.

140
00:22:49,143 --> 00:22:56,143
Maybe I don't have slides i'm having a discussion with my participants.

141
00:22:56,143 --> 00:23:02,143
But maybe I do wanna toss in some polls and I so i'll just use a browser maybe instead of the slides.

142
00:23:02,143 --> 00:23:11,143
I would not need to manually activate each poll

143
00:23:11,143 --> 00:23:21,143
So again. this happens automatically when i'm integrating into a slide presentation, for example.

144
00:23:21,143 --> 00:23:28,143
But it has to be manually done if i'm presenting from the poll everywhere.

145
00:23:28,143 --> 00:23:44,143
Website. If I'm using an integration with powerpoint or Google Slide, I need to make sure that that integration is also in place on the device I'm presenting on.

146
00:23:44,143 --> 00:23:54,143
So this was easy for me, because I created this presentation on my work computer and I'm presenting it from my work computer.

147
00:23:54,143 --> 00:24:03,143
My office computer. So that makes it easy. But if I were preparing me about my office computer, where I have all my integration setup.

148
00:24:03,143 --> 00:24:08,143
But i'll be presenting in a classroom I need to do a test run.

149
00:24:08,143 --> 00:24:24,143
So getting there early, or maybe testing, if the week before to see if there's any the integrations need to be added, and making sure that I can add them, or if I need to get support from it, and calling classroom support for help with

150
00:24:24,143 --> 00:24:30,143
that and that just may depend on I think they're all fine to integrate on your own.

151
00:24:30,143 --> 00:24:37,143
That you don't need any an administrator to do that.

152
00:24:37,143 --> 00:24:42,143
But you do wanna just test that out before you go live.

153
00:24:42,143 --> 00:24:59,143
And then sometimes we are creating Polls that are going to be part of someone Else's presentation, particularly if you're part of a teaching team where your maybe Gsis are creating polls for you that you're going to insert into your lecture

154
00:24:59,143 --> 00:25:08,143
slides. We need to make sure that these are shared because otherwise you're gonna get there and it's gonna say I can't access pull everywhere.

155
00:25:08,143 --> 00:25:26,143
Cause you don't have access, to this question so there's some sharing that needs to happen. and one really great thing is, we can create teams in Poll everywhere and so you can get your teaching team as a team where you

156
00:25:26,143 --> 00:25:33,143
can easily share those polls, and those reports will all be sort of able to be combined.

157
00:25:33,143 --> 00:25:44,143
If you're running the same, set of polls in each discussion section, you'll then have that reporting to see how how well students did across all sections.

158
00:25:44,143 --> 00:25:53,143
So just some things I want to put in the back. Keep your mind

159
00:25:53,143 --> 00:25:59,143
So creating polls. The first thing we need to do is, have you all create accounts?

160
00:25:59,143 --> 00:26:16,143
So if you don't already have a free account you'll want to go to pull everywhere, dot com and a couple of you have poll everywhere accounts, and you're on the sph license, and that is aurora and

161
00:26:16,143 --> 00:26:18,143
Carolyn, so there's nothing you need to do here.

162
00:26:18,143 --> 00:26:25,143
But if you want to try, go ahead and log in at pole everywhere dot, com, and see if you still know that password.

163
00:26:25,143 --> 00:26:34,143
You can start working on that but I wanted to

164
00:26:34,143 --> 00:26:40,143
For the rest of you if you don't yet have a free poll everywhere account.

165
00:26:40,143 --> 00:26:48,143
I'll have you go to Paulaverway dot com and use the sign up Button

166
00:26:48,143 --> 00:27:00,143
And here's where you'll wanna indicate that you're gonna sign up as a presenter not as a poll participant

167
00:27:00,143 --> 00:27:08,143
You do have the ability to sign up with Google I signed up using my You Mish address through the Google integration.

168
00:27:08,143 --> 00:27:14,143
Since we use Google

169
00:27:14,143 --> 00:27:19,143
And you can fill out this information, or you can set up a password.

170
00:27:19,143 --> 00:27:27,143
Use your email and create a password if you'd like and go ahead and sign up

171
00:27:27,143 --> 00:27:37,143
After this session i'll be able to add you to the sph license

172
00:27:37,143 --> 00:27:53,143
For Now I just wanna make sure everyone gets that up so when you have completed that, or if it's already done, I'd like for you to go to the reactions

173
00:27:53,143 --> 00:28:13,143
And click the green check mark to say yes

174
00:28:13,143 --> 00:28:28,143
So i'm gonna wait until we have everybody in

175
00:28:28,143 --> 00:28:34,143
And if you have questions or running into issues, feel free to

176
00:28:34,143 --> 00:28:36,546
Put that in the chat

177
00:28:47,863 --> 00:29:04,863
Alright. So i'm gonna jump over back to mine and so in May take you directly to the activities Page

178
00:29:04,863 --> 00:29:09,863
So it usually wants to jump right in on the activities which has a big blue button that says, add activity.

179
00:29:09,863 --> 00:29:16,863
I want to back up just a quick moment and go to the home button in the left hand.

180
00:29:16,863 --> 00:29:32,863
Menu cause if you're signing up for the first time you may have a bit of a gobbledyook type of Url, and one thing I like to do is make this easily typable without a bunch of numbers

181
00:29:32,863 --> 00:29:39,863
on the end, or a bunch of words and so you should have to be able to click edit.

182
00:29:39,863 --> 00:29:45,863
Let me know if you don't see this or if you have to be on our account, to see this, or to have a disability.

183
00:29:45,863 --> 00:29:47,863
But you should have an edit button to sort of cut.

184
00:29:47,863 --> 00:29:59,863
Customize your own and I chose my unique name for this but I would suggest trying out and it'll tell you if it's not available.

185
00:29:59,863 --> 00:30:10,863
So that'll take you it'll jump you actually over to your account information your profile, and let you customize this Jana.

186
00:30:10,863 --> 00:30:17,863
One question. Yes, it does not let me change it. It says that I need to get a premium .

187
00:30:17,863 --> 00:30:23,863
What we are gonna get once you register us. yes, yes, apologies.

188
00:30:23,863 --> 00:30:26,863
So we'll good you Well, at least you know where that is located right? right?

189
00:30:26,863 --> 00:30:33,863
So once you recommend, Once you get us into it, then we we we will be able to change the name.

190
00:30:33,863 --> 00:30:39,863
That's correct. Yeah, thank you

191
00:30:39,863 --> 00:30:46,863
Yeah, Thank you for confirming that

192
00:30:46,863 --> 00:30:51,863
So i'll go to my activity page and so I have the ability to create an activity.

193
00:30:51,863 --> 00:31:03,863
But as we think about how we want to work. organize our activities, and i'll show you mine, so as you create polls, they just start populating in this list.

194
00:31:03,863 --> 00:31:10,863
And so I realized I need to sort of get a little more organized here, and so I could create a folder.

195
00:31:10,863 --> 00:31:13,863
And so I have folders for different sessions.

196
00:31:13,863 --> 00:31:22,863
So if you need one for a different class, or an orientation or things like that, different talks So that's gonna let you.

197
00:31:22,863 --> 00:31:38,863
So for this all everywhere, I was able to combine a bunch of polls that I could test out and see if I wanted to use

198
00:31:38,863 --> 00:31:46,863
I was able to duplicate the folder, so maybe I want to.

199
00:31:46,863 --> 00:31:58,863
Modify some of the questions in this one. I could duplicate this and modify them while retaining and not actually messing with my original ones, some of which have responses.

200
00:31:58,863 --> 00:32:10,863
So this one has 13 responses. that I I don't want to get rid of

201
00:32:10,863 --> 00:32:25,863
So if I click that plus activity here's where that screen turns into the screenshot, I showed you where you get to pick the question type and see what is recording what needs to be entered, what information, to provide in order to create

202
00:32:25,863 --> 00:32:32,863
that

203
00:32:32,863 --> 00:32:46,863
This more button has a lot of different options as well, most of them being sort of different, takes on these main ones.

204
00:32:46,863 --> 00:32:59,863
So they have the emotion scale, which is really the clickable image question, type

205
00:32:59,863 --> 00:33:13,863
Brainstorm.

206
00:33:13,863 --> 00:33:25,863
And then on each question type, I had some abilities to move, duplicate clear, which clears the responses.

207
00:33:25,863 --> 00:33:36,863
Not the question. So if I have a Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday class, and I wanna of the same section, and I wanna reuse the questions.

208
00:33:36,863 --> 00:34:03,863
I wanna clear out the responses from yesterday's class and so it's fresh for today's class, and even though you clear those you can still get reports on them which is nice delete log unlock send a copy

209
00:34:03,863 --> 00:34:13,863
And there's some more options here

210
00:34:13,863 --> 00:34:21,863
There's activities that are shared with me and I see some account level things, because i'm an account manager.

211
00:34:21,863 --> 00:34:33,863
But i'll also show you the reports tab quickly This is a clipboard icon on the far left

212
00:34:33,863 --> 00:34:45,863
These are some past reports that i've looked at

213
00:34:45,863 --> 00:34:55,863
There's several different report types. if I were taking these to the canvas grade book I would be able to see a grade book.

214
00:34:55,863 --> 00:35:06,863
Report, but executive summer kind of captures everything

215
00:35:06,863 --> 00:35:11,863
Let's see

216
00:35:11,863 --> 00:35:19,863
And when you have multiple iterations it'll give you the option to say, Yeah, over here, select run current run or all runs.

217
00:35:19,863 --> 00:35:40,863
So if I ran this poll several times. it would break that down for me, so I can get some analytics if I want, so you can sort of use it as as simplistic or as involved as you would like.

218
00:35:40,863 --> 00:36:10,863
So just take some time to click around and create an activity

219
00:36:20,863 --> 00:36:28,863
And so as you get started i'll send you a follow up information on how to customize your url once you're in the school Public health account.

220
00:36:28,863 --> 00:36:32,863
Create an activity. Please feel free to play around that With that.

221
00:36:32,863 --> 00:36:47,863
See the integrations, So you can build all of your polls on the Pole everywhere website, and you can install the Powerpoint or Google slide in augment later and insert them as slides into your presentation if

222
00:36:47,863 --> 00:36:53,863
you'd like i'll send you a link to show you how to install those.

223
00:36:53,863 --> 00:37:06,863
And then, as we talked about like, using it with teams you know you're done, or a teaching team, we unfortunately have to be the ones to create those teams, so you can share that content easily.

224
00:37:06,863 --> 00:37:16,863
But you also saw the manual like Send send a copy of this poll to

225
00:37:16,863 --> 00:37:19,863
That would split it up into 2 separate questions without the merged reports.

226
00:37:19,863 --> 00:37:27,863
But you do have that option and that you can do on your own, or if you send us the name of your team, we'll put you all together in a group.

227
00:37:27,863 --> 00:37:38,863
So that you can share those polls and see reporting

228
00:37:38,863 --> 00:38:02,863
Any questions on things you're seeing in there

229
00:38:02,863 --> 00:38:07,863
If you create a poll, and you want to share it.

230
00:38:07,863 --> 00:38:20,863
Drop your if you activate it on your end or let me know, and we'll we'll let you share your screen so you can activate it, and we can see the results

231
00:38:20,863 --> 00:38:26,863
All I have left for this session was, I just wanted to offer our consultation and support at X. Ph.

232
00:38:26,863 --> 00:38:31,863
Instruction at you, Mish Edu, you free to email us.

233
00:38:31,863 --> 00:38:36,863
If we can help you walk through this some initial setup answer questions.

234
00:38:36,863 --> 00:38:44,863
Or anything like that. help with troubleshooting

235
00:38:44,863 --> 00:38:54,863
And then more workshops this afternoon we're doing a panopto workshop for recording your invite class meetings in Sph today at one o'clock.

236
00:38:54,863 --> 00:38:58,863
That also has a zoom option if you'd like to sign up for that.

237
00:38:58,863 --> 00:39:02,863
We're also doing Monday a series for Gsi.

238
00:39:02,863 --> 00:39:21,863
So if you have any graduate student instructors, tas graders, please feel free to send them that the link which is on the sph events, calendar

239
00:39:21,863 --> 00:39:24,863
So this was pretty quick, because a lot of it has to be mostly.

240
00:39:24,863 --> 00:39:31,863
You know your own hands on experience, getting in creating your questions, types, your polls.

241
00:39:31,863 --> 00:40:00,863
And then practicing excuse so let me know if you have anything you wanna share.
