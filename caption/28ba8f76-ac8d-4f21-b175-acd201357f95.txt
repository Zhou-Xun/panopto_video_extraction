00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:13,935
Hi, Matt Zawistowski here.
In this lecture,

2
00:00:13,935 --> 00:00:16,634
I'm going to introduce
the MPLS dataset

3
00:00:16,634 --> 00:00:18,150
that we'll use as an example

4
00:00:18,150 --> 00:00:20,710
for studying longitudinal data.

5
00:00:20,710 --> 00:00:24,305
We'll be using the same dataset
that is in the textbook,

6
00:00:24,305 --> 00:00:26,210
Longitudinal Data Analysis for

7
00:00:26,210 --> 00:00:29,510
the behavioral sciences
using R by Jeffrey Long.

8
00:00:29,510 --> 00:00:31,700
My hope is that this
will allow you to

9
00:00:31,700 --> 00:00:34,295
closely follow these
examples in two formats,

10
00:00:34,295 --> 00:00:36,785
the textbook and
the video lectures.

11
00:00:36,785 --> 00:00:39,560
We'll be exploring
academic progress data

12
00:00:39,560 --> 00:00:40,670
collected on children

13
00:00:40,670 --> 00:00:42,620
from the Minnesota
Public School District

14
00:00:42,620 --> 00:00:44,680
beginning in 2004.

15
00:00:44,680 --> 00:00:48,290
We'll refer to the
dataset as the MPLS data.

16
00:00:48,290 --> 00:00:51,020
This is real data collected
in accordance with

17
00:00:51,020 --> 00:00:54,385
the 2002 No Child
Left Behind Act.

18
00:00:54,385 --> 00:00:57,770
Specifically, we'll be looking
at achievement scores on

19
00:00:57,770 --> 00:00:59,660
standardized reading tests for

20
00:00:59,660 --> 00:01:02,395
students in the Minnesota
Public School District.

21
00:01:02,395 --> 00:01:04,790
Our goal will be to
apply the methods

22
00:01:04,790 --> 00:01:07,010
discussed in lectures
to understand how

23
00:01:07,010 --> 00:01:10,340
to scores change over time
and determine the effects

24
00:01:10,340 --> 00:01:12,065
of factors such as homelessness

25
00:01:12,065 --> 00:01:14,540
and poverty on that change.

26
00:01:14,540 --> 00:01:17,089
Following the lead
of the textbook,

27
00:01:17,089 --> 00:01:18,260
we will only be looking at

28
00:01:18,260 --> 00:01:21,480
a small subset of the
complete MPLS data.

29
00:01:21,480 --> 00:01:25,714
While the full dataset
contains over 16,000 students,

30
00:01:25,714 --> 00:01:27,350
we will apply our methods to

31
00:01:27,350 --> 00:01:29,944
a random sample of 22 students.

32
00:01:29,944 --> 00:01:32,330
Despite using this "toy" dataset,

33
00:01:32,330 --> 00:01:34,340
we will get the
opportunity to analyze

34
00:01:34,340 --> 00:01:36,230
real longitudinal data based

35
00:01:36,230 --> 00:01:38,194
on real motivating questions.

36
00:01:38,194 --> 00:01:40,400
The small sample
size is perfectly

37
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:42,590
suitable for learning
important concepts of

38
00:01:42,590 --> 00:01:44,750
longitudinal data analysis and

39
00:01:44,750 --> 00:01:47,120
actually makes the
examples more manageable.

40
00:01:47,120 --> 00:01:49,100
But please know that since we are

41
00:01:49,100 --> 00:01:50,989
considering so few students,

42
00:01:50,989 --> 00:01:53,600
the results of these analysis
should not be used to

43
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:57,340
infer larger issues in
academic achievement.

44
00:01:57,340 --> 00:02:00,260
The first thing we'll
do is walk through

45
00:02:00,260 --> 00:02:03,500
the variables available
in the dataset.

46
00:02:03,500 --> 00:02:05,510
Each student is given

47
00:02:05,510 --> 00:02:07,265
a unique identification number

48
00:02:07,265 --> 00:02:10,085
called Subid or subject ID.

49
00:02:10,085 --> 00:02:12,260
Note that the subject ID is

50
00:02:12,260 --> 00:02:15,215
an example of creating a
de-identified dataset.

51
00:02:15,215 --> 00:02:18,185
Because we would likely not
be able to determine who

52
00:02:18,185 --> 00:02:21,890
any specific student is
based on their subject ID.

53
00:02:21,890 --> 00:02:25,550
Contrast this with potential
identification variables,

54
00:02:25,550 --> 00:02:27,470
such as social security number,

55
00:02:27,470 --> 00:02:30,455
school ID, or the
students actual name.

56
00:02:30,455 --> 00:02:32,795
Each of which would
uniquely identify

57
00:02:32,795 --> 00:02:35,995
who each student
in the dataset is.

58
00:02:35,995 --> 00:02:38,615
Next, we have the
reading scores for

59
00:02:38,615 --> 00:02:41,990
each student recorded in the
fifth through eighth grades.

60
00:02:41,990 --> 00:02:45,365
This is the piece that makes
this a longitudinal dataset.

61
00:02:45,365 --> 00:02:47,975
The fact that we have
repeated measurements

62
00:02:47,975 --> 00:02:50,915
on the same variable
taken over time.

63
00:02:50,915 --> 00:02:53,060
You might notice that there are

64
00:02:53,060 --> 00:02:54,905
some strange-looking test scores.

65
00:02:54,905 --> 00:02:57,260
The negative 99's, That's

66
00:02:57,260 --> 00:03:00,770
a good catch and we will
return to those later.

67
00:03:00,770 --> 00:03:04,880
Next, we have several demographic
variables that we can

68
00:03:04,880 --> 00:03:06,785
use to study potential factors

69
00:03:06,785 --> 00:03:08,980
influencing reading test scores.

70
00:03:08,980 --> 00:03:11,630
The risk variable
classifies students

71
00:03:11,630 --> 00:03:14,525
based on whether they're
homeless or highly mobile,

72
00:03:14,525 --> 00:03:17,680
in poverty or advantaged.

73
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:21,175
We also have student gender,

74
00:03:21,175 --> 00:03:23,825
student ethnicity with options of

75
00:03:23,825 --> 00:03:27,005
African-American,
Hispanic, or white.

76
00:03:27,005 --> 00:03:28,910
An indicator for whether

77
00:03:28,910 --> 00:03:31,790
the student is an English
language learner.

78
00:03:31,790 --> 00:03:34,610
An indicator for whether
the student receives

79
00:03:34,610 --> 00:03:37,940
special education and finally,

80
00:03:37,940 --> 00:03:39,350
a measure of attendance,

81
00:03:39,350 --> 00:03:42,080
specifically the proportion
of days the student

82
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:45,775
attended school over the
data collection period.

83
00:03:45,775 --> 00:03:48,455
When you initially
download the data,

84
00:03:48,455 --> 00:03:50,705
it comes in what is
called wide format.

85
00:03:50,705 --> 00:03:54,635
This means that each row
corresponds to just one student.

86
00:03:54,635 --> 00:03:56,810
All repeated
measurement test scores

87
00:03:56,810 --> 00:03:58,760
will be contained
in that one row.

88
00:03:58,760 --> 00:04:00,800
The wide format is useful when

89
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:02,870
computing descriptive
statistics for

90
00:04:02,870 --> 00:04:04,880
the variables
because each student

91
00:04:04,880 --> 00:04:07,250
is represented only
once in a column.

92
00:04:07,250 --> 00:04:10,729
Later, when we want to analyze
the repeated measurements,

93
00:04:10,729 --> 00:04:12,110
we will convert the data to

94
00:04:12,110 --> 00:04:16,460
the long format in which each
test score has its own row.

95
00:04:16,460 --> 00:04:20,000
For example, here you can
see the difference between

96
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,845
the wide and long formats

97
00:04:21,845 --> 00:04:24,755
for the first two
students in the dataset.

98
00:04:24,755 --> 00:04:26,869
In the wide format,

99
00:04:26,869 --> 00:04:28,130
the first student has

100
00:04:28,130 --> 00:04:31,315
just a single row with
all four reading scores.

101
00:04:31,315 --> 00:04:33,260
In contrast, this student

102
00:04:33,260 --> 00:04:35,585
has four rows in the long format,

103
00:04:35,585 --> 00:04:38,075
one for each test score.

104
00:04:38,075 --> 00:04:42,650
The long formatted dataset
will be what is expected for

105
00:04:42,650 --> 00:04:47,390
many are functions designed
to analyze longitudinal data.

106
00:04:47,390 --> 00:04:49,790
Now let's go back
to those negative

107
00:04:49,790 --> 00:04:52,900
99's we previously
saw in the dataset.

108
00:04:52,900 --> 00:04:55,715
Those actually correspond
to missing data.

109
00:04:55,715 --> 00:04:57,980
They indicate tests
for which we do not

110
00:04:57,980 --> 00:05:00,335
have a measurement for
the respective student.

111
00:05:00,335 --> 00:05:02,210
We don't know if the
score is missing

112
00:05:02,210 --> 00:05:04,445
because the student
did not take the test.

113
00:05:04,445 --> 00:05:07,190
The score is missing
from the records or

114
00:05:07,190 --> 00:05:08,540
it's possible that
the student has

115
00:05:08,540 --> 00:05:10,430
not made it to that grade yet.

116
00:05:10,430 --> 00:05:12,170
Regardless of the reason,

117
00:05:12,170 --> 00:05:13,910
it's important to
know how missing data

118
00:05:13,910 --> 00:05:15,950
is recorded in a given dataset.

119
00:05:15,950 --> 00:05:17,975
When reading the data into R,

120
00:05:17,975 --> 00:05:19,789
It is good practice to explicitly

121
00:05:19,789 --> 00:05:22,415
specify the indicator
for missing data.

122
00:05:22,415 --> 00:05:24,050
Imagine for these Data,

123
00:05:24,050 --> 00:05:25,370
how your analysis might be

124
00:05:25,370 --> 00:05:28,160
affected if the negative
99's were ignored.

125
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:29,600
Since they are numbers,

126
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:31,340
R would just think
they're test scores like

127
00:05:31,340 --> 00:05:32,960
all the other
numbers and it would

128
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:35,530
really throw off your analysis.

129
00:05:35,530 --> 00:05:39,530
Let's take a minute to think
about what makes this MPLS

130
00:05:39,530 --> 00:05:41,180
dataset an example of

131
00:05:41,180 --> 00:05:44,185
repeated measures,
longitudinal data.

132
00:05:44,185 --> 00:05:46,190
If we are interested in reading

133
00:05:46,190 --> 00:05:48,425
test scores from fifth
to eighth grade,

134
00:05:48,425 --> 00:05:50,120
there are a couple
ways we could have

135
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:52,835
designed the study and
collected the data.

136
00:05:52,835 --> 00:05:55,310
In the data for our example,

137
00:05:55,310 --> 00:05:57,230
students that were
in the fifth grade

138
00:05:57,230 --> 00:05:59,360
in the Minnesota Public
School District,

139
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:02,015
beginning in the
2004 academic year,

140
00:06:02,015 --> 00:06:04,090
were defined to be
the study cohort.

141
00:06:04,090 --> 00:06:06,275
They were initial reading scores

142
00:06:06,275 --> 00:06:08,480
from the fifth grade
were collected.

143
00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:12,080
The same set of students was
then followed over time,

144
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:14,660
collecting test scores
at the next grades.

145
00:06:14,660 --> 00:06:16,910
Meaning that sixth
grade test scores were

146
00:06:16,910 --> 00:06:19,190
collected for the same
students for which we

147
00:06:19,190 --> 00:06:22,380
collected fifth grade
test scores and

148
00:06:22,380 --> 00:06:26,325
so on for seventh and
eighth grade test scores.

149
00:06:26,325 --> 00:06:28,580
The test scores across grades on

150
00:06:28,580 --> 00:06:31,970
the same student are correlated
repeated measurements.

151
00:06:31,970 --> 00:06:34,910
Because we have multiple
measurements per student,

152
00:06:34,910 --> 00:06:36,920
we can directly
observed changes in

153
00:06:36,920 --> 00:06:39,740
test scores over time
within a student.

154
00:06:39,740 --> 00:06:42,530
We can actually see the
progression of scores over

155
00:06:42,530 --> 00:06:45,155
time and determine
if scores increase,

156
00:06:45,155 --> 00:06:49,325
decrease, or remain constant
on an individual level.

157
00:06:49,325 --> 00:06:52,100
In contrast, let's think about

158
00:06:52,100 --> 00:06:53,870
a different way this study of

159
00:06:53,870 --> 00:06:56,555
test scores could
have been performed.

160
00:06:56,555 --> 00:06:58,670
Another approach would be to

161
00:06:58,670 --> 00:07:00,380
collect a single
reading score from

162
00:07:00,380 --> 00:07:02,270
different students spread across

163
00:07:02,270 --> 00:07:04,040
the fifth to eighth grades.

164
00:07:04,040 --> 00:07:05,900
That is, for each grade,

165
00:07:05,900 --> 00:07:07,550
the reading scores
are collected from

166
00:07:07,550 --> 00:07:09,400
a different set of students.

167
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:12,665
This would be an example of
a cross-sectional design.

168
00:07:12,665 --> 00:07:14,840
Notice the major
difference between

169
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:17,345
the cross-sectional and
longitudinal designs.

170
00:07:17,345 --> 00:07:19,745
We cannot directly
observe changes for

171
00:07:19,745 --> 00:07:22,625
individual students in the
cross-sectional study.

172
00:07:22,625 --> 00:07:24,440
Instead, we're looking at

173
00:07:24,440 --> 00:07:27,275
test scores in different
students in different grades.

174
00:07:27,275 --> 00:07:29,045
Think of this student
for whom we have

175
00:07:29,045 --> 00:07:31,570
only her sixth grade test score.

176
00:07:31,570 --> 00:07:35,180
Since we do not have the
additional test scores for her,

177
00:07:35,180 --> 00:07:38,285
we don't know what her
actual change over time is.

178
00:07:38,285 --> 00:07:40,595
It might be a sharp increase

179
00:07:40,595 --> 00:07:42,650
or it might be relatively flat.

180
00:07:42,650 --> 00:07:44,575
We just don't know.

181
00:07:44,575 --> 00:07:48,140
It is for this reason that
trying to infer within

182
00:07:48,140 --> 00:07:50,270
subject change over time from

183
00:07:50,270 --> 00:07:53,480
cross-sectional data is
prone to confounding.

184
00:07:53,480 --> 00:07:55,160
There might be factors that

185
00:07:55,160 --> 00:07:56,600
differ between the students in

186
00:07:56,600 --> 00:07:58,220
different grades and confounds

187
00:07:58,220 --> 00:08:00,755
the relationship between
test score and grade.

188
00:08:00,755 --> 00:08:02,750
For example, the quality of

189
00:08:02,750 --> 00:08:05,435
teachers might differ
across grades.

190
00:08:05,435 --> 00:08:07,790
The repeated measures collected

191
00:08:07,790 --> 00:08:09,470
through the longitudinal design

192
00:08:09,470 --> 00:08:11,270
allows direct observation of

193
00:08:11,270 --> 00:08:13,580
the change in scores
for each dataset,

194
00:08:13,580 --> 00:08:17,200
reducing the impact of potential
confounding variables.

195
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:18,830
The drawback is that

196
00:08:18,830 --> 00:08:22,100
longitudinal data collection
often takes time.

197
00:08:22,100 --> 00:08:24,170
For example, if we
had to wait for

198
00:08:24,170 --> 00:08:27,205
the students to progress
from fifth to eighth grade.

199
00:08:27,205 --> 00:08:29,140
However, for this scenario,

200
00:08:29,140 --> 00:08:31,045
that might not even be the case.

201
00:08:31,045 --> 00:08:32,680
It may be possible to go into

202
00:08:32,680 --> 00:08:35,290
the student records to
extract test scores from

203
00:08:35,290 --> 00:08:37,690
previous grades
all at one time if

204
00:08:37,690 --> 00:08:41,150
the student has already
progressed beyond eighth grade.

205
00:08:41,150 --> 00:08:43,825
That's the MPLS dataset.

206
00:08:43,825 --> 00:08:46,404
We'll be using it as an
example to demonstrate

207
00:08:46,404 --> 00:08:48,430
longitudinal data
analysis methods

208
00:08:48,430 --> 00:08:50,205
presented in this course.

209
00:08:50,205 --> 00:08:53,770
MPLS contains repeated
measurements of reading

210
00:08:53,770 --> 00:08:55,420
test scores that are likely to be

211
00:08:55,420 --> 00:08:57,430
correlated within
the same student.

212
00:08:57,430 --> 00:08:59,620
In subsequent lectures, we will

213
00:08:59,620 --> 00:09:02,200
apply methods for co-rrelated
data to learn about

214
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:04,630
within student changes
in test scores over

215
00:09:04,630 --> 00:09:07,015
time and between student factors

216
00:09:07,015 --> 00:09:09,781
that might affect that change.
