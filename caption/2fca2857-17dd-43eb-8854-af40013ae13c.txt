1
00:00:06,360 --> 00:00:12,930
One thing to mention the sun, like most glasses will go jumbled at the end of class.

2
00:00:13,470 --> 00:00:17,700
But I want to make sure people are able to be in the groups that ingest them the most.

3
00:00:18,210 --> 00:00:21,480
So these are the discussions we'll be having at the end of class.

4
00:00:21,810 --> 00:00:27,540
And if there is any topic that really that you'd want to be part of,

5
00:00:28,530 --> 00:00:32,909
send Jonathan a message and we'll make sure that you're in that group at the same time.

6
00:00:32,910 --> 00:00:38,940
It is a topic you really don't want to discuss. Send Jonathan a message and we'll make sure you're not in that group.

7
00:00:44,360 --> 00:00:48,420
So we'll be talking about water, sanitation and hygiene.

8
00:00:48,440 --> 00:00:54,500
Today, we'll go over what washes. The global burden of water washed infectious diseases.

9
00:00:55,310 --> 00:01:03,200
The five FS model wash interventions. And then a bit on gender and wash followed by the small group discussion.

10
00:01:03,980 --> 00:01:08,840
And hopefully the lecture shouldn't take too long. It'll be quite discussion heavy.

11
00:01:13,330 --> 00:01:17,680
So what is wash? Wash stands for water, sanitation and hygiene.

12
00:01:17,980 --> 00:01:21,940
So it's pretty much any health condition you can think of, which is impacted by water.

13
00:01:23,020 --> 00:01:29,259
So the provision of safe water or if water's dirty and contaminated sanitation,

14
00:01:29,260 --> 00:01:38,110
which is generally safe removal of human waste products like feces and urine as well as environmental sanitation.

15
00:01:38,110 --> 00:01:42,340
So making sure environments are clean and free of garbage and also hygiene,

16
00:01:43,060 --> 00:01:48,550
making sure that people have access to handwashing facilities and showers and those kind of things.

17
00:01:49,510 --> 00:01:56,230
There's also been some talk as of as of recent to add air to wash,

18
00:01:56,530 --> 00:02:03,010
making sure people have safe air that is good ventilation is free from pollutants and and airborne pathogens.

19
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:10,690
But for the purposes of this lecture, we'll stick to the more classic definition, which is water, sanitation and hygiene.

20
00:02:13,160 --> 00:02:17,870
So what does is it impacted by Wash? And there's a few different types in there.

21
00:02:17,930 --> 00:02:24,740
The first type is called a water borne disease. And those are pathogens which are found in water which you consume.

22
00:02:25,100 --> 00:02:28,510
So think about cholera, polio or rotavirus.

23
00:02:28,520 --> 00:02:31,340
So those kind of those kind of diseases.

24
00:02:32,090 --> 00:02:39,200
The level to wash diseases, these diseases which which are more prevalent if you don't have clean water for washing.

25
00:02:39,500 --> 00:02:44,720
So scabies, which is a skin disease or trachoma, which is a an eye disease,

26
00:02:45,260 --> 00:02:49,280
which one of the groups will be discussing to learn more about that in the discussion period?

27
00:02:50,570 --> 00:03:00,049
Water based diseases. So these are diseases which are found in host organisms that live in water like schistosomiasis,

28
00:03:00,050 --> 00:03:04,760
which is found in snails and then transmits to humans and freshwater.

29
00:03:06,070 --> 00:03:10,680
Insect vector diseases like malaria or left menaces.

30
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:20,560
These diseases, which are spread by insects and the insects find breeding grounds in the water and in landfills, those kind of places.

31
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:27,120
We won't talk about insect vector diseases today because you'll have a full lecture on that day with Dr. Wells.

32
00:03:28,210 --> 00:03:33,100
Then the sanitation is well, sanitation has a lot of impact.

33
00:03:33,220 --> 00:03:41,620
Most water affects diseases, but it also looks at different environmental factors like garbage disposal, which impacts vector borne diseases,

34
00:03:41,950 --> 00:03:49,000
and also environmental sanitation, which which impacts soil transmitted diseases like soil transmitted helminths.

35
00:03:49,750 --> 00:03:54,130
And finally, hygiene. Hygiene as well is really impactful on the water.

36
00:03:54,160 --> 00:03:58,630
Wash diseases. But you also include menstrual hygiene in that as well.

37
00:04:00,920 --> 00:04:04,850
So you talk about the burden of a few different wash related diseases.

38
00:04:05,130 --> 00:04:09,380
Over here we have a graph showing the burden of acute watery diarrhea,

39
00:04:09,650 --> 00:04:18,950
which is normally defined as having five or more side or more loose stools over a over a 24 hour period.

40
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:24,469
On the top, you can look at the mortality rate that's per 100,000.

41
00:04:24,470 --> 00:04:30,260
So how many of all deaths, how many of 100 other people in the population, how many deaths is it causing?

42
00:04:30,590 --> 00:04:36,579
And you can see it's it's generally quite high throughout sub-Saharan Africa,

43
00:04:36,580 --> 00:04:43,130
a bit of northern Africa, as well as Southern Asia and a bit in South East Asia.

44
00:04:45,060 --> 00:04:51,690
But that sort of general population, if you look at the bottom map, you look at the under-five mortality rate per 100,000,

45
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:56,280
and you can see some really, really high rates, particularly in Central Africa.

46
00:04:57,750 --> 00:05:01,930
This country over here having a rate of over 500 deaths per 100,000.

47
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:11,880
And you have even higher quite high rates as well in West Africa and Madagascar, in Zimbabwe, as well as in Angola.

48
00:05:13,590 --> 00:05:21,810
And these rates are really associated with, you know, poor water supplies for water supplies and poor water treatment systems.

49
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:29,370
And this really makes diarrhea, the second highest cause of under five deaths globally.

50
00:05:32,390 --> 00:05:39,680
Tacoma as well is a pretty big issue, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa and southern and central and Eastern Asia.

51
00:05:40,490 --> 00:05:45,500
So trachoma is a parasitic infection which enters the eye cause blindness.

52
00:05:45,590 --> 00:05:47,960
The treatment for this is actually quite, quite horrific.

53
00:05:50,060 --> 00:05:53,960
What they have to do is actually make an incision in the eye to get the parasite out of there.

54
00:05:55,370 --> 00:06:01,010
And quite often, there aren't a lot of skilled health care providers who could do this and a lot of countries.

55
00:06:01,580 --> 00:06:03,110
So it leads to permanent blindness.

56
00:06:03,950 --> 00:06:12,320
Our goal is to eliminate trachoma in the next ten years, but it seems extremely challenging, particularly considering where it is,

57
00:06:12,830 --> 00:06:18,410
especially throughout northern and sub-Saharan Africa, just because there isn't a health infrastructure there.

58
00:06:18,980 --> 00:06:26,090
And it's also difficult to find cases over there to to treat and then to eliminate trachoma, infections.

59
00:06:29,150 --> 00:06:41,200
This is a symbiosis. Like like I mentioned earlier, is a disease which is found in snails and freshwater and can and can transmit to people.

60
00:06:41,330 --> 00:06:46,580
Over here we have the life cycle of schistosomiasis.

61
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:54,020
So we'll start off in the first or final stage, depending how you look at it, where in feces,

62
00:06:54,290 --> 00:07:03,370
the schistosomiasis eggs are deposited in freshwater, they will hatch and then go into the tissue of a snail.

63
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:10,760
They'll reproduce in the snail and then be released from the snail and then penetrate the skin of people swimming in freshwater.

64
00:07:12,710 --> 00:07:20,930
It'll then circulate throughout the bloodstream of people, get into liver and then eventually defecate it out again into freshwater.

65
00:07:22,640 --> 00:07:27,530
And this is and if you look at the map of where it's prevalent, you can really see over here around the lake,

66
00:07:27,530 --> 00:07:31,610
the region has increased prevalence really because of all of that freshwater

67
00:07:32,540 --> 00:07:38,510
also as well in northwest Africa and a little bit of central and southern Asia.

68
00:07:39,320 --> 00:07:41,990
And this is a disease as well which is targeted for elimination.

69
00:07:41,990 --> 00:07:52,820
But because it's so difficult to find cases of it and to and to decrease the prevalence of it in snails, in freshwater, it's really quite difficult.

70
00:07:53,150 --> 00:07:59,690
And also just to mention as well, if you if you're ever, you know, swimming in fresh water in one of these countries,

71
00:07:59,690 --> 00:08:05,330
you need to be quite careful not to get schistosomiasis and maybe get some prophylactic medications to make sure that you don't get it.

72
00:08:08,130 --> 00:08:14,910
And then Sol transmitted a helmet. So these are these are worms like cook worms which are inside soil.

73
00:08:15,210 --> 00:08:20,970
And the main way of spreading is actually something called g.o.a.t, which is when people eat dirt.

74
00:08:21,570 --> 00:08:26,639
It happens most often with babies when they're sitting on the ground on the floor and they

75
00:08:26,640 --> 00:08:30,750
might just ingest because of nutritional deficiencies or because they're bored or whatever,

76
00:08:31,320 --> 00:08:33,990
or even if the food is just contaminated.

77
00:08:34,890 --> 00:08:42,030
And there's a really large burn throughout the world, but especially in Southeast Asia and in Southern Africa.

78
00:08:42,900 --> 00:08:46,020
And this is associated with a lot of under-five diarrhea.

79
00:08:46,020 --> 00:08:53,489
And it's one of the things that really contributes to that really high burden of deaths attributable to, um, five diarrhea,

80
00:08:53,490 --> 00:08:58,770
which we talked about at the beginning and again just on this as well for keeping yourself safe when you travel,

81
00:08:59,280 --> 00:09:05,940
if you spend more than six months in a lot of the countries that are on here, you should probably get yourself drummed.

82
00:09:06,690 --> 00:09:12,840
I give myself due every few years, but I know I've been traveling a lot to some of these places, especially to South Africa,

83
00:09:13,650 --> 00:09:20,760
because even if it doesn't cause diarrhea, it can cause strokes and heart attacks and all kinds of other horrific diseases.

84
00:09:22,430 --> 00:09:28,159
And then mental hygiene. Mental hygiene is an interesting topic because there actually isn't too much data on it.

85
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:36,570
So if anybody wants to go into research and and, you know, is looking for global health topics, research, mental hygiene is a fantastic one.

86
00:09:36,630 --> 00:09:48,920
And looking at infections caused due to due to inadequate access to menstrual products or stigmatization or or access to dementia products.

87
00:09:49,160 --> 00:09:54,290
You know, there's a whole wealth of research topics that you really under under examine, which would be fantastic.

88
00:09:54,290 --> 00:10:05,480
People look at. Um, but one good way of at least getting some idea of access to mental products is looking at the size of the hygiene market.

89
00:10:05,750 --> 00:10:10,880
So this is how many pads are sold, a tampons are sold or or menstrual cups are sold.

90
00:10:11,330 --> 00:10:21,650
And in in South America and throughout Africa, sub-Saharan Africa and Northern Africa, the market is really tiny and in.

91
00:10:23,380 --> 00:10:29,260
This causes quite a few issues, obviously, and not at the immediate moment having access to major products.

92
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:34,360
But the main concern comes in that if there's a small market,

93
00:10:34,360 --> 00:10:40,870
you wouldn't expect that to be a a growth and utilization and access to domestic products because,

94
00:10:41,230 --> 00:10:46,330
you know, for better or for worse, you live in a world where the market controls control, the products are available.

95
00:10:46,540 --> 00:10:51,730
So the main intervention over here is to strengthen these markets, to make sure the products are available.

96
00:10:54,170 --> 00:10:59,330
So now we're going to move onto wash interventions and we're going to start off by talking about this figure.

97
00:10:59,630 --> 00:11:01,460
This is called the five X Figure.

98
00:11:02,900 --> 00:11:11,090
And it kind of shows how water, how enteric pathogens and other water based pathogens, water that patterns move through an environment.

99
00:11:11,390 --> 00:11:16,850
So generally they come out the feces of an infected person, or it could be to some other way to an infected person.

100
00:11:17,270 --> 00:11:22,159
And ideally, what would happen here is a toilet barrier would stop it from going into the environment,

101
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:26,690
out into fluids or into floors and soil or flies.

102
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:32,049
Beyond Taliban here. You also want to think about it going into people's fingers as well.

103
00:11:32,050 --> 00:11:39,670
Awfully difficult. From fluids if you have safe water and we'll talk about how you can make water safe in the second.

104
00:11:39,940 --> 00:11:47,940
Then you can have a barrier that stopped passengers. For fields and flows of soil or flies or fingers.

105
00:11:47,940 --> 00:11:53,429
Then you have a hygiene barrier so people can wash their hands or you eliminate flies through vector

106
00:11:53,430 --> 00:11:58,290
control and looking at garbage in landfills all you make sure that fields and floors are safe,

107
00:11:58,290 --> 00:12:04,470
either through disinfection or what's most commonly done is just having good flooring for having concrete floors that you can clean,

108
00:12:05,220 --> 00:12:13,510
and that should hopefully stop it from getting into food. Now, if that fails and it gets into food, it's done inside the person.

109
00:12:13,510 --> 00:12:18,940
But then you want to have another Heisenberg to make sure it's not getting from that person again into new house.

110
00:12:18,940 --> 00:12:22,920
So think about a mother who's eating and needs to eat and wash your hands.

111
00:12:22,930 --> 00:12:28,780
Make sure she is, and then giving it to her child. And a lot of a lot of wash interventions are based on this model.

112
00:12:30,370 --> 00:12:36,580
So there's quite a few water interventions. So we want to talk about to all of them because that would be a course all in itself.

113
00:12:37,150 --> 00:12:42,310
But we will touch on the main ones and they can come at different levels at the community level.

114
00:12:43,390 --> 00:12:47,950
You can have safe piped water to the home or the community for that.

115
00:12:47,950 --> 00:12:53,349
That's that's obviously sitting in the water. Your piping is safe. If it is, this is really the gold standard.

116
00:12:53,350 --> 00:12:59,350
And the best thing you can do in emergency scenarios, you often also have chucked water.

117
00:12:59,350 --> 00:13:03,940
So they'll come with a big water truck and people go there and fill up their containers.

118
00:13:04,660 --> 00:13:09,820
Or you could also have bottled water distribution. That's only done, you know, in the most emergent of scenarios.

119
00:13:11,050 --> 00:13:18,850
Then you can have safe water interventions at a household level. Solar disinfection is a really is a really good one.

120
00:13:19,090 --> 00:13:26,740
You can use where you put water into transparent containers and you leave it out in the sun for for a little while.

121
00:13:26,860 --> 00:13:32,140
The amount of time you leave it on the sun really depends on the amount of water you have, the intensity of sun.

122
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:38,170
But this is one that actually works really well, even though it does have some controversy sometimes.

123
00:13:38,740 --> 00:13:45,370
Rainwater collection is also quite good. Rainwater is always safe, but you need to be very careful for that one, that it's not a gun of water.

124
00:13:45,370 --> 00:13:52,000
So collecting dirt from a roof or something like that and that a container is using a safe and also household filtration.

125
00:13:52,660 --> 00:13:54,220
There are a bunch of products on this,

126
00:13:54,550 --> 00:14:00,250
but essentially the filters you can put in a household based on charcoal or something else and they'll filter out the water.

127
00:14:01,300 --> 00:14:02,800
The final one is chlorination,

128
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:11,350
which you might remember from the humanitarian aid work a few a few lectures ago where you can put chlorine tablets inside of water.

129
00:14:12,310 --> 00:14:15,340
But like we mentioned, this has a whole host of issues.

130
00:14:15,340 --> 00:14:21,739
The water doesn't taste very good. People might not know how to use the chlorine tablets and because of those, they might just not use them.

131
00:14:21,740 --> 00:14:30,430
It might just drink unsafe water. The other thing to consider with chlorination is that after some time the chlorine degrades and when that happens,

132
00:14:30,430 --> 00:14:33,850
it's no longer considered chlorinated and could be contaminated again.

133
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:42,749
There are few other considerations you want to have as well when when you are putting in what interventions the first is,

134
00:14:42,750 --> 00:14:47,850
what type of vessel are using to store water. You can see over here that quite a few different types.

135
00:14:47,850 --> 00:14:53,100
You have the jerry cans here, you have the big bucket, you have the open bucket and you have a few other ones.

136
00:14:53,910 --> 00:14:58,920
What do you want to think about? Is, is two things you don't think about, but quite a few things, but are two main ones.

137
00:14:59,220 --> 00:15:04,590
The first is, can everybody carry the water if you're having this like massive, massive bucket?

138
00:15:05,590 --> 00:15:14,979
Chances are that a lot children and also, you know, perhaps women, depending on on the context, might not be able to carry that massive bucket.

139
00:15:14,980 --> 00:15:19,330
So you're really making men, the people who control the water,

140
00:15:19,930 --> 00:15:25,540
which you obviously want to avoid dousing as you want to avoid having massive open containers.

141
00:15:25,540 --> 00:15:32,110
Like you don't want a big open bucket because say you come here and you get your clean water if you have a big open bucket,

142
00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:36,700
well, stuff is going to fall into it. On the way back when I was when I was working in Coxes,

143
00:15:36,700 --> 00:15:44,620
I would see people leave out the buckets full for game collection and then you'd see a chicken come along and defecate into it or something like that.

144
00:15:44,620 --> 00:15:48,220
So you want to make sure they have a small opening and that they're close about.

145
00:15:49,660 --> 00:15:53,709
You also want to think about how easy and convenient the distribution points are.

146
00:15:53,710 --> 00:15:57,400
They need to be close enough to people's homes that they can get that easily

147
00:15:57,400 --> 00:16:02,800
and that they aren't really putting off this water journey and picking less,

148
00:16:04,060 --> 00:16:09,520
less difficult options which might not be as safe.

149
00:16:10,110 --> 00:16:15,999
Also costs. What's the what's the cheapest way of being able to program often in place you work and it might not be

150
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:20,560
any what in your bias you have to figure out a way to chuck it in a pipe window or do something else.

151
00:16:21,160 --> 00:16:25,299
Household water storage is also quite important how a household storing the water is important.

152
00:16:25,300 --> 00:16:26,800
They have good containers at home too.

153
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:33,220
So that water and also the environmental impact, especially if you're doing a bottled water distribution program,

154
00:16:33,220 --> 00:16:37,150
you want to make sure your your impact on the environment as little as possible.

155
00:16:39,160 --> 00:16:46,690
We're going I'm going to move on to citation interventions. This diagram is not a joke at all called a [INAUDIBLE] flow diagram.

156
00:16:47,020 --> 00:16:50,800
You'll be at a conference and some be talking and they'll be like, This is my [INAUDIBLE] flow diagram.

157
00:16:51,550 --> 00:17:05,120
Nobody was called that, but it's great. And what this shows is how feces goes from the sewer all the way into being reused or disposed of.

158
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:09,940
And it goes from containing the feces to making sure it's you know,

159
00:17:09,940 --> 00:17:15,549
it comes from the person it in the sewer and doesn't get lost over there that it's some somehow,

160
00:17:15,550 --> 00:17:21,580
you know, if it's if it's not being piped directly that's emptied into somewhere safely

161
00:17:22,420 --> 00:17:26,110
and then transported properly and treated properly and then reused properly.

162
00:17:26,620 --> 00:17:34,839
But what it shows, it's quite important is where the failure happens. For example, over here, this is where some waste is not safely emptied.

163
00:17:34,840 --> 00:17:39,489
So quite a bit is going into residential environment. This is where some safe is being illegally dumped.

164
00:17:39,490 --> 00:17:43,030
So it goes into the drainage system or is not properly treated.

165
00:17:45,110 --> 00:17:50,569
Oh, it's oh, and it goes on receiving water. And so these are diagrams.

166
00:17:50,570 --> 00:17:57,320
If you ever want to go into sanitation interventions, especially sanitation, intervention, engineering, you'll be looking at quite often.

167
00:17:58,590 --> 00:18:02,850
So there are a few different types of latrines. And again, we won't talk about all of them, but we'll touch on the main ones.

168
00:18:03,480 --> 00:18:06,540
The first, which isn't quite latrine but important to know about,

169
00:18:06,750 --> 00:18:11,700
is an open defecation field, a picture of a hill, and it's literally what it sounds like.

170
00:18:11,700 --> 00:18:20,999
It is an open defecation field. You would only ever use these as a wash intervention and the most in the most pressing emerging environment.

171
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:26,160
But there's no other option. And you want to get make sure you're getting away from this as quickly as possible.

172
00:18:26,520 --> 00:18:32,219
The other thing to keep in mind, though, is if you if you go to a community and you do want to build latrines or some

173
00:18:32,220 --> 00:18:36,990
kind of intervention where they in the past and using open defecation fields,

174
00:18:37,530 --> 00:18:45,270
if you build an intervention which is not acceptable to them, which can be for many reasons, they're going to go back to using open defecation.

175
00:18:45,690 --> 00:18:49,049
In fact, back here, I think you can see some latrines.

176
00:18:49,050 --> 00:18:57,540
It's nobody's using. Then there's a communal trench, which again, is which is a bit of a step up from the open defecation field.

177
00:18:57,840 --> 00:19:07,350
So that's having a big trench with cubicles all down, which people then defecate into, which is a step up.

178
00:19:07,350 --> 00:19:12,210
But the issue is disturbing to flies, and that's one big trench in an empty it becomes an issue.

179
00:19:12,990 --> 00:19:19,290
You have a good latrine, which is a single pit for a single latrine, which is a bit better as well, especially if you constructed properly.

180
00:19:19,290 --> 00:19:23,189
So you can make sure it's well and well ventilated.

181
00:19:23,190 --> 00:19:25,440
So flies and those kind of things don't go in now.

182
00:19:26,580 --> 00:19:32,730
And then finally, which is pretty much as bad, if honestly, not worse, an open defecation field as to how you treat.

183
00:19:33,210 --> 00:19:37,500
This is the pretty classic picture to show, you know, failures in Wash.

184
00:19:38,070 --> 00:19:41,070
These are children playing in the water. This is the hanging latrine.

185
00:19:41,190 --> 00:19:47,880
And this is a man. And you can I don't need to explain what's going on over here and why it's an issue.

186
00:19:48,360 --> 00:19:56,460
And then you have all types of other toilets. You have compost toilets and septic toilets and sewage toilets, which are all these two in Michigan.

187
00:19:58,590 --> 00:20:00,220
We now going to talk a little bit more.

188
00:20:00,490 --> 00:20:07,320
So just going back to when we talk about the pit latrine and the transitory and different types of ones like those.

189
00:20:07,890 --> 00:20:11,710
These got to go and somebody needs to empty them on the ground.

190
00:20:11,730 --> 00:20:15,840
Over here, we have somebody whose job it is to empty one of the pit latrines.

191
00:20:16,200 --> 00:20:19,679
I was I didn't find a video on that one because they're quite graphic.

192
00:20:19,680 --> 00:20:29,370
But here's a video on people emptying pit latrines that have that are primarily pits that are primarily used for garbage disposal in India.

193
00:20:36,020 --> 00:20:41,290
Bundled telephone calls are coming with ongoing legal.

194
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:56,520
But while they're not there, though, they're.

195
00:20:57,770 --> 00:21:14,680
GI be gi be telling quick omg yeah I'm going to give you a little bit of that oil and then he got to give it to me or I won't let.

196
00:21:16,630 --> 00:21:22,620
Now. I don't know whether I want to live better, but on a higher level.

197
00:21:23,040 --> 00:21:26,540
So I don't want that of.

198
00:21:32,790 --> 00:21:37,440
But what about the fact that.

199
00:21:39,750 --> 00:21:43,830
You ever wanted to be a baby?

200
00:21:45,150 --> 00:21:53,030
When I die. Some time ago.

201
00:21:53,130 --> 00:21:57,650
I'm going to get you guys up for your bags of questions about having to do with jewelry that they had.

202
00:21:57,720 --> 00:22:12,450
I've got a look on them. I've never let them know that that's a valuable topic.

203
00:22:12,460 --> 00:22:18,100
The part that finally get to them. I'm willing to finally give it everything.

204
00:22:18,100 --> 00:22:24,590
And finally I got opening up up them about how building a lot of them are doing better than they.

205
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:39,790
But they've even got a government, which we. This is a monolith.

206
00:22:46,090 --> 00:22:54,240
Because there be upheaval. But a lot of people.

207
00:22:59,420 --> 00:23:05,590
In the battle of old guys and a comet in almost 6 minutes.

208
00:23:05,960 --> 00:23:09,140
You gotta go for it. Got to put it. I got them.

209
00:23:09,160 --> 00:23:14,160
I got. So.

210
00:23:16,500 --> 00:23:21,920
Pitt MP is a really big concern when it comes to global health, especially water, sanitation,

211
00:23:21,930 --> 00:23:29,459
hygiene, because there are always two empty pits without using pit empty as such as you know,

212
00:23:29,460 --> 00:23:36,810
they have vacuum trucks similar to the way you accident septic tank and those other things you can do like if

213
00:23:36,810 --> 00:23:42,420
you're having a pit latrine having two pits and that way by the time one pig gets food and use the other one,

214
00:23:42,430 --> 00:23:51,169
then the other one to decompose. But looking at the health of pedometers and trying to improve that through vaccination,

215
00:23:51,170 --> 00:23:54,969
then prophylaxis, not interventions, is a really emerging health topic.

216
00:23:54,970 --> 00:24:02,020
And as you know, people and stress is really one you should be looking into because work on this topic is really urgently needed.

217
00:24:04,050 --> 00:24:08,280
And an environmental sanitation hygiene. So how do we clean up garbage in the environment?

218
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:16,080
And there are quite a few ways doing this. So you can have a landfill, you can incinerate, you can recycle.

219
00:24:16,590 --> 00:24:17,249
Before all these,

220
00:24:17,250 --> 00:24:25,020
you really have to consider back to control and the environmental impact of a rat so that as a breeding ground for flies and whatever else.

221
00:24:25,290 --> 00:24:28,650
And because of this, you really have to consider where you're going to put these.

222
00:24:28,710 --> 00:24:36,330
And you find almost a sweet spot, one that's not too far away from communities such that it's just kind of useless and accessible.

223
00:24:36,540 --> 00:24:42,450
But sametime so close that the vectors that have bred over there have an impact on communities.

224
00:24:43,980 --> 00:24:48,870
You also need to consider the infrastructure needs.

225
00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:52,590
So what do you need for these facilities? Can you afford it?

226
00:24:52,860 --> 00:24:57,389
And also, how often do you want them to be used? Is this something which is going to be used once?

227
00:24:57,390 --> 00:25:01,950
Is something that's going to be used for a long time, forever, but really depends on the context.

228
00:25:04,150 --> 00:25:11,470
And personal hygiene is a building showers and building and building hand-washing stations.

229
00:25:11,710 --> 00:25:18,260
One of the best ways to build a handwashing station where you actually don't need any soap is to have pretty heavily chlorinated water.

230
00:25:18,280 --> 00:25:22,750
Of course, water heavy elimination is, you know, just so a fraction of a percent.

231
00:25:23,080 --> 00:25:27,610
But having chlorinated water, we would wash our hands and also eliminates the need for soap.

232
00:25:29,170 --> 00:25:33,579
And often these these hand-washing stations don't need to be extremely fancy.

233
00:25:33,580 --> 00:25:41,080
Of course, you can have nicer ones here with buttocks and back thing, but this is one that works really well,

234
00:25:41,110 --> 00:25:49,599
which is pretty much standard Jerry Camp to to this little stick structure here and then having a rope down there where you can just tip it over.

235
00:25:49,600 --> 00:25:57,879
It's got a tip top, tip it over and wash your hands and then showers as well, or having at least some place that people can bed,

236
00:25:57,880 --> 00:26:02,710
even if it's not a proper shower where they can just bring up, bring some water into and bathe that.

237
00:26:03,940 --> 00:26:08,600
But it's also important to consider as well cultural norms.

238
00:26:08,660 --> 00:26:13,420
You need to separate bathing environments by gender which which you talk about.

239
00:26:13,420 --> 00:26:19,270
Second often is this viscose norms a good thing to do? And also, you know, what kind of soap is acceptable?

240
00:26:19,270 --> 00:26:24,310
Do you need to dispel, dispel beliefs around washing with mother, those kind of things.

241
00:26:24,670 --> 00:26:29,140
And also something which with which I found out, you know,

242
00:26:30,390 --> 00:26:37,780
it wasn't expected to find out when I was doing some work in Malaysia was a lot of people actually want you want to use alcohol based hand sanitizer,

243
00:26:38,080 --> 00:26:41,200
so you shouldn't have that as your main means of hand-washing.

244
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:45,130
You might need to have that as well as soap and water or chlorinated water.

245
00:26:46,660 --> 00:26:48,830
There are few other things to consider in wash as well.

246
00:26:48,850 --> 00:26:58,179
The first is food hygiene, so making sure food is stored safely and cooked properly and then stored safely again or cooked if it's being kept in.

247
00:26:58,180 --> 00:27:05,230
That can be done for refrigeration or other means of preserving food as well.

248
00:27:05,560 --> 00:27:12,670
Also, education. A big part of wash is behavior change and making sure people know how to keep the water safe,

249
00:27:12,670 --> 00:27:17,980
how to be sanitary, and how to practice good hygiene and also monitoring and evaluation.

250
00:27:19,820 --> 00:27:24,530
If you as people, as all of you, most of you having a general MPH,

251
00:27:25,280 --> 00:27:32,900
a good career path go down this monitoring and evaluation career path the monitoring and in what interventions is difficult.

252
00:27:34,060 --> 00:27:46,310
I'll take for example, a, let's say hypothetically a water chlorination intervention to decrease infant deaths from diarrhea.

253
00:27:46,580 --> 00:27:53,790
So how are we going to monitor and evaluate that? Well, you can ask people all you want to, but they might lie.

254
00:27:55,020 --> 00:28:01,829
And that's very you know, that's that's not the final thing in that cycle, in that scene that we talked about.

255
00:28:01,830 --> 00:28:05,670
So then we could go measure water for chlorine. But that's great.

256
00:28:05,670 --> 00:28:11,010
And that's a better indication of chlorination. But do we know if that's impacting diarrhea and under-five?

257
00:28:11,010 --> 00:28:15,270
That's well, then we can ask parents, has your child had diarrhea?

258
00:28:16,410 --> 00:28:19,979
I can share a paper with you all, which I wrote a few years ago.

259
00:28:19,980 --> 00:28:24,480
And it turns out parents actually have no idea if their child had diarrhea or not.

260
00:28:24,780 --> 00:28:32,490
So then you can say, and that's because they might for guess they might not understand what diarrhea is or a bunch of other reasons.

261
00:28:33,300 --> 00:28:39,540
And then you can say, okay, we're going to collect stool samples and see if see if it's looser, watery.

262
00:28:40,290 --> 00:28:44,659
Well, then why is it loose, watery? It could well be because of internal pathogens and water.

263
00:28:44,660 --> 00:28:48,870
It could because of nutrition or could be because of stress.

264
00:28:49,110 --> 00:28:53,070
On the flip side, it could be solid even, but they have an asymptomatic infection.

265
00:28:53,610 --> 00:28:59,040
So you need to think about all these things and monitoring, evaluate interventions and not have too many assumptions in there.

266
00:28:59,730 --> 00:29:07,140
And this is the case for all public health interventions, but especially for wash interventions, because you have so many assumptions in that.

267
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:14,300
And gender based violence and what gender based violence and what really go hand in hand.

268
00:29:15,020 --> 00:29:19,520
And and it's such a complex topic. There are a lot of things which feed into gender based violence.

269
00:29:19,520 --> 00:29:27,020
Obviously, there's a socio cultural norms, also cultural issues like gender roles, social norms and inequality.

270
00:29:27,620 --> 00:29:32,089
Then you have the environmental factors which which I think are the biggest ones,

271
00:29:32,090 --> 00:29:36,550
at least when it comes to wash, when it comes to in general, social cultures.

272
00:29:36,890 --> 00:29:41,270
Social, cultural is big one, but wash environmental is the ones you can really impact.

273
00:29:41,570 --> 00:29:47,990
So how far away are the wash facilities women are using?

274
00:29:47,990 --> 00:29:53,750
Are they too far away that they that the issues on the way they they close enough to home that they feel safe going there

275
00:29:54,110 --> 00:30:00,229
also even if it is close to home where is it isn't still in like a back alley somewhere around a dark place or in place.

276
00:30:00,230 --> 00:30:05,390
People as dangerous as in a well-lit place and as the security around them, people who they trust.

277
00:30:06,320 --> 00:30:16,459
And also what's a neighborhood generally like, a big intervention to decrease decrease ggb for WASIL, these is it's very simple.

278
00:30:16,460 --> 00:30:22,940
It's just putting lights around latrines and showers and that that cuts down on GBV quite a bit.

279
00:30:25,090 --> 00:30:30,880
On the flip side, however, if you don't do that and women don't feel safe, it happens quite often is they don't use washed so easily.

280
00:30:31,040 --> 00:30:38,710
They'll defecate in the home or or they'll try to wash themselves in the home, which causes, you know, increased risk of infection.

281
00:30:39,040 --> 00:30:45,010
And finally, when you consider the structural factors like policy and power and how is the infrastructure designed?

282
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:47,800
Is it designed in a way that.

283
00:30:49,570 --> 00:30:57,790
That, for example, people can look in or, you know, people can see using it all is designed in such a way that there's some privacy over that.

284
00:31:00,040 --> 00:31:05,409
And then it's and then it goes down to all different types of gender based violence with a structure of physical,

285
00:31:05,410 --> 00:31:12,100
psychological or sexual, which has really big health impacts and psychological impacts as well.

286
00:31:13,670 --> 00:31:19,220
And finally, menstrual hygiene. And I won't speak too much on this because you all what's the documentary on it

287
00:31:19,760 --> 00:31:25,549
but I'll look up left we have a graph from Kenya from rural Kenya showing what

288
00:31:25,550 --> 00:31:32,510
menstrual hygiene products women in a survey in 2015 use and not an insignificant

289
00:31:32,510 --> 00:31:40,190
number are using products which you would which you would say aren't very good.

290
00:31:40,550 --> 00:31:48,940
For example, about 8% are using mud, a cow dung, a leaves, which really increases the chance infection, even the other ones.

291
00:31:48,950 --> 00:31:54,979
Toilet paper isn't as absorbent as you would like and as well as cloth.

292
00:31:54,980 --> 00:32:04,190
And not many are using tampons or I'm not sure what they mean by cotton, but it's press cotton tab the pad which was in which is in documentary.

293
00:32:04,190 --> 00:32:05,270
Oh, even menstrual cups.

294
00:32:05,570 --> 00:32:16,130
Menstrual cups are actually a really promising menstrual hygiene intervention which has been coming out in quite a few countries,

295
00:32:16,970 --> 00:32:22,400
particularly in Southern Africa, because they're reusable, they can be washed, they're fairly sanitary.

296
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:26,720
And if you do it properly, similarly to what was what we saw in the document,

297
00:32:26,730 --> 00:32:32,990
you can actually improve markets and create a market for for menstrual products.

298
00:32:33,740 --> 00:32:38,180
I'm sure most people have heard of these menstruation huts on the ground,

299
00:32:38,180 --> 00:32:41,540
but this happens in quite a few countries where women, when they're menstruating,

300
00:32:41,540 --> 00:32:47,269
will be told to go to these huts to to just finish menstruating over there because

301
00:32:47,270 --> 00:32:50,840
they see it as unclean and people don't want them in the house or in society.

302
00:32:51,140 --> 00:32:55,580
And this really has pretty major impacts on women's health.

303
00:32:55,580 --> 00:33:02,480
For example, education. Women can miss up to 20% of school days when when growing up because of menstruation.

304
00:33:02,510 --> 00:33:06,950
Also similarly with missing work and having decreased economic output with health.

305
00:33:08,620 --> 00:33:13,120
Inadequate mental hygiene has been linked to gender based violence and also infections.

306
00:33:13,870 --> 00:33:22,579
Using reusable absorbent materials, for example, for some not using disposable pads or tampons, but reusable cloth.

307
00:33:22,580 --> 00:33:26,350
And those complaints can increase the chance of infection by about 54%.

308
00:33:26,710 --> 00:33:32,860
And, of course, the massive psychological impacts that comes with the shaming and exclusion from society.

309
00:33:34,920 --> 00:33:38,240
So we'll now pause. Two questions if there are any.

310
00:33:38,250 --> 00:33:42,330
And if not, we will move into the jam board and discussion.

311
00:33:49,430 --> 00:33:52,850
I think we could them to jump in. If you could help us with the groups, please.

312
00:34:23,550 --> 00:34:27,270
So we will, as always, go through each group to present.

313
00:34:28,560 --> 00:34:32,490
So I would just share my screen and then we can go to the jam board.

314
00:34:34,730 --> 00:34:38,250
I don't look at my flight bookings. There we go.

315
00:34:39,650 --> 00:34:42,740
So group number four, would you like to go first?

316
00:34:50,750 --> 00:34:57,220
Sorry. I forgot that we were group number four. I can speak a little bit about what we talked about.

317
00:34:57,230 --> 00:35:05,910
So our context was menstrual hygiene, hygiene in India, internally displaced persons in Burma.

318
00:35:05,930 --> 00:35:12,380
Landler So in 2021, civil war broke out in Myanmar.

319
00:35:13,370 --> 00:35:16,830
I'm not sure exactly what the two groups are like a military coup. And I'm assuming.

320
00:35:20,190 --> 00:35:23,670
The existing government or other under instance groups.

321
00:35:24,030 --> 00:35:33,660
Either way, that left many folks internally displaced as they're trying to avoid violence from the conflict.

322
00:35:34,830 --> 00:35:39,030
As a result, a lot of women are lacking access to menstrual hygiene,

323
00:35:39,030 --> 00:35:48,390
hygiene products and private places to change those products and wash themselves as well.

324
00:35:49,710 --> 00:35:59,400
As a result, minute like one of the one of the facts in my article is that like many women would use one pad like they an

325
00:35:59,400 --> 00:36:06,750
evening and this increases the risk of infection because you're not changing it as frequently as might be required.

326
00:36:08,340 --> 00:36:21,540
And there's also concern about changing products in front of the men and refugee camps, the conflict in the country as well,

327
00:36:21,540 --> 00:36:31,850
and just being an internally displaced person without access to perhaps the products that they may have had access to before.

328
00:36:31,860 --> 00:36:40,560
Conflict has really limited the products available to these IDPs, partly because the.

329
00:36:42,770 --> 00:36:44,179
One of the signs, I don't remember,

330
00:36:44,180 --> 00:36:53,360
which is intentionally restricting trade of certain products and included in that would be menstrual hygiene hygiene products.

331
00:36:54,770 --> 00:36:59,130
Let's see what else? Oh, yeah.

332
00:36:59,140 --> 00:37:06,310
I mean, the important note is that some people might be because they're internally displaced folks, they might be on the move constantly.

333
00:37:06,310 --> 00:37:07,690
I know the article mentioned that.

334
00:37:09,660 --> 00:37:21,030
Oftentimes civilians are forced to hide away in certain, presumably safer areas to avoid conflict in the woods for long periods of time.

335
00:37:21,390 --> 00:37:25,110
And that clearly limits access to certain products when needed.

336
00:37:25,920 --> 00:37:34,050
We spent a good amount of time looking and thinking about proposed interventions, the last time thinking about how we monitor those interventions.

337
00:37:34,060 --> 00:37:38,130
As we discussed, it's kind of hard to come up with monitoring systems.

338
00:37:39,120 --> 00:37:44,280
So some of our proposed interventions would be, as Dr. Reagan mentioned,

339
00:37:44,700 --> 00:37:53,040
perhaps creating sort of a discreet line to corner stores if they're available to allow women to access contraceptives discreetly.

340
00:37:53,520 --> 00:37:57,690
This can certainly help with like menstrual symptoms and severity.

341
00:37:58,530 --> 00:38:02,690
Perhaps that can also that there can still be like a straight line for products of products are available.

342
00:38:02,700 --> 00:38:09,750
But again, availability is an issue in this context. We also want to ensure that folks have.

343
00:38:11,190 --> 00:38:25,260
As I say. Oh, there are some folks in these contexts that are looking to secure menstrual hygiene products for men, strangers with them.

344
00:38:27,770 --> 00:38:37,160
Within the IDPs, and they're often placed at increased risk of violence because they are trying to avoid the violence from the armed military groups.

345
00:38:37,550 --> 00:38:42,620
So we would ask for some sort of safety to be ensured for those folks.

346
00:38:42,980 --> 00:38:49,910
We also thought that maybe a good intervention would be to set up sort of like privacy tents, sort of like what, you know,

347
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:53,830
if you were to host a photoshoot, not to make it sound trivial,

348
00:38:53,840 --> 00:38:59,210
but then you wanted to change your outfit in the middle of the photoshoot or something.

349
00:38:59,220 --> 00:39:03,920
Usually there's some sort of privacy tent in which someone can change discreetly,

350
00:39:03,920 --> 00:39:09,590
and we would apply this sort of same logic to allow women to wash themselves.

351
00:39:11,840 --> 00:39:15,200
While they're on the move, essentially as things.

352
00:39:15,860 --> 00:39:22,129
And then our last point was that we would like to increase for those living in the refugee camps.

353
00:39:22,130 --> 00:39:30,440
We'd like to increase the female presence and leadership so that women can feel more comfortable seeking and asking for their needs to be met.

354
00:39:31,520 --> 00:39:36,260
Monitoring interventions. Like I said, we didn't really get to as much, but we're hoping that maybe like.

355
00:39:37,540 --> 00:39:47,730
We could follow up with. Fill up with questionnaires to sort of get an idea of how the interventions are working for everyone.

356
00:39:52,340 --> 00:39:57,170
Great. Yeah, a lot of great things over here and the interventions are really interesting,

357
00:39:58,100 --> 00:40:08,840
especially the privacy tends to one thing I would mention that those need to make sure that they're done in a way that they don't become like the the,

358
00:40:09,440 --> 00:40:15,469
the menstrual hygiene tents. They're just kind of general tents that people can then use for other reasons.

359
00:40:15,470 --> 00:40:21,500
And then, you know, it's it's a it's a difficult one because you want to make sure menstruating women know that they can wash themselves.

360
00:40:21,500 --> 00:40:25,310
And and that's what that meant. For the same time, you don't want it to become another menstrual hut.

361
00:40:26,660 --> 00:40:28,220
So it's it's a difficult balance,

362
00:40:29,870 --> 00:40:35,720
but you really need a lot of community engagement work with community health workers that you female community health workers to get the word out.

363
00:40:36,620 --> 00:40:41,720
The model of interventions, questionnaires and observations are always good,

364
00:40:42,260 --> 00:40:49,190
but you need to realize when you think about, you know, that might be reasons why people might not want to leave those.

365
00:40:50,270 --> 00:40:57,100
You know, one big one is social desirability bias where, you know, they might just answer you,

366
00:40:57,130 --> 00:41:01,100
you know, they might say, no, I don't I don't use menstrual hygiene supplies.

367
00:41:01,100 --> 00:41:07,610
Some of that, even though they do because because there's still might be a taboo against using them or or because of,

368
00:41:07,610 --> 00:41:10,910
you know, they fear persecution if they do.

369
00:41:11,300 --> 00:41:16,160
Or they might answer the opposite way for a bunch of other reasons nephew ways around that.

370
00:41:16,160 --> 00:41:23,690
But one way which works very well, especially from from moving populations, is using mobile phone surveying.

371
00:41:23,690 --> 00:41:28,549
So try to register people, get their mobile phones, then you can just send them a text message saying,

372
00:41:28,550 --> 00:41:32,360
hey, have you, you know, are you making use of these facilities?

373
00:41:32,360 --> 00:41:36,290
And there's generally a lot more privacy when you do that.

374
00:41:37,370 --> 00:41:42,470
Create any any comments for this group and closing comments from the group, any questions for them?

375
00:41:46,110 --> 00:41:51,360
Wonderful. Let's now move on to group number three who is looking at four coma in Senegal.

376
00:41:52,560 --> 00:41:56,090
Yeah. So we kind of do like a divide and conquer method here.

377
00:41:56,100 --> 00:41:59,460
So I think we're each kind of like take little turns, kind of extending our boxes.

378
00:41:59,910 --> 00:42:07,260
So as responsible for history and social context. And so it's kind of looked at a couple of studies and there are a few from 1997 where

379
00:42:07,260 --> 00:42:10,410
they found that trachoma in Senegal was the second leading cause of blindness.

380
00:42:10,710 --> 00:42:19,050
So they started all these roll out studies, including antibiotic dosing through a zoo through Meissen, and this was employed through the SAFE Program,

381
00:42:19,050 --> 00:42:26,700
which is like a program specifically geared towards treatments of like environmental factors, hand hygiene and antibiotics for trachoma.

382
00:42:28,020 --> 00:42:33,930
And this was primarily led by Pfizer since they were doing this trachoma initiative, I think in beginning 1998,

383
00:42:34,230 --> 00:42:39,300
where they were supplying the proper antibiotics to Senegal to kind of get this infection under control.

384
00:42:40,110 --> 00:42:45,179
But there's all there's kind of a variation in prevalence between communities because maybe some weren't getting access to the medicine,

385
00:42:45,180 --> 00:42:51,810
as were others. So reinfection events were occurring from untreated communities and spreading to those who had been treated.

386
00:42:52,200 --> 00:43:00,509
So looking further into it, I think the most recent study I was looking at was a couple years ago and they said that in the Globe

387
00:43:00,510 --> 00:43:05,970
currently there are 200 million people who are at risk and 1.9 million people are already blind from trachoma.

388
00:43:06,360 --> 00:43:16,590
Therefore, the WHO has launched this Who alliance call to get 2020, which is basically this push for the elimination of trachoma from Senegal by 2020.

389
00:43:16,860 --> 00:43:22,050
And a couple of ways of doing this are also just employing more kind of antibiotic mass drug administrations.

390
00:43:22,710 --> 00:43:25,890
And they do this a lot for children because it primarily affects children.

391
00:43:25,890 --> 00:43:33,570
So they really want to try and intercept transmission there. So they now recommend doing annual antibiotics for three years.

392
00:43:33,840 --> 00:43:38,280
And then upon like any kind of like breaks and sanitation won't be necessary.

393
00:43:38,640 --> 00:43:44,670
But socially speaking, upon recurrent events, you can have like eventually like eyelid,

394
00:43:44,670 --> 00:43:49,530
disfiguration, and it can cause a lot of isolation for those who are affected.

395
00:43:50,370 --> 00:43:52,589
They also become an economic burden on individuals.

396
00:43:52,590 --> 00:43:58,079
So we watched the video as a group and they just mentioned that they're unable to really work on their own.

397
00:43:58,080 --> 00:44:04,020
And children specifically are seen as a burden because they aren't really able to care for themselves or be productive on their own as a society.

398
00:44:04,350 --> 00:44:07,470
So interventions would be greatly appreciated for them.

399
00:44:12,320 --> 00:44:17,270
Okay. I did. The issue itself, that section and it's a bacterial infection.

400
00:44:17,270 --> 00:44:29,929
Trachoma is a bacterial infection. And the main way to avoid this infection or to avoid further infection is by regularly washing your eyes.

401
00:44:29,930 --> 00:44:34,579
But this requires clean water and clean water access in order to do that.

402
00:44:34,580 --> 00:44:37,459
And so repeated infection is really in common.

403
00:44:37,460 --> 00:44:44,960
And that's when you get the scarring, which sort of turns your lashes inward, and that's what causes blindness.

404
00:44:44,960 --> 00:44:49,850
So the leading intervention is surgery.

405
00:44:49,850 --> 00:44:54,629
And so the surgical intervention, if I believe they in the video,

406
00:44:54,630 --> 00:45:01,670
it shows that they cut a slit in your scarred eyelid and are able to turn your lashes away from your eye.

407
00:45:01,670 --> 00:45:09,700
And that is able to at some stage reverse some of the ill effects of that scarring.

408
00:45:09,710 --> 00:45:17,720
And they said in the video that a lot of these people who are performing this surgery aren't necessarily doctors or medically trained,

409
00:45:17,720 --> 00:45:26,090
but they have been trained by the World Health Organization as clinical staff so that more people have access to the surgical intervention.

410
00:45:28,150 --> 00:45:31,250
I saw that, especially during COVID 19.

411
00:45:31,270 --> 00:45:39,280
These, like few trained clinical staff were not able to access all of the communities that needed the surgical intervention.

412
00:45:39,280 --> 00:45:42,250
So that's one way that COVID currently is affecting this issue.

413
00:45:48,420 --> 00:45:53,550
So I decided to propose intervention, one of the first in the book about this education.

414
00:45:53,880 --> 00:45:59,760
So teaching people do not use dirty hands in their eyes, not using contaminated water on your face.

415
00:46:00,180 --> 00:46:09,149
And also another one is safe, which means like surgery, for instance, disease antibodies to clear, to combat infection, vicious.

416
00:46:09,150 --> 00:46:13,740
And in this environment, they'll improvement to reduce transmission to the eyes.

417
00:46:14,310 --> 00:46:24,570
And one other intervention is the Guinea worm intervention, which was an existing intervention that have been used to fight against Guinea worm.

418
00:46:26,280 --> 00:46:40,740
The defense. Yes, there are added strategies to monitor these interventions and kind of along the lines of what Emira was saying.

419
00:46:41,850 --> 00:46:49,560
There's some attempts to use strategies from the Guinea worm eradication program for trachoma,

420
00:46:49,860 --> 00:46:53,819
and something that I thought was interesting that I read in that same article that

421
00:46:53,820 --> 00:47:02,220
talked about that was using monitor reward for identification and report of cases.

422
00:47:02,910 --> 00:47:07,020
I guess that that's something that's been really successful in the Guinea worm program.

423
00:47:07,020 --> 00:47:12,690
But a caveat that they specified is that these diagnoses need to be coming from trained professionals.

424
00:47:12,930 --> 00:47:21,990
They had said in that article, and something I read in another article about trachoma is that people are like kind of self diagnosing, I guess.

425
00:47:22,890 --> 00:47:30,600
And so like, there's like questions about the validity of some reports of cases of trachoma.

426
00:47:31,710 --> 00:47:38,730
The recommendation was also that when it came to data collection, that that happened on like a village based or community based level.

427
00:47:40,840 --> 00:47:43,840
Versus maybe like, you know, larger scale.

428
00:47:44,890 --> 00:47:51,790
And to follow up and to assess the success of the safe strategies for the first two,

429
00:47:52,150 --> 00:47:58,660
that's surgical and antibiotic use to follow up with people following their treatments.

430
00:47:59,050 --> 00:48:05,220
And then for the second to for facial cleanliness and environmental improvement to use like

431
00:48:05,260 --> 00:48:11,580
survey and interview data to kind of check what people's behaviors in that room so that.

432
00:48:13,520 --> 00:48:20,240
It's all great stuff. You actually comment on two of the intervention monitoring things you mentioned.

433
00:48:20,570 --> 00:48:23,630
The first was the monetary reward,

434
00:48:24,440 --> 00:48:31,340
and I like that you mention has to be from somebody who's diagnosing it because a lot of times it's actually happened with Legacy.

435
00:48:31,610 --> 00:48:35,269
What they would do is it was community based case funding.

436
00:48:35,270 --> 00:48:39,409
So for leprosy, for example, there was a seniors out in India, in Nepal,

437
00:48:39,410 --> 00:48:44,760
and they had posters saying if you reported somebody with leprosy in your community, you'd get in the wall.

438
00:48:44,780 --> 00:48:53,840
Those ended up being people would go and look for people that looked at to see just so they can report them and find and find and get the reward.

439
00:48:55,640 --> 00:48:59,840
And then you mentioned surveys to look at facial cleanliness.

440
00:49:00,050 --> 00:49:03,260
A great way to look at facial cleanliness, actually, which has done quite a bit,

441
00:49:03,500 --> 00:49:06,889
is you take like a little bit of clean gauze and you get something like wipe it

442
00:49:06,890 --> 00:49:11,150
on their face and you can use it on hands as well to look at hand cleanliness.

443
00:49:11,390 --> 00:49:17,390
And then you look at how much dirt is on that gauze and compare it to, you know, like a scale from like,

444
00:49:17,390 --> 00:49:24,920
you know, pristine, clean white gauze to being quite dirty, which is another good way of doing that.

445
00:49:24,920 --> 00:49:30,410
So great work there. Group number two GBE and Wash and the DOB Kenya.

446
00:49:33,130 --> 00:49:38,670
Yeah. So we did gender based violence wash in the dog Kenya.

447
00:49:38,680 --> 00:49:47,380
So Dadaab, Kenya, as originally established in 1994 for Somalis that were fleeing there, were fleeing the Somalia civil war.

448
00:49:48,460 --> 00:50:00,550
It's a refugee complex that has about 200 218,873 registered refugees in the asylum seekers as of July 2020.

449
00:50:01,600 --> 00:50:05,860
So within the within the complex,

450
00:50:06,490 --> 00:50:18,219
it was reported that 60.3% of women had experienced non partner violence and 66.7 had experienced intimate partner violence within the complex.

451
00:50:18,220 --> 00:50:26,470
And that the that one in three GB caseworkers had experienced non partner violence in the last 12 months.

452
00:50:27,670 --> 00:50:36,459
So as far as the issues go with wash so I had found information that the latrines in the

453
00:50:36,460 --> 00:50:43,450
area that were better in the yellow latrines are an area and they were often poorly lit.

454
00:50:43,870 --> 00:50:49,210
They weren't separated by gender. I mean, they didn't have locks on them.

455
00:50:49,220 --> 00:50:54,430
So that left a lot of women vulnerable to sexual assault.

456
00:50:55,450 --> 00:51:02,400
Additionally, it was Christian had also mentioned that there were there was a running theme of

457
00:51:02,410 --> 00:51:08,050
like poorly of just the areas being poorly lit that left women very vulnerable.

458
00:51:09,220 --> 00:51:14,440
And also a lot of women would feel pressured to part with utility water utility

459
00:51:14,440 --> 00:51:20,620
workers to prevent their water connections getting off in places like Kenya,

460
00:51:20,620 --> 00:51:24,820
but also in like South America or excuse me, South Africa and Colombia.

461
00:51:26,170 --> 00:51:34,569
And as far as proposed interventions, so we have there were is better lighting a lot of the wash resources.

462
00:51:34,570 --> 00:51:38,890
There were also the introduction of familiars and hiring of safeguards.

463
00:51:39,310 --> 00:51:44,800
I mean, legislative intervention. And the people who wrote that want to expound on that.

464
00:51:45,370 --> 00:51:52,449
Feel free. Oh, yeah, sure. When you mentioned about like the lighting too was, um, I guess they,

465
00:51:52,450 --> 00:51:57,909
what they realized over time was that when they actually because you were saying

466
00:51:57,910 --> 00:52:02,830
how they had poor lighting and sound and so to remedy that kind of problem,

467
00:52:02,830 --> 00:52:13,530
they introduced some lighting along the area to wash resources that like hand-washing stations or restrooms.

468
00:52:14,290 --> 00:52:16,540
But then they realized over time that, you know,

469
00:52:16,570 --> 00:52:24,310
men would sort of academy in those areas and that kind of didn't remedy the issue for reducing GBV needs in those areas.

470
00:52:24,790 --> 00:52:29,150
So they thought. You know, how do we do that?

471
00:52:29,170 --> 00:52:32,500
Like, how does this kind of reduce this problem?

472
00:52:33,100 --> 00:52:38,800
If anything, it exacerbates it. You know, so it didn't really do anything.

473
00:52:38,830 --> 00:52:45,800
The only way that we can actually make this. Or mitigate this problem is through something like legislative interventions.

474
00:52:46,310 --> 00:52:52,880
But the people who have or are experiencing these issue, these problems, the issues,

475
00:52:53,160 --> 00:53:00,380
this violence kind of in control or in the driver's seat of the ones that are experiencing the violence.

476
00:53:00,530 --> 00:53:11,569
So they thought that an intervention like legislation or some place other than in

477
00:53:11,570 --> 00:53:17,510
the passenger's seat would be a nice way to or an effective way to work around it.

478
00:53:18,440 --> 00:53:23,240
So. And Yeah. For how would you monitor the intervention?

479
00:53:23,260 --> 00:53:36,280
I think we I also found that the Save the Children organization has been doing a rapid assessment reports for a few years now.

480
00:53:36,280 --> 00:53:39,850
And back in, I think 2021 was their most recent one.

481
00:53:40,300 --> 00:53:49,300
And they usually do a gender desk of the top to see cases in that area,

482
00:53:50,230 --> 00:53:57,220
and they constantly report back with gender desks to see the amount of GDP in that area.

483
00:53:58,170 --> 00:54:03,090
So that's how they keep up with monitoring. And I think that that's an effective way to do so.

484
00:54:04,300 --> 00:54:08,560
But yeah, they also do a lot of other interventions like, you know,

485
00:54:09,580 --> 00:54:16,780
keeping children or having children kind of interact with each other from both sides of sexes and,

486
00:54:17,440 --> 00:54:20,980
you know, kind of increasing the capacity of knowledge.

487
00:54:22,020 --> 00:54:29,700
In that area. But that's less more interventions, less more monitor interventions and more operas and interventions.

488
00:54:31,970 --> 00:54:36,870
Say thank you and just in the interest of time. On to group number one stuff.

489
00:54:37,060 --> 00:54:51,900
Put latrines in schools. I can talk about my part briefly, but then I'll have to go because I have to catch a bus.

490
00:54:52,380 --> 00:54:58,410
But I did. The historical and social context of the pit latrines in South Africa.

491
00:54:58,770 --> 00:55:04,440
And essentially like what happened is it's like a legacy of the past in South Africa.

492
00:55:05,340 --> 00:55:11,879
The during that time period, no resources were allocated to develop schools and infrastructure for schools,

493
00:55:11,880 --> 00:55:19,140
for poor predominately black children in those areas. And as such, the latrines are primarily used by those communities.

494
00:55:19,890 --> 00:55:23,219
And as that history has sort of like continued,

495
00:55:23,220 --> 00:55:32,790
there's been a lack of provisioning of resources to modify the existing latrines to being safer as well as when people are modifying them.

496
00:55:32,820 --> 00:55:40,290
There is also a history of underspending and so the amount of resources are not being given that

497
00:55:40,290 --> 00:55:46,800
need to to be to like make these safer or even to like remove them and install proper facilities.

498
00:55:47,280 --> 00:55:50,489
This is also a result of a failure to maintain existing infrastructure.

499
00:55:50,490 --> 00:55:56,069
So when a lot of these were first installed, they were clean and properly built.

500
00:55:56,070 --> 00:56:02,970
And as the years have come by, there's been failure to maintain and they've sort of become these really dangerous places.

501
00:56:04,200 --> 00:56:07,290
So that's the history. If somebody else wants to jump in, I have to run.

502
00:56:08,190 --> 00:56:16,020
Yeah. And so the issue is just over 3000 schools in South Africa still have these poor toilets and children,

503
00:56:16,740 --> 00:56:23,250
just because they're not very secure may not have good material and are oftentimes left and covered, have been falling into them and drowning.

504
00:56:23,910 --> 00:56:32,160
So that's been an issue, an ongoing issue. And then a couple proposed interventions.

505
00:56:32,610 --> 00:56:33,540
First of all,

506
00:56:33,900 --> 00:56:42,750
they got teachers in the schools to start patrolling the toilets and monitoring who goes in and out of them to avoid this incident happening again.

507
00:56:44,160 --> 00:56:53,040
And then, like upgrading the toilets and overall eradicate and eradicating pit latrines because of that danger,

508
00:56:53,910 --> 00:56:59,700
like mobile toilets were brought up for a temporary solution and specific they were in viral

509
00:56:59,700 --> 00:57:07,710
lose their waterless systems that would decompose the wastes more safely than in pit latrines.

510
00:57:08,610 --> 00:57:14,460
But yeah, basically just getting rid of pillar trains and improving that a little bit.

511
00:57:19,720 --> 00:57:26,450
And I just saw Marcus's message that his mic isn't working.

512
00:57:28,100 --> 00:57:35,479
But let's see what he's sent over there from Malta, which is certified that the material used is safe and can help us with having

513
00:57:35,480 --> 00:57:40,370
school attendance sheets and actively monitoring progression of the bathrooms.

514
00:57:40,630 --> 00:57:48,709
But having a public health official engineer a principal present to ensure quality and those are all great ways of monitoring and good interventions.

515
00:57:48,710 --> 00:57:54,380
About to one of the thing to mention as well was these toilets weren't made for schools, they were made for adults.

516
00:57:55,220 --> 00:57:59,000
And these are mostly and in primary schools, elementary school.

517
00:57:59,000 --> 00:58:03,020
So children are able to have a much smaller than adults and they also should have

518
00:58:03,020 --> 00:58:08,290
been made smaller so they didn't have a child sized hole in it as opposed to,

519
00:58:08,300 --> 00:58:12,980
you know, as a whole, which, you know, is appropriate size for a child to use to go to a toilet.

520
00:58:13,340 --> 00:58:17,510
So wonderful. That's all fantastic. So great work on that.

521
00:58:18,920 --> 00:58:26,390
So before we before we I just one thing to mention is we have two empty slots for class in November.

522
00:58:27,830 --> 00:58:32,870
So if you have any topics you would like to see, please let me know and we'll try to fit those in.

523
00:58:33,890 --> 00:58:41,240
And class on Thursday will be on Zoom and we'll be back in person on Tuesday next week, I believe.

524
00:58:42,200 --> 00:58:47,090
So that's all. And looking forward to reading all your papers. Go get those back to you in about two weeks, we think.

525
00:58:49,290 --> 00:58:51,390
But. Grown.
