1
00:00:07,140 --> 00:00:17,090
Thank you. Thank you.

2
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:28,170
Yes. And that's because they think they travel en masse.

3
00:00:34,410 --> 00:00:39,790
Well, I think in every class it happens.

4
00:00:40,070 --> 00:01:01,450
I think it's like coming back to Kenya and India and saying, Oh, that's kind of what I like.

5
00:01:01,530 --> 00:01:10,620
I mean, it's kind of. Something inside.

6
00:01:10,620 --> 00:01:17,370
It's so nice, you know, you're not thinking it's gonna be a family activity.

7
00:01:17,370 --> 00:01:21,250
Everything that's going on in your.

8
00:01:22,980 --> 00:01:37,459
One thing you don't always know, you're a good player, so you needn't worry about having have go and we'll give it another minute or so.

9
00:01:37,460 --> 00:01:42,110
And kids are wandering around the building and the first day I see some more people coming down the hall.

10
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:58,790
And so. So I.

11
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:19,020
It's not just for the. Not so long as I read.

12
00:02:20,890 --> 00:02:23,680
First of all, because have a super exciting time.

13
00:02:26,020 --> 00:02:41,600
Second of all, her meetings are concerned because there was actually even a reason that this is going to affect the other reporters.

14
00:02:43,870 --> 00:02:52,000
Yeah. I think know going to be just as we're.

15
00:02:58,540 --> 00:03:02,300
But it sounds like you say so. Yes. Mean.

16
00:03:02,750 --> 00:03:21,010
That's what I thought. Pretty. There is something he does or does and doesn't get played against us here, she said of the festival.

17
00:03:22,660 --> 00:03:27,270
It's like was her. How.

18
00:03:28,270 --> 00:03:34,340
Yeah. Do it right.

19
00:03:34,940 --> 00:03:39,140
Yeah. No, I hair. Yeah. You know, I got cancer.

20
00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:46,040
I just got kind of a full house. Like the one with the pasta is to supposedly 29.

21
00:03:46,040 --> 00:03:50,149
But we're entertaining our guys.

22
00:03:50,150 --> 00:03:53,210
I think most almost everybody is here now.

23
00:03:53,570 --> 00:03:58,460
Leave that back door open for a bit in case we have some other people filtering in a little bit.

24
00:03:58,550 --> 00:04:07,910
Full House. I'm Ingrid Bergman. I'm your instructor for Toxic 16, which is toxicological pathology.

25
00:04:08,360 --> 00:04:13,820
So I guess we'll get into it in a little bit. For three business, you might be wondering is what in the world is that?

26
00:04:15,890 --> 00:04:20,629
So let's do just a little bit of kind of background and housekeeping stuff.

27
00:04:20,630 --> 00:04:23,990
Introduction to the Class. Just an explanation of how it works.

28
00:04:24,650 --> 00:04:28,400
Hopefully most of you have gotten a chance to look at the canvas site.

29
00:04:29,330 --> 00:04:32,930
If you have any trouble getting on or figuring it out or anything, please let me know.

30
00:04:33,230 --> 00:04:39,139
There are also these handy dandy little help sections if there's something you need to learn about specifically in canvas,

31
00:04:39,140 --> 00:04:45,260
but let me know if you have any difficulty with the site I've been teaching.

32
00:04:45,260 --> 00:04:54,799
This class kind of blows my mind since 2011, so but a couple of times around and classes evolved a little bit and it's always very interesting to me.

33
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:58,250
This is actually the biggest class I've ever taught. So that's great.

34
00:04:58,250 --> 00:05:02,150
And we have people from a pretty broad diversity of backgrounds this year.

35
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:05,959
A lot of times we have more toxicology focus,

36
00:05:05,960 --> 00:05:12,920
but we have people from Environmental Health for bio sat from a lot of programs made up entirely of acronyms.

37
00:05:13,880 --> 00:05:21,350
So it'll be kind of interesting. What's really interesting for me in this class is, you know, I'm a pathologist.

38
00:05:21,350 --> 00:05:27,680
I'll tell you a little bit about my background, but obviously we all come to our field from a certain background and it's really great to

39
00:05:27,740 --> 00:05:31,549
kind of get the input of people maybe coming at it from a slightly different perspective.

40
00:05:31,550 --> 00:05:40,550
So this should be a great semester. We have lots of different perspectives at Clark, so let's do some housekeeping stuff in the morning.

41
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:44,479
Like I said, hopefully you've seen the can.

42
00:05:44,480 --> 00:05:53,990
This site on the home page has a blurb about me for Instructor and it has the course syllabus which will look like look at in a minute.

43
00:05:55,940 --> 00:05:58,370
The basic gist of the class is a big long paragraph,

44
00:05:58,760 --> 00:06:08,959
but the basic gist of the class is to look at how do environmental agents be they infectious agents with natural toxins,

45
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:19,160
be they chemicals that have toxicants, or if there's a nutrient depletion or nutrient access situation, how do those agents make our bodies sick?

46
00:06:19,580 --> 00:06:25,070
And the spine for pathology really is what does that actually look like in the tissues?

47
00:06:25,430 --> 00:06:27,920
So either grossly or microscopically,

48
00:06:28,220 --> 00:06:34,610
and it's intended as kind of a complement to things you might have learned or you might be learning in your toxicology class,

49
00:06:34,910 --> 00:06:39,950
which might focus a little bit more on the chemistry or on the effects of individual cells.

50
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:45,049
We're trying to take it back to our upper level, I'd say, to the cellular or the tissue level,

51
00:06:45,050 --> 00:06:50,660
so that you can integrate those kind of mechanistic pieces of knowledge with what's actually happening in the body.

52
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:53,899
So pathology is a little bit of a holistic view.

53
00:06:53,900 --> 00:07:01,280
Obviously concentrate on an organ system, but pathology is a little bit of a holistic view of toxicology in that it's interested really.

54
00:07:01,910 --> 00:07:03,319
You know, we know all these mechanisms,

55
00:07:03,320 --> 00:07:09,200
but what's happening in the body as a whole and what we'll learn is that even though you can think of an agent,

56
00:07:09,230 --> 00:07:15,980
okay, this is a neurotoxin, this is a renal toxin or a hepatic toxin, the body's an integrated whole.

57
00:07:15,980 --> 00:07:22,160
And so what we'll find is it gets a little more complicated when you're looking at a larger system and things that affect one system,

58
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:27,860
even if it can affect others, even if that other system is not the direct focus of the toxicant,

59
00:07:28,320 --> 00:07:34,309
because you have to learn to think a little bit holistically. At the same time, pathology has its limits.

60
00:07:34,310 --> 00:07:37,820
We're thinking at a little bit of a higher level, so we're looking with our eyes,

61
00:07:37,820 --> 00:07:44,300
we're looking with a microscope, but our eyes are not an electron microscope or a molecular biology assay.

62
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:50,570
So obviously we can't see what's happening biochemically right at the cellular or the molecular level.

63
00:07:51,170 --> 00:07:59,120
But with the body of knowledge of experimental toxicology, there has been great strides made in tying those things together.

64
00:07:59,630 --> 00:08:05,300
So as we go through kind of our basic path in the beginning of the semester, so explain how that is.

65
00:08:05,300 --> 00:08:12,590
And as we go through our organ system looking examination at the end of the semester, we're going to try to keep tying it back.

66
00:08:12,620 --> 00:08:16,520
This is what the liver looks like when we expose it to this particular toxicant.

67
00:08:17,060 --> 00:08:24,050
Let's take that back to what we already know about what that talk that is doing, what that toxicant is doing biochemically.

68
00:08:24,140 --> 00:08:28,030
So we're going to try to kind of keep doing that down. It's been going back and forth through the semester.

69
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:30,670
So how are we going to do this? How indeed.

70
00:08:31,570 --> 00:08:39,520
So if you had different backgrounds, if some of you have been exposed or know a pathology from the medical side,

71
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:43,360
the way people usually teach pathology, stand old rock around,

72
00:08:43,690 --> 00:08:47,739
the way people usually teach pathology in medical school is actually a pretty long

73
00:08:47,740 --> 00:08:52,090
sequence because it's really hard to know the abnormal before you know the normal.

74
00:08:52,510 --> 00:08:57,040
So usually you have some type of anatomy and physiology which are often separate courses.

75
00:08:57,580 --> 00:09:02,690
You might have biochemistry. Then if you're going to do pathology, you need to learn normal histology.

76
00:09:02,690 --> 00:09:06,660
So that's usually of course, only then do you start pathology.

77
00:09:06,670 --> 00:09:13,840
And usually you do that in like a sequence where there's a general pathology class which teaches you what are the basic mechanisms of disease,

78
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:21,700
and then there's organ specific or systemic pathology. So that's, I don't know, four or five classes there, but we don't have that kind of time.

79
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:25,810
We have to compress it all into one. So how the heck are we going to do that?

80
00:09:26,380 --> 00:09:33,370
So that was my challenge where I sort of developed the class, but kind of come up with a way that it kind of works in the context of toxicology.

81
00:09:34,810 --> 00:09:39,760
So we'll get back to this. The first would have to go to trial sort of thing.

82
00:09:43,890 --> 00:09:47,950
Here going to be okay.

83
00:09:48,210 --> 00:09:54,600
So with my sort of pathology focused on residents, I have one,

84
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:59,370
two particular slide that I often show them because even they're like in the medical or the veterinary medical field,

85
00:09:59,820 --> 00:10:02,879
there's often a little bit of intimidation about pathology pathologists.

86
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:08,470
These weird words, they will get like pink and purple pictures and pretend they could see something.

87
00:10:08,470 --> 00:10:16,590
So it's like people are a little intimidated by it. But I have a slide that says all of pathology in one slide, and it's a little bit facetious,

88
00:10:16,590 --> 00:10:22,800
but what it's saying is that all pathology is really is the idea that the body gets injured.

89
00:10:23,340 --> 00:10:27,459
So there's tissue injury and then the body has to respond to that.

90
00:10:27,460 --> 00:10:33,060
It has to fix itself somehow. So there's a cleanup response, which we'll learn is inflammation.

91
00:10:33,150 --> 00:10:41,340
So inflammation to a broader concept. And sometimes we think about it and then there's a resolution, and the resolution can either be repair.

92
00:10:41,340 --> 00:10:46,190
You could regenerate the tissue that was there before, or if you can't fix it the way it was before,

93
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:49,380
you have to kind of patch it up somehow so there can be scarring.

94
00:10:50,040 --> 00:10:54,419
So really all the different words, all the different syndromes, all the different things you have,

95
00:10:54,420 --> 00:10:58,380
the pathology are either a tissue injury, a body response or a resolution.

96
00:10:59,520 --> 00:11:04,840
So for medical or medical students, sometimes that's a little oversimplified for them.

97
00:11:04,860 --> 00:11:06,120
They get a little antsy about it.

98
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:13,800
But really it's a helpful concept because otherwise pathology becomes like the largest game of Trivial Pursuit that you've ever played.

99
00:11:14,130 --> 00:11:18,030
And it seems like all these different things can happen and happen after memorize everything.

100
00:11:18,030 --> 00:11:21,690
How many remember all this? But if you really think of it in context,

101
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:30,570
it helps you remember things and it helps you understand things better because there really are kind of a sort of limited repertoire

102
00:11:30,570 --> 00:11:39,660
of body responses and understanding what the basic process is allows you to kind of see which different conditions have similarities.

103
00:11:39,660 --> 00:11:43,920
It allows you to see when something is a little bit different or a little bit off from what you expect.

104
00:11:44,310 --> 00:11:47,910
It allows you to follow it from kind of a passive biology or a mechanistic standpoint.

105
00:11:48,900 --> 00:11:52,140
So that might come a little bit more clear as we go through the semester.

106
00:11:52,350 --> 00:11:55,830
But with that in mind that all pathology can be explained in that one slide.

107
00:11:56,010 --> 00:12:05,010
The way I've split the class is that in our first sections, like our first six or so lectures, we're going to do our general histology and pathology.

108
00:12:05,160 --> 00:12:12,000
There's all the general stuff. So today, once we get past all the housekeeping things, we're going to talk just about a general intro to Talkspace.

109
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:15,270
So we're not even going to do real pathology today.

110
00:12:15,270 --> 00:12:20,610
We're just going to talk about where does pathology fit in the context of toxicology and environmental health?

111
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:30,090
What are some fields of application for it? So it's just kind of our general intro to set the stage the next week we're going to do next week.

112
00:12:30,090 --> 00:12:32,820
It's fun. We're going to do our intro to Histology.

113
00:12:33,690 --> 00:12:38,099
So we're going to talk about when you're looking at those little pictures of pink and purple stuff, what are we seeing?

114
00:12:38,100 --> 00:12:41,520
What what is it? Which part of that is the cell? Which part of the nucleus?

115
00:12:41,520 --> 00:12:46,860
Where is the tissue as a whole? And when you look at one of those pictures, there are some it can be intimidating,

116
00:12:46,860 --> 00:12:50,670
but there are some basic guidelines that will help you identify what it is that you're seeing.

117
00:12:51,180 --> 00:12:56,400
So next week will be intro to histology. Traditionally, that's one we have very varying levels of background.

118
00:12:56,410 --> 00:13:02,010
Some people have taken entire histo courses, so people have never really looked at that type of thing at all.

119
00:13:02,310 --> 00:13:09,660
But I walk you through it and that's the basis that we're going to need later in the course when we start looking at actual tissue pictures of organs.

120
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:17,910
So that's our intro stuff, and then we're going to do that. This is basic pathology sequence, cellular adaptation and injury.

121
00:13:17,910 --> 00:13:22,319
So I'm sure you've had some review of this or some knowledge of this,

122
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:26,879
like in a biochemistry course and you talk about what should be happening and what things when things go wrong.

123
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:30,120
And so we're going to look at cellular adaptation and injury at the tissue level.

124
00:13:30,360 --> 00:13:34,380
So that's body injury then body response.

125
00:13:34,500 --> 00:13:37,830
So I told you there a cleanup response and that involves inflammation.

126
00:13:38,280 --> 00:13:44,960
So we're going to talk about the different types of inflammation and how does that play into the body's response to adaptation and injuries?

127
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:49,440
There's a time course involved there, and then we have to do the resolution.

128
00:13:50,010 --> 00:13:53,460
So the resolution is either repair, regeneration or scarring.

129
00:13:53,640 --> 00:13:56,760
So we're going to talk about that as the clothes of our sequence.

130
00:13:57,300 --> 00:14:00,720
And then we have what kind of break down my little paradigm a bit.

131
00:14:01,350 --> 00:14:10,530
We had a special section on Neoplasia, which you can kind of think of as a dysregulated form of proliferation.

132
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:17,190
So regeneration of the tissue is going to involve cells proliferating, but obviously that process has to be pretty controlled.

133
00:14:17,700 --> 00:14:23,040
Neoplasia uses a lot of the same mechanisms, but is a dysregulated form of it.

134
00:14:23,400 --> 00:14:26,520
So that ties a little bit into our regeneration part.

135
00:14:26,520 --> 00:14:29,250
So that one just by logistics we have to do together.

136
00:14:29,880 --> 00:14:37,740
But that gets us through our basic sequence of those, give you the tools that you need to understand pathology at the organ level.

137
00:14:39,660 --> 00:14:46,240
Talk about the kind of logistics of the midterm and everything in a second. Then the second part of the class is systems pathology.

138
00:14:46,740 --> 00:14:50,490
So, you know, we can do a lot of things. We can't do everything.

139
00:14:50,500 --> 00:14:55,230
So I couldn't pick every organ system because you guys, that would be torture for you.

140
00:14:56,220 --> 00:15:00,470
But I picked ones that are of particular relevance for toxicology.

141
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:04,480
So we're going to start with the liver. And the first when we start kind of slow.

142
00:15:04,500 --> 00:15:09,240
So for the first system, the first day, we just talk about normal structure and function of the liver.

143
00:15:09,630 --> 00:15:12,270
And then the next lecture, we start getting into pathology.

144
00:15:12,270 --> 00:15:17,760
So we start bringing in all of the stuff we learned in the first part of the class and applying it to that normal structure

145
00:15:17,770 --> 00:15:24,270
function and seeing what happens when things get out of whack and then somebody will do the same for the kidney and the lung.

146
00:15:24,540 --> 00:15:27,180
So there's some highlights of what we're going to talk about there.

147
00:15:27,660 --> 00:15:33,360
And then finally, the last system was really, really hard to pick and choose their systems is the nervous system.

148
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:36,870
So those are the four systems that we're going to cover.

149
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:43,950
I'm sorry if your favorite system isn't there, but like I said, it's one day a week and it's already a long Friday.

150
00:15:44,610 --> 00:15:46,020
So we have to kind of pick and choose.

151
00:15:46,410 --> 00:15:53,309
But the good thing is that the basic tools that you're going to learn with those organ systems actually gives you a basis for approaching

152
00:15:53,310 --> 00:15:58,890
other organ systems that you might be focusing on in your research or that you might read about when you're reading an article.

153
00:15:59,340 --> 00:16:04,470
So there is some generality or some applicability to what we're going to learn from other systems.

154
00:16:05,130 --> 00:16:10,080
And then at the end of the semester, the big ones, my favorite class.

155
00:16:10,080 --> 00:16:15,360
I do hope that whole semester just to get to this class, we're going to do historical research to practice what you've learned,

156
00:16:16,470 --> 00:16:18,959
and that's where we're going to kind of try to broaden a little bit.

157
00:16:18,960 --> 00:16:27,000
It's kind of usually a fun less, I don't know, less stressful in some ways, way to end the semester.

158
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,280
But then I'm going to kind of bring some other slides in.

159
00:16:29,280 --> 00:16:34,320
I might take some other organ systems that people have expressed interest in that you might not have seen.

160
00:16:34,740 --> 00:16:38,729
And we're going to kind of do a little fun back and forth where we try to interpret

161
00:16:38,730 --> 00:16:42,210
those lesions using principles you learned from the other organ systems,

162
00:16:42,450 --> 00:16:44,940
but try to see if you could broaden or generalize that a little bit.

163
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:49,890
So here's the puzzles really from my favorite class of the semester, and we'll do that at the end.

164
00:16:50,010 --> 00:16:55,050
So if there's systems we haven't covered, we can bring some of them and hopefully at that time.

165
00:16:56,070 --> 00:17:00,090
All right. Does that give you a sense where we're going? All right.

166
00:17:00,090 --> 00:17:04,680
Let's do some basic how you like housekeeping.

167
00:17:04,920 --> 00:17:13,889
How does the course work? Okay. So in terms of assessments, the course has three components.

168
00:17:13,890 --> 00:17:17,430
Basically, there are homework quizzes.

169
00:17:17,640 --> 00:17:24,360
These are open book or open canvas, I guess open book canvas quizzes.

170
00:17:24,360 --> 00:17:27,740
So they're on canvas. They do have a time limit in them.

171
00:17:27,750 --> 00:17:30,630
It's a pretty generous time limit and they're open book.

172
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:37,410
So what you what you can do, what you should do is look at your PowerPoint, have that open, you know,

173
00:17:37,410 --> 00:17:41,460
have reviewed it ahead of time so that you don't have to go wildly flipping through the slides.

174
00:17:42,030 --> 00:17:47,219
And it's really intended to help you sort of keep up with the material each week by having to do that.

175
00:17:47,220 --> 00:17:49,680
So it's kind of a little bit of way of enforcing studying,

176
00:17:50,040 --> 00:17:55,140
but there are open format canvas quizzes and for most of them you get sort of two shots at it.

177
00:17:55,260 --> 00:18:01,020
So there's like a lot of time, period. The ideal way to do it is sort of review the PowerPoint ahead of time.

178
00:18:01,020 --> 00:18:02,550
So you sort of know what the basis is.

179
00:18:03,090 --> 00:18:09,240
Go ahead and take the quizzes, make your notes to yourself that if you're not satisfied with your first grade, you get sort of another shot at it.

180
00:18:09,750 --> 00:18:16,680
So it's really not, you know, a high stakes thing. As I said, it's intended for you to help you study.

181
00:18:16,680 --> 00:18:19,919
And there are 14 of them.

182
00:18:19,920 --> 00:18:23,670
I think there are 14 above, but the two lowest grades are dropped.

183
00:18:24,030 --> 00:18:29,819
So if you have a we agree, just swamped with your other classes and you can't get to the quiz or you just you know,

184
00:18:29,820 --> 00:18:33,450
you did your two shots and it didn't really work out that well. You're going to drop the lowest two.

185
00:18:33,990 --> 00:18:38,220
Okay. So that's kind of the basis for the quizzes. So homeworks quizzes.

186
00:18:39,030 --> 00:18:46,650
And then there's a midterm exam which is also on canvas, which is also open notes, which might seem a little bit strange,

187
00:18:47,190 --> 00:18:51,630
but it's because I'm trying to structure the question so you can apply a little bit of what you learned.

188
00:18:52,210 --> 00:18:56,850
It doesn't really. I found I did that first when we had the pandemic.

189
00:18:57,360 --> 00:19:04,590
And interestingly, I found that the class averages were like really about the same as what I used to give in class closed book tests.

190
00:19:05,040 --> 00:19:12,809
But it actually helped me because rather than just having you like cram a bunch of stuff and just regurgitate strict memory in class,

191
00:19:12,810 --> 00:19:18,300
I found that people were able to like, relax, remove that. Oh my God, I can't remember a part and apply it a little bit more.

192
00:19:19,020 --> 00:19:23,790
We'll talk a little bit more about that. But what the format is and everything as the time gets closer is that.

193
00:19:24,360 --> 00:19:31,160
But the midterm is open book in Kansas and you get a week so I open it on October 7th.

194
00:19:31,260 --> 00:19:36,479
You've got a week to finish it and I think about to look at it again.

195
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:41,400
I think it's a two hour block. So it's designed by my copyright.

196
00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:45,400
It's designed as a two hour test. I think you actually had a three hour block to take it.

197
00:19:45,850 --> 00:19:54,910
So it's designed to. There is some time pressure because it behooves you to kind of have some time pressure to just finish the thing.

198
00:19:55,690 --> 00:19:58,690
But you have some flexibility as to when you take it during that week.

199
00:19:59,210 --> 00:20:03,580
Okay. So that's the midterm. And the midterm only covers like our basic path.

200
00:20:03,760 --> 00:20:08,800
Right. So we did that general histology and pathology, the beginning part, and that's what's going to be on the midterm.

201
00:20:09,190 --> 00:20:15,280
And then we switch to systems pathology. So we learn about normal structure and function and pathology.

202
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:19,120
And then the final is covering our systems. Okay.

203
00:20:19,420 --> 00:20:22,780
The final, it doesn't cover anything per say.

204
00:20:22,780 --> 00:20:25,660
Like there's not specific questions from the first half of the class,

205
00:20:25,990 --> 00:20:32,180
but obviously the stuff you learn in the first class helps you in the second part, you know, in order to interpret organs.

206
00:20:32,500 --> 00:20:35,920
And nothing none of the weird organs that we do from here. So clues are on the file.

207
00:20:36,040 --> 00:20:40,540
It's just the stuff we learn, of course. Okay. Four eight.

208
00:20:40,550 --> 00:20:45,710
Okay. So that's kind of the assessment part. Yeah.

209
00:20:45,890 --> 00:20:50,700
So there's that. Um, this is a logical place.

210
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:54,200
This is what the module section looks like. We've already seen this.

211
00:20:54,230 --> 00:20:59,450
This is kind of the basis, literally the textbook for the class. So for each thing, there's usually a PowerPoint.

212
00:20:59,840 --> 00:21:06,260
And then there's this review thing. So when we're in class going through this stuff, there's a lot of information coming out.

213
00:21:06,440 --> 00:21:11,930
And as with every class, some of it is more, you know, relevant, some of it's more tangential.

214
00:21:12,200 --> 00:21:18,470
So with every class, there's a review sheet, doesn't have answers on it, but it kind of hits what are the main points that we tried to cover.

215
00:21:19,040 --> 00:21:23,330
So when you go through your PowerPoint after class, you're getting ready for your quiz.

216
00:21:23,750 --> 00:21:27,530
This review sheet will sort of help you. Okay. What other things are likely going to be on the quiz?

217
00:21:27,950 --> 00:21:31,130
So you can have that out like kind of while you're reviewing the PowerPoint.

218
00:21:31,700 --> 00:21:35,389
Some people find it useful to have it out in class as the slides are going.

219
00:21:35,390 --> 00:21:39,500
They can make well notes to themselves. Other people find that distracting. However you want to use it.

220
00:21:39,950 --> 00:21:45,470
But there should be a review sheet for each of the modules and that can help you kind of win all this stuff down too.

221
00:21:47,330 --> 00:21:50,450
It'll help you when you're studying and help you win all the stuff down to what's most relevant.

222
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:54,320
Okay, so that's for each little thingy. All right.

223
00:21:54,380 --> 00:21:57,680
Modules. Any questions on that organization?

224
00:22:01,740 --> 00:22:07,310
Picture of an organ here that we'll talk about later. You kind of stare at that and muse about what you might be seeing.

225
00:22:07,320 --> 00:22:11,410
Well, arrows might be indicating. Okay.

226
00:22:11,800 --> 00:22:16,690
So other stuff. So I said, my name is Ingrid Bergen.

227
00:22:16,690 --> 00:22:20,110
I'm a veterinary pathologist, what that is.

228
00:22:21,640 --> 00:22:25,240
But essentially I work in the medical school.

229
00:22:26,380 --> 00:22:31,960
I am the director of the core lab. We call it the invisible animal core.

230
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:35,350
It's kind of a silly name. It's really a pathology core.

231
00:22:35,410 --> 00:22:41,889
So we provide pathology services to the investigators who have kind of two focuses.

232
00:22:41,890 --> 00:22:45,070
We provide research support, pathology to investigators.

233
00:22:45,430 --> 00:22:52,080
So if you're running a study, you need someone to, I don't know, make some slides of the liver and write a report interpreting liver pathology.

234
00:22:52,090 --> 00:22:59,980
We do that for investigators on the campus, and we also do diagnostic pathology for the Animal Care and Use Program.

235
00:23:00,430 --> 00:23:04,810
So there's you know, there are laboratory animals being used on campus.

236
00:23:05,170 --> 00:23:12,720
There's a large number of regulations governing their use. And one of the regulations stipulates that if they become sick, you know,

237
00:23:12,730 --> 00:23:17,710
if they show signs of illness other than what you might expect in the context of a study.

238
00:23:18,490 --> 00:23:24,340
We have a responsibility for investigating that. So there's a whole veterinary division in the unit for lab animal medicine,

239
00:23:24,700 --> 00:23:28,420
and we provide the pathology support for the clinical veterinarians of that division.

240
00:23:28,430 --> 00:23:35,140
So we do some diagnostic pathology as well. The unit for Lab Animal Medicine has a veterinary residency training.

241
00:23:35,590 --> 00:23:39,459
Veterinarians who want to specialize in laboratory animal medicine.

242
00:23:39,460 --> 00:23:44,410
And we train both residents in pathology. That's kind of the context.

243
00:23:44,650 --> 00:23:47,380
And I'll give you a little more background on me when we do the lecture.

244
00:23:48,190 --> 00:23:56,550
So I am situated at North Campus Research Complex, so that's up on Plymouth Road, kind of about north of the engineering complex.

245
00:23:56,590 --> 00:24:02,300
So I'm kind of far from as much because I'm kind of distant.

246
00:24:02,350 --> 00:24:06,879
If you if you want to meet with me for office hours, it's usually best if you kind of send me,

247
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:11,950
shoot me an email and we arrange a time either when I'm here or we can do a zoom or something.

248
00:24:12,550 --> 00:24:20,110
But I'm very open to office hour appointments. I don't have an office here, so it's a little bit of waiting.

249
00:24:20,650 --> 00:24:23,740
But just shoot me an email and I'd be happy to arrange a time to be with you.

250
00:24:24,430 --> 00:24:30,220
Okay. I think there's no required texts for the class.

251
00:24:31,030 --> 00:24:32,709
As I said, we have the modules,

252
00:24:32,710 --> 00:24:40,510
so the presentations and all the materials necessary for successful completion are on the campus site because the course,

253
00:24:40,510 --> 00:24:43,629
you know, is kind of a distillation of five different courses.

254
00:24:43,630 --> 00:24:50,320
I pull from a lot of different reference materials. A lot of these are sort of classic texts, either a toxicology or a pathology.

255
00:24:50,890 --> 00:24:56,080
Both of these texts are really all three that I've shown here are available electronically through Taubman.

256
00:24:56,500 --> 00:25:02,830
So I put the sites here. So if there's I mean usually on my slides all like, right, which texts I took it from and what the figure is.

257
00:25:03,280 --> 00:25:07,389
So if you want to get a little bit more explanation of something or read a little bit deeper,

258
00:25:07,390 --> 00:25:12,700
these are some suggested texts that are all available through Taubman.

259
00:25:13,210 --> 00:25:13,840
They're pretty big.

260
00:25:13,840 --> 00:25:20,200
So, I mean, I would suggest for these, except maybe the histology for these texts, they're like, you know, a couple hundred bucks each.

261
00:25:20,200 --> 00:25:27,490
So it's nice that we have them through Taubman, but it's not necessarily I'm going to give you the information that you need to succeed in the class.

262
00:25:28,270 --> 00:25:33,219
There is also Michigan medicine, where it teaches histo to histology,

263
00:25:33,220 --> 00:25:38,590
to the medical students and to some of the graduate students in their biomedical programs.

264
00:25:38,590 --> 00:25:47,020
There's also a really nice histology class that has digital slides and normal tissues and organs available online to make that link.

265
00:25:47,350 --> 00:25:53,690
But there is a little online source if you want to look at more histology or practice a little bit.

266
00:25:53,710 --> 00:25:56,980
So that's another nice resource available to you. Okay.

267
00:25:58,090 --> 00:26:01,149
Is anyone taking a histo class here or done?

268
00:26:01,150 --> 00:26:05,170
A little bit. A little bit time. Oh, cool.

269
00:26:07,740 --> 00:26:13,950
Okay. So as I said, I kind of got to the goals of the course are to acquire a basic understanding of the

270
00:26:13,950 --> 00:26:21,180
language techniques and context of toxicological pathology and experimental pathology.

271
00:26:21,420 --> 00:26:29,520
So as we'll find a lot of times in my field, when you say toxicology pathology, really what people mean is actually industrial or regulatory path.

272
00:26:29,940 --> 00:26:40,350
So a lot of people with my background work in pharma or for zero looking at the preclinical phase or the animal testing phase of drug development.

273
00:26:40,860 --> 00:26:49,829
So in my field, traditionally toxicological toxicology pathology often refers to that industry application, but really it's much broader than that.

274
00:26:49,830 --> 00:26:57,810
Here we do experimental toxicology pathology, as many of you are in courses that follow something of that nature.

275
00:26:58,230 --> 00:27:05,340
And really pathology can be experimental as well. So we're trying to kind of get an understanding of that or trying to acquire a

276
00:27:05,340 --> 00:27:10,170
physiologic and systems based understanding in the context of exposure to toxicants.

277
00:27:10,740 --> 00:27:14,160
And we're trying to understand how to structure organization of organ systems

278
00:27:14,160 --> 00:27:18,630
reflects their function and how pathology integrates with other findings.

279
00:27:19,230 --> 00:27:21,240
And importantly, as we go along,

280
00:27:21,930 --> 00:27:33,210
we're going to talk just about the use of animals and the use of or animal related to animal derived tissues or whole animals in toxicology.

281
00:27:33,960 --> 00:27:41,040
Why we might do this and where are the pitfalls and limitations are of that approach, as many of you know,

282
00:27:41,040 --> 00:27:47,910
and what it will address a little bit in class, the use of animals in toxicology and in biomedical research in general is a bit controversial.

283
00:27:48,180 --> 00:27:52,200
There are regulatory controls on it, but still it's a whole animal.

284
00:27:52,260 --> 00:27:57,600
And it's we really have to think from an ethical standpoint, from a logistics standpoint,

285
00:27:57,810 --> 00:28:05,100
from a relevant standpoint and from a financial standpoint, under what circumstances is it appropriate to use animals in research?

286
00:28:05,430 --> 00:28:13,380
And where can we perhaps find another approach that might be better at getting us to our goal, which is the relevance to humans?

287
00:28:14,040 --> 00:28:20,430
So we have time to do a little bit of that. It's not the whole focus of the course, but I think that's an important aspect to be aware of.

288
00:28:20,760 --> 00:28:31,550
Whether you're in research or industry, some courses have particular competencies, some sort of course of study in a particular competency.

289
00:28:31,560 --> 00:28:43,379
Then this class meets two of those, the one for talks, masters and talks, and really doesn't affect the way this course is conducted in any way.

290
00:28:43,380 --> 00:28:47,520
But some for some people, this course is a requirement to meet certain competencies.

291
00:28:48,150 --> 00:28:57,600
We already talked about the course requirements, schedule policies.

292
00:28:57,660 --> 00:29:01,500
So we have this cool little owl thing, which is really neat.

293
00:29:01,500 --> 00:29:09,720
I tested out the other day. It follows me wherever I go. So we have this cool owl thing recording hopefully through Panopto.

294
00:29:09,870 --> 00:29:15,630
So on our course site we're going to be putting all those recordings on the Panopto recordings panel.

295
00:29:16,050 --> 00:29:22,570
So if you're sick, if you have to miss class or for like I was thinking about my weekend, I really need to replay that part of the class.

296
00:29:22,570 --> 00:29:28,230
I can't remember what she was saying. There should be the recordings there on Panopto, so hopefully that will work well.

297
00:29:30,120 --> 00:29:32,849
So that means you are recorded.

298
00:29:32,850 --> 00:29:39,839
If there's any difficulty with that, please discuss it with me and we can discuss alternative arrangements the way it shows the whole class.

299
00:29:39,840 --> 00:29:42,840
You're all about this because you can't really recognize yourself.

300
00:29:42,840 --> 00:29:46,410
So the classroom expectations of etiquette.

301
00:29:46,980 --> 00:29:52,230
So this class is heavily dependent on open discussion, particularly in the second part.

302
00:29:52,620 --> 00:29:54,600
And the second part. I'm showing you slides.

303
00:29:55,080 --> 00:30:05,040
We all know each other by then and I'll ask you questions and I'm going to be hoping that people will chip in and say and say what you think it is.

304
00:30:05,190 --> 00:30:10,259
And hopefully we're going to cultivate a class environment where it's totally okay.

305
00:30:10,260 --> 00:30:14,190
In fact, it's expected that you are wrong. It's okay to be wrong.

306
00:30:14,790 --> 00:30:19,590
I think it's very difficult. Many of our courses, you know what? The instructor asks for questions.

307
00:30:20,160 --> 00:30:23,670
You know, it's human. There's a natural tendency to be a lot of them. I don't I'm not going to say anything. I want to be wrong.

308
00:30:23,670 --> 00:30:31,319
What are people going to think? But pathology, you really have to learn by speaking and then by but doing it and in pathology training,

309
00:30:31,320 --> 00:30:36,810
like for my background in a veterinary residency, you get there from the very first day,

310
00:30:36,900 --> 00:30:39,900
they'll show a lesion or you're at the microscope all sitting around a multi-headed

311
00:30:39,900 --> 00:30:43,110
microscope and you're going around the room and it could be your first day.

312
00:30:43,180 --> 00:30:47,850
There's someone next to you is doing it for three years and you don't know anything.

313
00:30:47,910 --> 00:30:52,160
So like every time it comes around to your terminology, okay, what do you think you're like?

314
00:30:52,650 --> 00:30:55,470
It paints a purple. You have no idea.

315
00:30:55,950 --> 00:31:03,540
But the good thing is that it's not acceptable in that setting for people to just spit it out and you have to kind of talk your way,

316
00:31:03,540 --> 00:31:06,660
like explain your thought process as you go and the good.

317
00:31:06,720 --> 00:31:08,130
Thing about it is that, one,

318
00:31:08,760 --> 00:31:14,249
it kind of kills that part of you that's afraid of talking because everybody is wrong so frequently that you kind of learn

319
00:31:14,250 --> 00:31:21,960
that that's part of the process and it teaches your brain how to iterate your way to an answer when you are confused.

320
00:31:22,350 --> 00:31:25,650
And so we'll learn how that is when we have the organ systems in the second half.

321
00:31:26,040 --> 00:31:31,679
But it's really important that we're okay with being wrong and that it's better to say, okay, I don't know what this is,

322
00:31:31,680 --> 00:31:39,419
but to me it looks like that's a tubular organ and there are some cells that look like kind of peppers sprinkled on the side.

323
00:31:39,420 --> 00:31:43,620
So I think that might be a tubular origin with inflammation, perfectly acceptable answer.

324
00:31:43,710 --> 00:31:48,090
So you don't have to know the parts speak, you don't know the special words. We just have to describe.

325
00:31:48,210 --> 00:31:55,020
Iterate our way to an answer. So the expectation is that there is an atmosphere of mutual respect, encouragement.

326
00:31:55,020 --> 00:32:02,610
We can work together to get an answer. That's the way the course works best, and it's a challenge when it's this big.

327
00:32:02,910 --> 00:32:08,370
But hopefully by that time in the course we'll be kind of comfortable with that type of learning.

328
00:32:09,660 --> 00:32:13,200
As far as other expectations, you have your online quizzes and exams.

329
00:32:14,010 --> 00:32:17,159
The expectation is that you will complete them each as an individual.

330
00:32:17,160 --> 00:32:20,990
So yes, you're open book, but they're intended as individual assessments.

331
00:32:21,010 --> 00:32:27,420
You just want to complete those on your own. You can study together and kind of mull over things together, but the assessments should be on your own.

332
00:32:28,380 --> 00:32:37,050
Questions about that, just let me know. So again, we've already talked about about integrity in terms of your behavior.

333
00:32:37,050 --> 00:32:39,750
And the class never had an issue with that with this class.

334
00:32:41,280 --> 00:32:46,800
But essentially the expectation is that the conduct is consistent with that of a professional person.

335
00:32:47,070 --> 00:32:51,420
And that goes both ways from instructor to students and students to instructor.

336
00:32:52,200 --> 00:32:59,430
So if anyone has any questions or concerns about that or concerns arise through the semester, I encourage you to approach me with those.

337
00:33:00,600 --> 00:33:06,360
You also have resources through the School of Public Health and through the Rackham Graduate School,

338
00:33:06,360 --> 00:33:12,360
and there are links here both to the standards of academic conduct and the policies of the Rackham graduate school.

339
00:33:12,840 --> 00:33:18,990
So like I said, I've never had issues with that in this class, but there are resources available if you ever have concerns.

340
00:33:19,560 --> 00:33:25,890
And finally, in terms of well-being, you know, we've all kind of come through a very strange two years.

341
00:33:26,460 --> 00:33:31,590
It's great to be sort of back in the classroom, but that doesn't mean that necessarily everything is back to normal.

342
00:33:31,590 --> 00:33:35,489
And then even without the setting of the past two years,

343
00:33:35,490 --> 00:33:40,680
there are stresses that arise throughout the semester that can sometimes impact your performance of the class.

344
00:33:41,280 --> 00:33:44,270
So if you are having an issue physical,

345
00:33:44,310 --> 00:33:50,670
mental or otherwise or logistic that is affecting your performance or participation in the class, please let me know.

346
00:33:51,420 --> 00:33:54,510
It's better if you reach out to me sooner rather than later.

347
00:33:54,570 --> 00:33:56,980
The only time we've ever had issues is where someone is.

348
00:33:57,090 --> 00:34:02,940
Things are really piling up and they're falling really behind the class and they wait pretty long to let me know.

349
00:34:02,940 --> 00:34:10,889
So it's better to let me know early. There's flexibility and there are, as we were saying before, resources are available outside of this class.

350
00:34:10,890 --> 00:34:17,940
If you're having if you need some sort of if you need some accommodation or some allowances for course completion.

351
00:34:18,690 --> 00:34:23,999
Okay. So there's lots of links there that can be helpful. And then finally, we have the academic calendar.

352
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:28,410
If you expect to miss class or an assignment, we have the recordings to help you out.

353
00:34:28,830 --> 00:34:34,890
But give me a heads up ahead of time, especially if you need a rescheduling for an examination.

354
00:34:35,760 --> 00:34:39,479
We have that. You're doing that at home, you know, during that week online.

355
00:34:39,480 --> 00:34:41,070
So usually that works out fine.

356
00:34:41,490 --> 00:34:48,750
But if you need a change of schedule already to miss because of something, let me know ahead of time so that we can work that out.

357
00:34:49,860 --> 00:34:57,810
All right. That's a lot of stuff. Are there any questions related to how the course is going to run assessments?

358
00:34:59,330 --> 00:35:03,530
The. I think we're pretty good.

359
00:35:04,700 --> 00:35:08,990
All right. So we'll do the time.

360
00:35:09,270 --> 00:35:12,229
I'm pretty good. So, like I said today, it's relatively easy.

361
00:35:12,230 --> 00:35:19,340
We just have the one kind of talks path lecture, I think, and we have like a two hour time period for class.

362
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:27,070
We won't. So we won't always do the full two hour time period, but there are times when we definitely will.

363
00:35:27,080 --> 00:35:31,550
So there are lectures that have quite a bit of information in this building.

364
00:35:32,180 --> 00:35:36,440
So if you need to step out for a minute, it's all okay, just get up and go.

365
00:35:36,800 --> 00:35:41,990
There's restrooms, I think, on the ground floor of the second floor, so weirdly situated in this building.

366
00:35:42,950 --> 00:35:48,920
And then we'll usually take up will always take a break, sort of halfway through so that we don't pass out.

367
00:35:50,090 --> 00:36:01,219
Um, think, think, think. So before we do our tux type lecture, um, I know it's the stereotypical thing to do at the beginning of every semester,

368
00:36:01,220 --> 00:36:08,840
but I wonder if you can just kind of go through the room. Is the biggest class I've taught, so I'm going to do my best to learn the names.

369
00:36:09,140 --> 00:36:14,030
It's going to be a bit of a challenge. And for I sent out an intro email to you guys and canvas.

370
00:36:14,690 --> 00:36:19,669
I asked you to tell me like an organ system of interest to you that helps me with histo palooza.

371
00:36:19,670 --> 00:36:22,550
Because if there's something a lot of people like, I'll pull examples from that.

372
00:36:22,910 --> 00:36:27,260
I'll ask you to tell me your favorite animal species just because I like animals.

373
00:36:27,260 --> 00:36:30,260
And also it kind of help you remember who you are actually.

374
00:36:30,620 --> 00:36:35,420
So you can kind of go through, say your name and your program and your organ system,

375
00:36:35,900 --> 00:36:39,080
and I'll try to remember your favorite animal species, but I might not be able to do it.

376
00:36:39,320 --> 00:36:43,580
So I don't think I'm a NOLA.

377
00:36:43,580 --> 00:36:46,590
I'm a second year, I'm a student, okay?

378
00:36:46,610 --> 00:36:51,890
And I'm interested in the reproductive system. Repro And you didn't give me an animal species this time.

379
00:36:52,700 --> 00:36:59,870
Others are actually into okay.

380
00:37:00,170 --> 00:37:04,140
Bella and repro system. You said okay.

381
00:37:04,160 --> 00:37:07,670
Got it. I'm Chloe. Basically same thing as hers.

382
00:37:07,670 --> 00:37:12,860
The honors and the second year and there's an environmental have and then I said

383
00:37:13,100 --> 00:37:16,190
the renal system was my favorite because I knew we were like learning about it.

384
00:37:16,670 --> 00:37:24,340
But actually cardiovascular is from I used to have a cardiovascular unit that I had, but um, maybe we'll pull some of that stuff into it.

385
00:37:24,500 --> 00:37:28,639
Yeah. I used to work in a cardiology office for a while, so I think that's why I like it.

386
00:37:28,640 --> 00:37:31,970
So. Oh, yeah. Have great slides for that. Yeah. All right.

387
00:37:32,360 --> 00:37:40,700
I'm Jordan. I'm a delivery master's student in the school for environment and Sustainability, and I'm doing a uterus applications for public health.

388
00:37:41,600 --> 00:37:45,799
I am pre-med as well, so that's why I'm really interested in this course.

389
00:37:45,800 --> 00:37:49,160
But I said the renal system and the female. Yes.

390
00:37:49,970 --> 00:37:54,230
Dolphin. Yes. All right. Yeah. Okay.

391
00:37:55,490 --> 00:38:01,220
All right. I'm done. I'm a first year beauty student in the talks program.

392
00:38:02,570 --> 00:38:08,459
I know. It's weird. We have a circular hippo concept a little better, but it would be a big circle out.

393
00:38:08,460 --> 00:38:11,990
Have this many people. I'm interested in the nervous system.

394
00:38:11,990 --> 00:38:18,320
I was a neuroscience undergrad, so that intro toxicity and my favorite animal species.

395
00:38:20,600 --> 00:38:24,080
If I have a strong answer, it's really hard for me to answer that question.

396
00:38:24,230 --> 00:38:27,560
Yeah, I don't really think about animal species, to be honest.

397
00:38:27,590 --> 00:38:30,920
I'm mostly humans, but I guess like I like big cats.

398
00:38:31,370 --> 00:38:36,259
Cats, they're really cool with fur.

399
00:38:36,260 --> 00:38:43,669
When I was at Michigan State in my residency, we did pathology for a lot of zoo animals, so like you would see tigers and stuff.

400
00:38:43,670 --> 00:38:48,250
It's really cool. And that's Izzy.

401
00:38:48,350 --> 00:38:58,490
I'm a first year, I'm a student in toxicology, all my favorite system to be the reproductive system and then probably dogs, too.

402
00:38:58,740 --> 00:39:07,430
All right. Let me you didn't give me a lot of time to write that down to remember it's funny they are the course roster prints out your name,

403
00:39:07,430 --> 00:39:10,700
your program and your program. But I abbreviate the program.

404
00:39:11,570 --> 00:39:15,980
So for everybody in toxicology has your name and then underneath it it says toxic.

405
00:39:18,070 --> 00:39:23,670
It's like, well, I don't know.

406
00:39:23,670 --> 00:39:31,440
It's kind of interesting. You know, a lot of people just recognize all the tough calls.

407
00:39:34,750 --> 00:39:42,970
Hi, everyone. My name's Tiffany. I'm also a two degree master's student in the bio studies and quality department.

408
00:39:43,830 --> 00:39:48,630
I'm really interested in the reproductive system and the nervous system.

409
00:39:49,110 --> 00:39:52,680
And I would say I. I like cats the best.

410
00:39:53,730 --> 00:40:03,530
All right. Okay. Next, Amber, I'm a second year master's student at DHS.

411
00:40:04,530 --> 00:40:09,750
I'm really interested in immuno toxicology or system or even in the lab class.

412
00:40:10,290 --> 00:40:14,100
Are you in the lab first in the afternoon? Yeah. All right. I'm two more in on that.

413
00:40:15,030 --> 00:40:18,180
And my favorite animal are ostriches. I love them.

414
00:40:18,330 --> 00:40:22,070
Oh one have.

415
00:40:24,380 --> 00:40:27,710
It's so funny. Everyone has a lot or a lot of people have like really unusual species.

416
00:40:28,050 --> 00:40:31,090
But like, I like dogs, I like cats, which is okay because I'm for dogs.

417
00:40:31,100 --> 00:40:35,749
It's all right. Where am I going to hire?

418
00:40:35,750 --> 00:40:39,560
On my name aside all I'm a second year MSU in each class.

419
00:40:40,550 --> 00:40:46,100
I'm interested in the endocrine system in general, like hormone athletes and things like that.

420
00:40:46,820 --> 00:40:52,100
And then I think I said my favorite and I remember yours. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

421
00:40:52,730 --> 00:40:55,760
I think that's a good one. That's unique.

422
00:40:55,760 --> 00:41:01,310
So the easy from here, remember? That's really cool. All right, where are we?

423
00:41:02,030 --> 00:41:06,410
Go ahead. Tomorrow. My name is Tom. Yeah, I'm a second year and a student from psychology.

424
00:41:07,790 --> 00:41:15,140
I'm interested in the resistance. And so my favorite station is, uh, cats and dogs.

425
00:41:15,260 --> 00:41:18,739
Excellent. Hi, everyone.

426
00:41:18,740 --> 00:41:23,300
My name is Swati. I'm a second year MPH student in chess.

427
00:41:24,260 --> 00:41:30,500
I'm really interested in the reproductive system and neurodevelopment as well.

428
00:41:31,010 --> 00:41:36,260
And I have a very specific. I like to see British zebrafish.

429
00:41:36,260 --> 00:41:39,260
Yeah, yeah. I mean, you work in a lab.

430
00:41:39,620 --> 00:41:41,870
Yeah, yeah. Facebook.

431
00:41:43,800 --> 00:41:53,270
So that was from a research point of view, zebrafish are my favorite species to work with, but otherwise, I really like penguins.

432
00:41:53,450 --> 00:41:56,700
Oh, cool. Yeah, we have some good on zebrafish for us.

433
00:41:56,720 --> 00:42:00,500
We do a lot of work with zebrafish investigators. We have some really good fats from zebrafish.

434
00:42:00,500 --> 00:42:03,530
Maybe we can talk about this. All right.

435
00:42:03,680 --> 00:42:05,959
Hi, everyone. My name is Rachel.

436
00:42:05,960 --> 00:42:14,720
I'm a second year student in Environmental Health Sciences, and my favorite organ system is definitely the central nervous system.

437
00:42:15,050 --> 00:42:23,720
But then if I had to pick another, like, organ that I like, I like the adrenal glands, I think that honestly, I'm honestly, that's cool.

438
00:42:23,780 --> 00:42:28,819
And that gave you a specific animal to limit flavor rights in general.

439
00:42:28,820 --> 00:42:35,630
But that's cool. I did when I worked in private practice, I worked at a practice that did work for like little local zoo things,

440
00:42:35,960 --> 00:42:41,600
and they used to bring in ringtone lemurs, which was pretty cool. Hi.

441
00:42:42,020 --> 00:42:46,130
Hi. I'm Margaret. And then secondarily, a classic psychology program.

442
00:42:49,010 --> 00:42:52,040
Liver. Liver. That's our first one. Good.

443
00:42:54,050 --> 00:42:57,740
I do. Armadillo. That's really cool.

444
00:43:01,070 --> 00:43:04,370
You guys are really trying to figure it out. You know what?

445
00:43:05,190 --> 00:43:09,680
There's, like, an infectious disease condition that armadillos are really susceptible to.

446
00:43:09,880 --> 00:43:18,680
So that's how I know they're actually really susceptible to the bacteria that causes leprosy.

447
00:43:20,600 --> 00:43:25,370
But, I mean, most people don't come in contact with armadillos, so it's not too much of a problem.

448
00:43:26,210 --> 00:43:31,840
But that's actually if they're used and they're not used in biomedical research, but people study that susceptibility.

449
00:43:32,120 --> 00:43:37,100
That's like a clue to the pathogenesis of the bacteria. That's my go to for armadillos.

450
00:43:38,510 --> 00:43:44,000
All right. Do we have that time? I'm barely a second year student, and they just were excellent.

451
00:43:44,570 --> 00:43:48,770
And I think I gave you, like, multiple for every answer.

452
00:43:49,970 --> 00:43:54,740
I am interested in the endocrine system and we don't really know more about it, but you hear about it.

453
00:43:54,740 --> 00:43:57,850
So yeah. And it seems like the public really knows.

454
00:43:57,860 --> 00:44:04,850
They ask you questions and you're like, Yeah. And then for an animal, I like just came off of this phenomenal dove trip.

455
00:44:04,880 --> 00:44:08,870
So it's like everything. Yeah. You went to the Galapagos, right?

456
00:44:09,110 --> 00:44:12,790
Yeah, I think. Right.

457
00:44:15,270 --> 00:44:18,920
I think every show, every class, I mean, like, I don't really know.

458
00:44:19,790 --> 00:44:26,750
I know it's going to be one of those, like, swimming iguanas. So, you know, just about everything.

459
00:44:26,810 --> 00:44:30,080
Excellent. You didn't see called the melanoma.

460
00:44:30,230 --> 00:44:40,270
Oh, that's like big blob terrapins. Yeah, I think that it just like you said at the top of the class, it can not do anything.

461
00:44:40,620 --> 00:44:44,880
I guess you'll have to go back to see that. Hi.

462
00:44:45,970 --> 00:44:49,790
Hi. I'm Sarah. I'm a first year student.

463
00:44:49,820 --> 00:44:55,790
I'm interested in the endocrine and reproductive systems, and I think I give a two animal answers to for pets.

464
00:44:55,790 --> 00:45:00,370
I like dogs, but for just like any animal, I think axolotl animals.

465
00:45:00,470 --> 00:45:03,590
And I think you guys know what that axolotls are.

466
00:45:03,590 --> 00:45:10,370
They're like a cool salamander type. They have the attention think just so they keep their gills in adulthood.

467
00:45:10,910 --> 00:45:12,000
And people look at that.

468
00:45:12,020 --> 00:45:20,750
People study them because they can regenerate their limbs to an amazing degree and they do for like lots of pictures on the Internet.

469
00:45:22,660 --> 00:45:29,570
And so my first year I was like, if I had to choose, that would probably be like.

470
00:45:30,590 --> 00:45:35,190
The immune system. I think. Are you in the lab as well? Yeah, yeah, yeah.

471
00:45:35,210 --> 00:45:39,010
We do a laboratory in there. You gave me a very interesting answer.

472
00:45:39,020 --> 00:45:43,640
Maybe you want to ask if you've ever worked in talk. I didn't work in pharmaceutical.

473
00:45:43,970 --> 00:45:47,810
Oh, you said cynomolgus macaques. Yeah. So that was very.

474
00:45:47,810 --> 00:45:51,350
I think a lot of people would just say primates. We said a very specific kind of private.

475
00:45:51,500 --> 00:45:57,040
I'd really rather. So it's an amalgam of attacks. So attack is a it's a monkey, essentially.

476
00:45:57,060 --> 00:45:58,340
There's different kinds of attacks.

477
00:45:58,340 --> 00:46:05,810
And then was there one particular time that we do a lot and toxicology and there are they're also just really cool animals, really smart.

478
00:46:06,920 --> 00:46:10,910
Yeah, that's a good answer. All right. We got. I'm David.

479
00:46:11,240 --> 00:46:20,690
I'm a first year student growing through all systems, but I guess one has narrowed it down to the liver and endocrine.

480
00:46:21,170 --> 00:46:31,280
All right. And I'm favorite animal I we have figured out over I think of the interesting is the pistol strain and it actually strikes so fast that

481
00:46:31,280 --> 00:46:40,040
it creates this water bubble and creates plasma might be the way to actually create a plasma afterwards with cool the weird thing that

482
00:46:40,040 --> 00:46:47,720
I know about that if anybody in this room have kids but there's like a little kids cartoon show called The Octopus that's like little

483
00:46:48,380 --> 00:46:55,280
creatures and they like a little spaceship that go around the ocean and the show every time they encounter some new kind of animal.

484
00:46:55,580 --> 00:47:00,739
And then they explain like what the animal is like. But like the animals are bizarre, but they're actual animals.

485
00:47:00,740 --> 00:47:07,130
They did like the vampire squid. And one of the animals that they did was the mantis shrimp with a pesto shrimp.

486
00:47:07,220 --> 00:47:13,730
So it was like, Oh, my God, I know this one from the Orthodox. Yeah, well, my kids are older now, but when they were little,

487
00:47:16,010 --> 00:47:21,950
I remember I was the second year Masters in toxicology, I think also gave like multiple answers.

488
00:47:21,950 --> 00:47:26,380
But gastrointestinal system. Oh, my favorite science and.

489
00:47:27,230 --> 00:47:30,710
I think I also like the animals squids. All right.

490
00:47:33,470 --> 00:47:37,760
I am Jayson. I'm also a second year Masters Ecology student.

491
00:47:38,480 --> 00:47:46,370
I think I said, you know, reproductive system but I'm working in just I Islam so breast cancer also interested

492
00:47:46,370 --> 00:47:52,610
in the liver and I also gave very specific areas with the leatherback sea turtle.

493
00:47:54,280 --> 00:47:58,939
I worked with them for a few weeks. Long time ago.

494
00:47:58,940 --> 00:48:03,200
Many moons ago. That's right. They're very interesting creatures.

495
00:48:04,610 --> 00:48:16,180
All right. Well, that's one more second year DHS favorite system and different system for the animal surgeons.

496
00:48:16,220 --> 00:48:22,940
It's like we're going to have a no, I never had it.

497
00:48:24,680 --> 00:48:27,930
What, like buttery. I've heard it before. The audience.

498
00:48:28,700 --> 00:48:32,089
Yeah. All right. All right.

499
00:48:32,090 --> 00:48:37,790
Thanks, guys. Well, we have a lot a lot of people and a lot of endocrine and reproductive.

500
00:48:37,910 --> 00:48:43,399
Hopefully we can bring some of that in to our his symposium that all right it is so we are going

501
00:48:43,400 --> 00:48:49,550
to do some have today we're just going to do our intro to talk about it is now about ten or 11.

502
00:48:49,970 --> 00:48:56,090
So I say we take a little break and the lecture today is relatively light, so we should be able to finish on time.

503
00:48:56,090 --> 00:49:00,340
But let's take a little break, grab some water at our break and we're going to talk.

504
00:49:05,300 --> 00:49:12,470
So I don't really understand what's going on right there.

505
00:49:12,470 --> 00:49:16,730
You guys are. You know. I know, I know. I know. I know.

506
00:49:16,730 --> 00:49:21,830
You said it was break closer to 5 minutes or closer to 10 minutes.

507
00:49:24,100 --> 00:49:27,970
You needed to be closer to me because it's going to go grab a coffee from across the street.

508
00:49:28,270 --> 00:49:33,290
But it's. I think if I keep it, it's five to get out.

509
00:49:36,530 --> 00:49:43,180
John Lennon had said, I don't know what it is.

510
00:49:43,190 --> 00:49:49,030
I said I was going to take the family to help me or something like.

511
00:49:55,910 --> 00:50:07,290
And another Alzheimer's disease. Right. And that's exactly what I told, like I.

512
00:50:12,470 --> 00:50:15,500
So as I said, I don't know how.

513
00:50:19,410 --> 00:50:23,010
Yeah. I thought I was.

514
00:50:25,340 --> 00:50:28,660
I had won everything out.

515
00:50:28,930 --> 00:50:35,860
I Oh, my God. I don't know how I was when I left.

516
00:50:36,190 --> 00:50:40,170
I think so, yeah. Not really.

517
00:50:40,500 --> 00:50:47,549
I do find that close to a quarter.

518
00:50:47,550 --> 00:50:53,660
And, you know, we can check it out, but it should be like.

519
00:50:56,800 --> 00:51:02,740
Regarding Rudy Gobert. It's like it's got to be.

520
00:51:11,180 --> 00:51:18,900
I feel like you're like my daughter.

521
00:51:20,020 --> 00:51:25,510
And I don't know.

522
00:51:26,060 --> 00:51:30,120
I think I see my five year old.

523
00:51:30,540 --> 00:51:42,720
I mean, I know. In America we're going to have.

524
00:51:42,870 --> 00:51:46,190
Wow. Oh, it's so good.

525
00:51:46,550 --> 00:51:50,130
Like I said. Oh, I have a girl.

526
00:51:50,550 --> 00:51:55,700
So I got married right out of out of the top end of the world.

527
00:51:56,360 --> 00:52:03,170
Somehow it's been 25 years.

528
00:52:04,290 --> 00:52:12,000
And this is a very wonderful narrative.

529
00:52:12,650 --> 00:52:20,520
25 and a half million. So now I have to travel to take advantage of that.

530
00:52:21,180 --> 00:52:25,799
But everyone is together.

531
00:52:25,800 --> 00:52:30,660
And so. I don't know. No, no, no, no, no.

532
00:52:30,790 --> 00:52:38,940
And they actually do not have to answer any questions about it very easily, realizing that you just have to be able to say.

533
00:52:39,460 --> 00:52:47,610
Yeah, but it's like. That's just like the all star during England train or, you know, the Labor Department.

534
00:52:47,650 --> 00:53:03,850
That's probably worth. And at least one person along with you, someone who's got to keep your eye on the prize.

535
00:53:04,270 --> 00:53:08,700
Yeah, I don't think that things are getting any older.

536
00:53:12,160 --> 00:53:18,790
To somewhere there was country like the United States.

537
00:53:19,490 --> 00:53:35,580
I want. I think. Oh, yeah, I like that.

538
00:53:35,630 --> 00:53:43,350
Yeah. Okay. I like. You think that?

539
00:53:51,740 --> 00:53:54,930
Questions about the answer.

540
00:53:59,780 --> 00:54:05,870
I really don't. Yeah.

541
00:54:08,810 --> 00:54:24,150
Yeah. I know you guys have a great history, but I still believe that.

542
00:54:26,180 --> 00:54:30,380
Thanks to all.

543
00:54:34,870 --> 00:54:48,170
Like in my life, I really felt like I was an outsider and no one really felt like I had.

544
00:54:49,850 --> 00:54:59,510
During the 1999 Exxon Mobil.

545
00:55:12,360 --> 00:55:16,390
Yeah. Yeah. That's great. That sounds great.

546
00:55:20,240 --> 00:55:30,890
Yeah. Yeah, that sounded like.

547
00:55:32,930 --> 00:55:41,190
I dropped myself and I just stared there in that I learned something.

548
00:55:41,630 --> 00:55:48,130
I guess. I guess I to say that was really nice.

549
00:55:48,130 --> 00:55:56,850
Who's your favorite? Like, they were like, Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

550
00:55:59,450 --> 00:56:10,090
Like, I was like, oh, you.

551
00:56:12,950 --> 00:56:17,150
Yeah, I can.

552
00:56:17,210 --> 00:56:21,090
I can just be like, Oh, yeah.

553
00:56:21,440 --> 00:56:26,350
Yeah. Yeah.

554
00:56:32,480 --> 00:56:35,600
Oh, yeah. Yeah.

555
00:56:37,010 --> 00:56:47,540
All right, guys, go ahead and get started. I just sat there talking about what it was, like, 12 years ago.

556
00:56:49,250 --> 00:56:54,020
All right, guys, go ahead and get started again so we can get out of here on time.

557
00:56:54,110 --> 00:56:58,730
I know it's a big, long day, especially for those of you in the last couple of days.

558
00:57:00,380 --> 00:57:04,670
So I think we have everybody back, but we're trickling in if need be.

559
00:57:04,790 --> 00:57:12,080
So this is module one, which, like I said, is pretty much an overview to the context of toxicological pathology.

560
00:57:12,990 --> 00:57:19,310
Um, this is me, and I've already told you a little bit about my background, but kind of complete the story.

561
00:57:19,670 --> 00:57:23,600
I graduated a very long time ago. I'm originally from the East Coast.

562
00:57:23,600 --> 00:57:28,310
I'm from Massachusetts. And my background, back when I was an undergrad, I couldn't quite make up my mind.

563
00:57:28,340 --> 00:57:32,379
I've always loved animals, but science. I couldn't quite make up my mind about the practicalities.

564
00:57:32,380 --> 00:57:38,030
So I started as an animal science major. But I really like science and I like pathways and mechanisms.

565
00:57:38,030 --> 00:57:43,730
So I also started taking biochemistry courses but never could make up my mind.

566
00:57:43,740 --> 00:57:50,420
So I did a dual degree in biochemistry and animal science, and that kind of quandary of which do I like better is continued to this day.

567
00:57:50,510 --> 00:57:55,390
So I look at that and then I'm still kind of wrestling with what I want to do.

568
00:57:55,400 --> 00:57:58,520
I went to veterinary school at the University of Pennsylvania.

569
00:57:59,210 --> 00:58:06,080
UPenn is was the first veterinary school that organized itself on the medical school curriculum

570
00:58:06,440 --> 00:58:10,729
so that schools used to be coming out of schools that are agricultural institutions.

571
00:58:10,730 --> 00:58:12,710
So it was sort of like animal science plus,

572
00:58:13,280 --> 00:58:20,120
but then that was like new we to use the medical school format and there are some would say inordinately proud of this.

573
00:58:20,480 --> 00:58:27,440
So I have a backwards degree. Usually people who are vets have a DVM degree, I have a veterinary, I'm a decent eye doctor.

574
00:58:28,010 --> 00:58:33,680
And all that it means is you went to Penn, but people make fun of us for it because it's a little yeah,

575
00:58:33,800 --> 00:58:37,110
it's a pet thing, but it's the same thing as a DBA. Oops.

576
00:58:37,520 --> 00:58:40,440
And then after that, I'm still like, What am I gonna do?

577
00:58:40,540 --> 00:58:46,879
I got to be a pro practice, pharmacology, science, a happy medium that I thought I could go into lab animal medicine.

578
00:58:46,880 --> 00:58:52,070
So I went to Mickey to do a post-doc training in Alabama medicine.

579
00:58:52,520 --> 00:58:57,110
But while I was there, I also was in there. And then Department of Toxicology.

580
00:58:57,110 --> 00:59:04,490
Now I think it's called an environmental health something, but I got a masters in toxicology at MIT while I was there.

581
00:59:05,420 --> 00:59:06,950
So it was all kind of coming together.

582
00:59:07,790 --> 00:59:16,919
But my main or one of my main programs there was as a lab animal vet trainee, but my project for my master's was really very pathology focused.

583
00:59:16,920 --> 00:59:19,550
So I started really like pathology more at that time.

584
00:59:20,600 --> 00:59:25,489
And I, I like my minimal medicine, but it's very regulatory and I didn't want to only do regulatory stuff.

585
00:59:25,490 --> 00:59:28,730
So I was like, what to do, what to do? I like pathology, but I'm done with school.

586
00:59:29,150 --> 00:59:35,720
Forget it. I'm just going to do something else. So I took a little curlicue path and went into private practice veterinary medicine for a while,

587
00:59:36,500 --> 00:59:41,960
both in Massachusetts and then when we moved here to Michigan in small animal and exotic animal practice.

588
00:59:42,470 --> 00:59:47,030
And that turned out to be great. That taught me about how disease looks in the real world.

589
00:59:47,450 --> 00:59:54,859
Most importantly, it taught me, taught me how to make decisions in real time with limited information and with people who are under stress,

590
00:59:54,860 --> 00:59:58,999
which is an excellent life skill. So that was a great experience.

591
00:59:59,000 --> 01:00:08,649
But I always knew I wanted to kind of find my way back to science. So at some point I took my lab animal boards and said, I'm just going to do it,

592
01:00:08,650 --> 01:00:15,200
and went back and did a path residency up in Lansing at the veterinary school at Michigan State University.

593
01:00:16,010 --> 01:00:18,979
That is a very diagnostically focused residency.

594
01:00:18,980 --> 01:00:25,309
So they do diagnostic pathology for small animals, large animals and also zoo animals and some wildlife.

595
01:00:25,310 --> 01:00:29,480
So that was kind of great. You see a little bit kind of in real world environmental talks.

596
01:00:30,350 --> 01:00:34,489
They don't have much lab animal stuff, but I had already had that. At that point.

597
01:00:34,490 --> 01:00:39,590
I took my lab and my pathology boards and then I had to find some way to tie it all together.

598
01:00:40,520 --> 01:00:42,320
And it seemed to make sense.

599
01:00:42,340 --> 01:00:49,790
I ended up here in the unit for a lab animal medicine, as I said, which is the unit that provides veterinary care for the lab animals on campus.

600
01:00:50,180 --> 01:00:58,159
And my role there is to run our core lab, to provide research, pathology support, and also to serve the diagnostic functions for you.

601
01:00:58,160 --> 01:01:00,830
And so look at that. It all comes together.

602
01:01:00,830 --> 01:01:07,940
It's like I planned it, which I did not, but I'm just a little bit of background for you guys and a little bit of life advice.

603
01:01:07,940 --> 01:01:15,079
For those of you who are not quite sure what you want to do, just remember that everything that you do in your background helps you in the future,

604
01:01:15,080 --> 01:01:20,780
even if you're not working specifically in that field and that what you start doing doesn't have to be what you end up doing.

605
01:01:20,840 --> 01:01:26,840
So there are many pathways to take me. So what is toxicological pathology?

606
01:01:26,930 --> 01:01:37,190
What is in vivo toxicology? In vivo toxicology, you probably know in vivo toxicology is the study of toxicology and the whole system environment.

607
01:01:37,700 --> 01:01:44,269
So usually that means animal models and toxicology.

608
01:01:44,270 --> 01:01:50,420
Pathology is one aspect of toxicology, looking at the body response to injurious agents.

609
01:01:51,050 --> 01:01:58,420
So let's think about some broad definitions. Pathology broadly is the study of disease histology.

610
01:01:58,460 --> 01:02:01,940
So sometimes we use these terms in combination or interchangeably.

611
01:02:02,390 --> 01:02:09,590
Histology is the study of anatomy at the microscopic level, and usually it's at the tissue level.

612
01:02:10,730 --> 01:02:13,640
So once we start doing actual histology,

613
01:02:14,540 --> 01:02:21,409
one of the kind of classic tripping points for people who are coming from a molecular biology or a cell biology background is

614
01:02:21,410 --> 01:02:28,520
people want to zoom in to like a million X power and look at individual cells and like we do some high magnification work,

615
01:02:28,520 --> 01:02:34,940
but really histology and histopathology, which is the study of disease at the microscopic tissue level.

616
01:02:35,420 --> 01:02:38,330
Really, we're interested in what is happening in the whole tissue.

617
01:02:38,870 --> 01:02:44,540
Yes, we can see individual cells, but what's happening in this one cell is less relevant for the whole organism.

618
01:02:44,540 --> 01:02:52,490
That's what's happening in this entire tissue. So this is an example of some of the changes that we can see in Histopathology.

619
01:02:52,500 --> 01:02:56,930
So in the far right, it's a picture of normal breast tissue.

620
01:02:56,960 --> 01:03:04,890
So this is mammary gland tissue. And what we have done over here, what we have is the background, which is mostly white,

621
01:03:04,920 --> 01:03:09,530
that's kind of the stroma or the connective tissue support to the to the cells.

622
01:03:09,860 --> 01:03:14,540
And then we have these purply things which kind of form a ring and then there's something in the middle.

623
01:03:14,540 --> 01:03:18,350
It's very pink. The background is the connective tissue stroma,

624
01:03:18,650 --> 01:03:26,809
the purply things are the epithelial cells of the gland and the pink material in the middle of a secreted protein because it's mammary gland,

625
01:03:26,810 --> 01:03:29,510
the main proteins that they're secreting are the proteins in milk.

626
01:03:30,170 --> 01:03:34,579
So we'll learn next week when we talk about histology why some of these things are paying for

627
01:03:34,580 --> 01:03:38,580
some of these things are purple and how we can kind of recognize this different features.

628
01:03:39,170 --> 01:03:44,960
And then in pathology, we look this is the normal state or the baseline state you look at when things change.

629
01:03:45,500 --> 01:03:53,510
So in the next picture over, I mean, it basically kind of looks the same, but the purplish areas are thicker, like it's a thicker ring.

630
01:03:53,510 --> 01:04:01,100
The cells are kind of piling up on each other a little bit. There's maybe even a little bit less of the secreted material in the middle of a stroma.

631
01:04:01,100 --> 01:04:07,969
The background is a little bit thicker. This is the tissue that has some hyperplasia or an increased number of cells

632
01:04:07,970 --> 01:04:12,020
and a little bit of what's called dysplasia or an abnormal form to the tissue.

633
01:04:12,590 --> 01:04:21,920
So this is like a low grade in situ mammary, cancer tissue or memory tumor tissue, but not really forming a true cancer yet.

634
01:04:22,910 --> 01:04:28,550
This is often on the other side. Again, this is also mammary gland tissue.

635
01:04:29,090 --> 01:04:33,740
But you wouldn't recognize that if I didn't tell you that you can't see the glands anymore,

636
01:04:33,770 --> 01:04:37,759
but you have still those purplish cells, but now they're kind of doing whatever they want.

637
01:04:37,760 --> 01:04:43,070
They're from in blobs all over the tissue. They're kind of pushing into the adjacent connective tissue.

638
01:04:43,580 --> 01:04:48,920
So the same cells are there, but they've lost the normal restrictions on their growth.

639
01:04:49,520 --> 01:04:54,919
Okay, so molecularly these cells have disregulated proliferation.

640
01:04:54,920 --> 01:04:57,260
So this is cancer. This is memory cancer.

641
01:04:57,710 --> 01:05:04,820
And by our eye, what we see is a loss of the normal boundaries of the structures that we would expect in that tissue.

642
01:05:05,390 --> 01:05:09,260
Okay. So that's a kind of an overview of the types of changes we see in pathology.

643
01:05:09,920 --> 01:05:14,840
Don't worry, sometimes people freak out at this point, like I'd also say, I mean, don't worry about it.

644
01:05:15,410 --> 01:05:20,330
We're going to talk through histology next time. And all the histology I show in this class is pretty curated.

645
01:05:20,330 --> 01:05:27,470
Curated. I don't expect you to kind of know this either off the bat or even, you know, further.

646
01:05:27,890 --> 01:05:33,170
Okay. So toxicological pathology is a specific subtype of pathology,

647
01:05:33,170 --> 01:05:39,709
referring to those changes that result from exposure to an injurious biological compound.

648
01:05:39,710 --> 01:05:47,960
So that would be a toxin, a naturally occurring injurious agent or a non biological injurious compound, which would be a toxicant.

649
01:05:48,500 --> 01:05:52,520
So talks about integrates both toxicology and pathology.

650
01:05:54,650 --> 01:06:02,780
Okay. In vitro toxicology, I told you, is toxicity evaluated in a whole organism system that usually means animals.

651
01:06:03,440 --> 01:06:09,280
So there are some context in which you sometimes you often find in vivo talks.

652
01:06:09,290 --> 01:06:13,970
And one really common one is in the preclinical testing phase for pharmaceuticals.

653
01:06:14,720 --> 01:06:20,900
So those of you have taken an intro tox class or some other coursework might know that when pharmaceuticals are developed,

654
01:06:20,900 --> 01:06:29,060
there is a typical pipeline for their development. And at the earliest stages, after discovery, like after we've identified a compound,

655
01:06:29,420 --> 01:06:34,280
the earliest stages of that involve testing in animals to try to get a sense at what

656
01:06:34,310 --> 01:06:39,470
dose and that you might have adverse effects and what organ systems might be affected.

657
01:06:40,010 --> 01:06:46,819
So when people talk about preclinical testing, they're talking about testing in animals before an investigational compound is

658
01:06:46,820 --> 01:06:51,620
used in humans and human testing is known as clinical testing or clinical trials.

659
01:06:52,070 --> 01:07:00,020
So usually that happens fairly early in the developmental time period, but that's where talks have come in in pharmaceutical development.

660
01:07:00,920 --> 01:07:04,370
You also can hear it referred to as clinical testing.

661
01:07:04,580 --> 01:07:09,800
And this term, some people use it synonymously with preclinical testing, but kind of more traditionally,

662
01:07:10,160 --> 01:07:17,600
it's a term referring to testing in animals for compounds that may pose exposure risks to humans but aren't are pharmaceutical.

663
01:07:18,170 --> 01:07:27,270
So this here is a good example of that. So silica, as most of you know, is a compound that people can inhale, you know,

664
01:07:27,350 --> 01:07:34,290
during mining or operations that pose an inhalation or risk or rock dust or for mining dust.

665
01:07:34,850 --> 01:07:38,120
And this is an image of normal lung from an animal study.

666
01:07:38,450 --> 01:07:42,799
This is an image of normal lung. We're going to be one of the organ systems will do.

667
01:07:42,800 --> 01:07:48,770
But basically normal lung has sort of a honeycomb structure because all those open spaces are the alveoli where the air goes.

668
01:07:49,310 --> 01:07:57,080
And this is from an animal that's been exposed, inhalational lead to silica, where inflammatory cells come and fill in those airways spaces.

669
01:07:57,080 --> 01:08:00,650
And we have a proliferation or a change in the lining cells.

670
01:08:01,220 --> 01:08:05,690
So silica obviously isn't really used in that context as a pharmaceutical component.

671
01:08:06,050 --> 01:08:09,440
So testing in this context would be nonclinical testing.

672
01:08:12,020 --> 01:08:18,379
So the role of the toxicological pathologists in all this is this to specifically identify

673
01:08:18,380 --> 01:08:24,620
the changes in tissue that are associated with exposure to a toxin or a toxicant.

674
01:08:24,770 --> 01:08:28,340
So our job is to be people really on the microscope for the most part.

675
01:08:29,630 --> 01:08:33,470
But there are other aspects to pathology other than just looking at the microscope.

676
01:08:33,920 --> 01:08:38,610
So you might hear terms like gross pathology, which is kind of funny.

677
01:08:38,630 --> 01:08:42,650
My husband is an astronomer and he's he's all about the physical sciences.

678
01:08:42,660 --> 01:08:47,750
He thinks biology is kind of disgusting. So if I'm looking at slides like that, yeah, that is gross.

679
01:08:48,530 --> 01:08:53,300
But all that, it really means. Growth, pathologies, pathology, you can see with your unaided eye.

680
01:08:53,840 --> 01:08:57,799
So it would be if you're doing autopsy pathology or necropsy pathology,

681
01:08:57,800 --> 01:09:02,510
which is the word we use for autopsy in animals, things that you can see with your eye that are abnormal.

682
01:09:02,990 --> 01:09:10,990
So I'm just going to bring back a bone. So if you look at this top side for growth pathology, we have an organ here or a slice of an organ, rather.

683
01:09:11,000 --> 01:09:15,650
This is fixed. So will the change in appearance. This is the normal version of the organ.

684
01:09:16,310 --> 01:09:20,750
This is the same organ that has a little bit of a change. It has a yellow appearance to it.

685
01:09:20,750 --> 01:09:24,440
And if you were to with your gloved hand touch, that would be a little bit greasy feeling.

686
01:09:24,890 --> 01:09:29,420
And this is the same organ. The same organ. But this one looks very abnormal, right?

687
01:09:29,900 --> 01:09:34,580
It's kind of expanded. But some other areas are constricted, has a nodular surface.

688
01:09:35,990 --> 01:09:39,290
Does anyone have any guesses as to which organ this might be?

689
01:09:40,160 --> 01:09:44,149
Liver. It's the liver. Yes, it is. Well, can you guess?

690
01:09:44,150 --> 01:09:47,900
I told you this might be greasy and actually kind of soft to the touch. What may be going on here?

691
01:09:50,600 --> 01:09:55,999
I'm sorry. Fatty liver. Yeah, it's fat. So the grease in us is fat and histologically.

692
01:09:56,000 --> 01:10:02,690
We'll look at that later. We have fat that fuels infiltrating the cells and the fat is giving it that soft, greasy consistency.

693
01:10:02,990 --> 01:10:07,330
And there are conditions like fatty liver disease that would look like this.

694
01:10:07,340 --> 01:10:13,969
What's going on here? So necrosis necrosis is the word that means cell death.

695
01:10:13,970 --> 01:10:17,990
That's an excellent. Yes. And there are definitely probably areas of necrosis in this.

696
01:10:17,990 --> 01:10:22,250
Tissue necrosis is cell death. It's a something lost lesion.

697
01:10:22,580 --> 01:10:28,970
So it takes tissue away as the cells die. And then remember our sequence, cell injury, free response.

698
01:10:29,360 --> 01:10:36,170
If you have ongoing cell death, you then have to have a response to the body's going to try to regenerate that area.

699
01:10:36,230 --> 01:10:39,410
Or if the damage is too severe, it's kind of scar it down.

700
01:10:40,310 --> 01:10:50,150
So the reason this is so nodular is because you actually have areas of cell loss, cell death and inflammation and response and scarring.

701
01:10:50,150 --> 01:10:53,750
So you have little areas that are tacked down and it's forming. Nodules.

702
01:10:54,170 --> 01:10:59,000
This is what that area looks like. Histologically. This is liver.

703
01:10:59,990 --> 01:11:06,320
This is scarring. So the scarring is taking down the pieces of liver, creating these little nodules.

704
01:11:06,740 --> 01:11:13,940
That's what you're seeing with the eye. And then the overall process, this is a liver that has suffered repeated episodes of chronic injury.

705
01:11:14,210 --> 01:11:19,900
So the tissue is always in your repair fix and the repair fix and keep doing it and doing it and doing it.

706
01:11:19,940 --> 01:11:24,230
And this is the end result of that. And so we said this is liver.

707
01:11:24,240 --> 01:11:34,040
So I'll tell you, this is the response that you can get if you have a person chronically exposed to things like alcohol, or if they had a hepatitis,

708
01:11:34,040 --> 01:11:36,590
like a viral injury and they've had chronic liver damage,

709
01:11:37,070 --> 01:11:44,110
they would know that critical medical word for if you have a liver damage chronically like from alcoholism, cirrhosis, the risk of this.

710
01:11:44,120 --> 01:11:49,579
Yeah. So this look at you're doing that audio written like the first day the first one cirrhosis that's

711
01:11:49,580 --> 01:11:54,490
the gross appearance to cirrhosis and already showed you this is the microscopic appearance.

712
01:11:54,500 --> 01:11:58,069
So we're going to try to learn to correlate those and then we're not going to it now.

713
01:11:58,070 --> 01:11:59,840
But if we were to go one step back further,

714
01:12:00,020 --> 01:12:08,000
we would think about biochemically what's happening to cause that person's history path or microscopic pathology, anything, really.

715
01:12:08,930 --> 01:12:11,810
We also have a term called clinical pathology,

716
01:12:12,980 --> 01:12:19,940
which refers to pathology from stuff that you don't need to take a tissue or an organ out of a person in order to look at it.

717
01:12:20,120 --> 01:12:24,870
So it's often used in the live patient as a pilot to detect biomarkers of change.

718
01:12:25,340 --> 01:12:31,700
So those with things like hematology, if you're looking at complete blood counts to see if when cell counts are up or to see if

719
01:12:31,700 --> 01:12:38,209
a person's anemic clinical chemistry is like an enzyme secretion in serum urinalysis,

720
01:12:38,210 --> 01:12:44,900
things like that. That's clinical pathology, and that's another adjunct that we use in Talkspace to complement these areas.

721
01:12:45,180 --> 01:12:51,740
Okay. And then finally, you can also use molecular particle pathology, which can be of many different levels.

722
01:12:51,770 --> 01:12:59,149
You can detect the presence of particular prognostic markers like maybe you want to see in a breast tumor whether

723
01:12:59,150 --> 01:13:05,120
you have estrogen receptors or progesterone receptors or whether there's the presence of the her to molecule.

724
01:13:05,480 --> 01:13:10,070
Because all of these have a different impact on the prognosis for a person who suffers from

725
01:13:10,070 --> 01:13:15,770
breast cancer and can also determine whether a particular treatment is going to be effective.

726
01:13:16,070 --> 01:13:21,710
Effective. So, you know, if there are certain treatments that involve interfering with overexpression of her two,

727
01:13:22,040 --> 01:13:26,480
but a person does not have a HER2 positive breast tumor, that's not going to be effective for them.

728
01:13:26,900 --> 01:13:33,230
So there are molecular markers. This is immunohistochemistry, which is an immunologic way of detecting expression of tissue.

729
01:13:33,680 --> 01:13:39,590
There's also sequencing methods that people use, but this is another sort of adjunct.

730
01:13:39,650 --> 01:13:44,630
So all of pathology is not just looking at this. It's using all that information in context.

731
01:13:45,110 --> 01:13:52,130
And different people have different sort of areas of specialty. So in tox path and in diagnostic path, at this point,

732
01:13:52,550 --> 01:14:00,320
the movement is not is to really integrate all this information into a multimodal approach so that you can use all the

733
01:14:00,320 --> 01:14:07,130
information at your disposal to make decisions either diagnostically or when you're looking at the mechanism of toxic injury.

734
01:14:07,580 --> 01:14:11,330
So that's our pathology toolbox. So who are these people?

735
01:14:12,290 --> 01:14:16,820
So Talkspace, I already told you, is really common in a regulatory setting.

736
01:14:18,410 --> 01:14:22,280
So that could be in the pharma industry in something called Zero's,

737
01:14:22,280 --> 01:14:31,490
which are contract research organizations which perform or contracted out to perform the preclinical testing for a compounded development.

738
01:14:32,000 --> 01:14:35,330
And then we also have regulatory talks passed in the setting of the government.

739
01:14:36,380 --> 01:14:45,590
So at the FDA level, things like the national toxicology program, looking at the effect of compounds in an individual setting.

740
01:14:46,190 --> 01:14:52,160
So pathologists who work in any of those regulatory settings are actually interestingly usually veterinary pathologists,

741
01:14:52,460 --> 01:14:58,970
because most of the time that's involving the use of animal models and venerate pathologists have a broad background in comparative pathology.

742
01:14:59,510 --> 01:15:06,230
There are some M.D. pathologists working in that arena, but most of the time they're usually more clinically focused.

743
01:15:06,470 --> 01:15:10,970
The vast majority of regular regulatory tax payer folks have a veterinary background.

744
01:15:11,270 --> 01:15:17,100
Interesting. Another setting for talks path is experimental.

745
01:15:17,280 --> 01:15:25,390
It's kind of what we do here. That can be in an academic setting here or in the discovery arm of a pharmaceutical company.

746
01:15:25,420 --> 01:15:31,770
So before all the regulatory stuff, if you're trying to identify potential compounds, there are some research institutes that do this work.

747
01:15:32,190 --> 01:15:36,060
Again, a lot of the people working in that area are veterinary pathologists,

748
01:15:36,210 --> 01:15:41,700
some M.D. pathologists and then toxicologists and other biomedical scientists.

749
01:15:42,330 --> 01:15:50,370
So in research, in experimental work, many people are doing pathology who are not a pathologist per say,

750
01:15:50,580 --> 01:15:53,320
but usually they're focused on a pretty specific system.

751
01:15:53,340 --> 01:16:01,110
So they're like an expert in, I don't know, the immune system, but less sort of broadly trained than a certified pathologist.

752
01:16:02,130 --> 01:16:07,140
As far as qualifications, some of the common things that you'll see for toxicology pathologists.

753
01:16:07,170 --> 01:16:14,160
Like I said, many of them are veterinary pathologists. We have the college that we have that certifies veterinary pathologists.

754
01:16:14,670 --> 01:16:17,940
CBP or the American College of Veterinary Pathology.

755
01:16:18,390 --> 01:16:24,040
It's actually the second oldest board specialty organization in veterinary medicine.

756
01:16:24,090 --> 01:16:30,959
The first oldest was the public health veterinarians, which actually doesn't exist as a board specialty anymore.

757
01:16:30,960 --> 01:16:33,870
But some of the lab animal medicines of sort of taking up that mantle.

758
01:16:34,230 --> 01:16:39,120
But anyway, so there's a pretty rigorous exam that people have to take to call themselves a diplomat.

759
01:16:39,120 --> 01:16:43,770
But CBP is the qualification that most people certainly working in regulatory pap have.

760
01:16:44,310 --> 01:16:52,140
There's also an organization called the Society of Talks Path, which is kind of a subspecialty of veterinary pathologists working in Talkspace.

761
01:16:52,530 --> 01:17:00,389
I'm an active member of that organization. And then there are a couple other qualifications that you sometimes see about those of you in talks.

762
01:17:00,390 --> 01:17:01,850
Probably know that organization.

763
01:17:01,860 --> 01:17:08,069
There's a lot of overlap in the training between veteran pathologists and what people who are studying for that board takes.

764
01:17:08,070 --> 01:17:12,530
A lot of people also have an empty board. And then there's sort of an international organization.

765
01:17:12,800 --> 01:17:15,840
It's kind of the international equivalent of the society for talks about.

766
01:17:16,230 --> 01:17:20,100
So those are some of the acronyms that you'll see kind of explains the people's background.

767
01:17:21,690 --> 01:17:26,129
And then the other interesting thing about if you look at somebody who's a

768
01:17:26,130 --> 01:17:30,540
pathologist working in diagnostic setting versus experimental or toxicology,

769
01:17:30,900 --> 01:17:37,710
is they talk differently and there's a purpose for it. They talk differently, which is frustrating to describe the same thing.

770
01:17:37,920 --> 01:17:42,330
So that can sometimes drive people looking from the outside crazy, but there's a reason for it.

771
01:17:42,990 --> 01:17:47,970
So here's an example. I should like asked you what this was, but here is in long again.

772
01:17:48,360 --> 01:17:53,880
So there's the background honeycomb stuff. That's the alveoli, the little air sacs where gas exchange takes place.

773
01:17:54,270 --> 01:17:58,589
And then there's this larger space that has a lining and has white in the middle.

774
01:17:58,590 --> 01:18:02,310
So there's air in that. That's an airway. So that's a bronchial.

775
01:18:02,600 --> 01:18:06,450
Okay, so there's the highway, which is the airway, and then the side of gas exchange.

776
01:18:06,960 --> 01:18:10,620
And here we have a hours long. This is the same highway, right?

777
01:18:10,620 --> 01:18:15,719
The same thing. But there is no more space. Air can't get in here because we have all these little cells.

778
01:18:15,720 --> 01:18:19,500
This is the little mag shots. You can't really see the cells except in aggregate.

779
01:18:19,890 --> 01:18:24,030
But there's all these cells sort of filling this airway. These are all inflammatory cells.

780
01:18:24,450 --> 01:18:29,040
So this is an inflamed mouse lung and a diagnostic pathology.

781
01:18:29,400 --> 01:18:35,550
We would say, okay, we have a special word for inflammation in the lung, which we use as pneumonia.

782
01:18:36,030 --> 01:18:43,500
And this type of inflammation is centered on the airway, the bronchioles or the bronchi her further up.

783
01:18:43,510 --> 01:18:51,600
So this is a broncho pneumonia. So clinical pathologist would know that that means inflammation area in the lungs centered on the airway.

784
01:18:51,990 --> 01:18:58,200
Usually that's because of an inhaled agent like a virus or a bacteria.

785
01:18:58,980 --> 01:19:04,980
But the focus in diagnostic pathology is to identify a specific condition because you're going to say,

786
01:19:04,980 --> 01:19:09,240
oh, okay, bacterial broncho pneumonia, I need to give an antibiotic, cigaret one antibiotic to give.

787
01:19:09,540 --> 01:19:15,180
So the focus is interpretive if you want to identify a specific condition to guide your treatment and prognosis.

788
01:19:15,660 --> 01:19:20,610
So the focus in diagnostic pathology is only individual right. You want to figure out what's wrong with that particular person.

789
01:19:22,140 --> 01:19:28,320
In terms pathology, the focus is on the group. You're not interested so much on what's happening in that one individual mouse.

790
01:19:28,320 --> 01:19:32,670
You want to know when I expose mice to this compound, what happens in the aggregate?

791
01:19:32,670 --> 01:19:35,670
What's the common lesions that I might see associated?

792
01:19:36,420 --> 01:19:40,110
And when a clinical pathologist says Broncho pneumonia.

793
01:19:40,110 --> 01:19:45,689
If I'm a physician and I get that report back from the pathologist, they're going to go, oh, skin ammonia.

794
01:19:45,690 --> 01:19:52,379
And then 100 things are going to run through their head as common causes of broncho pneumonia for person in tox path.

795
01:19:52,380 --> 01:19:58,440
We don't necessarily always know the mechanisms and we confine our interpretation really to what we see.

796
01:19:58,740 --> 01:20:07,590
So the terminology is much more descriptive and less interpretive, because all you want to convey is to the person is what you see.

797
01:20:08,040 --> 01:20:12,810
So this same lesion in Talkspace, you know that this is inflammation.

798
01:20:13,500 --> 01:20:17,489
He'd say what it is. It's long, it's inflammation, it's in the bronchi.

799
01:20:17,490 --> 01:20:20,910
So I'd say bronchial her. And what kind of inflammation is it?

800
01:20:20,970 --> 01:20:24,390
You can't see that from here, but it's neutrophil, which usually means it's acute.

801
01:20:25,200 --> 01:20:29,430
So the toxicologist or the biomedical scientist or regulator reading this

802
01:20:29,850 --> 01:20:33,830
doesn't have to know all this specialized terminology or unfamiliar with that.

803
01:20:33,840 --> 01:20:41,730
I don't know. All they have to know is, oh, the pathologist saw inflammation in the bronchi and it was neutrophil like or acute inflammation.

804
01:20:42,240 --> 01:20:45,030
So it's much more straightforward and just descriptive.

805
01:20:45,330 --> 01:20:51,300
And then that information and all the other stuff from the study is going to be used to build like a pathogenesis well,

806
01:20:51,390 --> 01:20:54,330
if that's the focus of it, to build a pathogenesis of what's happening.

807
01:20:54,870 --> 01:21:03,420
So talks about this descriptive diagnostic is interpretive and that's going to help you guys because since we're doing talkspace,

808
01:21:03,750 --> 01:21:08,790
you don't have to learn all the gibberish, the lingo of diagnostic pathology.

809
01:21:09,510 --> 01:21:14,010
All you have to do is recognize inflammation. And then we're going to just keep using that liver inflammation.

810
01:21:14,100 --> 01:21:19,680
And then where it is lung inflammation, where it is, so it's much more simple to read and understand.

811
01:21:20,700 --> 01:21:22,409
And then finally, experimental path,

812
01:21:22,410 --> 01:21:30,390
which is sort of the experimental arm of really any of either toxicology or any basic science, has sort of a mixture of both.

813
01:21:30,450 --> 01:21:36,329
It kind of depends with the focus of your study is if you're doing tox stuff or you're trying to generate a mechanism,

814
01:21:36,330 --> 01:21:40,140
it behooves you to stick with descriptive because you're using it to build a story.

815
01:21:40,590 --> 01:21:47,309
If you're trying to make an animal model of a particular disease, you're trying to replicate the pathology you see in that human disease.

816
01:21:47,310 --> 01:21:50,130
You might use the human terminology a little bit of a mix.

817
01:21:50,580 --> 01:21:58,710
And that is why in literature you can see all the frustrating different names of different nomenclature for the same agent, same condition.

818
01:21:59,700 --> 01:22:06,630
That gets a little confusing in talks past. We actually have regulatory standards that are set for the particular words we use.

819
01:22:07,020 --> 01:22:11,640
So if you're a toxicologist working in industry, it's a little easier and we're more consistent.

820
01:22:13,140 --> 01:22:18,120
Remember that pathology itself is only one aspect of toxicology investigation.

821
01:22:18,150 --> 01:22:22,830
So for those of you in the talks probe program, your job is toxicologists.

822
01:22:22,830 --> 01:22:27,780
Much broader than my job as the pathologist. So if you have one, this is all figured out.

823
01:22:28,140 --> 01:22:32,850
If you have one animal study, this is kind of the pathologist job.

824
01:22:33,120 --> 01:22:37,949
And then the toxicologist takes all the information, especially nowadays.

825
01:22:37,950 --> 01:22:41,730
A lot of times they're going to be having some big data information like some omics.

826
01:22:42,300 --> 01:22:47,400
So you have an animal, you give it a compound. The pathologist says these are the findings that we have.

827
01:22:47,760 --> 01:22:52,980
And then you can look at like the expression data and from there kind of iterate her way.

828
01:22:53,010 --> 01:23:01,050
Okay. If we know that this condition or this compound causes inflammation in the nervous system of a mouse or about a human,

829
01:23:01,770 --> 01:23:06,300
what are the expression or the the molecular changes that underlie that change?

830
01:23:06,780 --> 01:23:12,750
So toxicology is much more iterative, are much more comprehensive, and pathology is only one aspect of it.

831
01:23:14,330 --> 01:23:21,440
Okay. So going back to talk, what is the focus of most talks investigations?

832
01:23:22,100 --> 01:23:30,409
Because this is also borrowed from a clinical pathologist called Robert Hall, who has an article that is called basically this is it real?

833
01:23:30,410 --> 01:23:37,820
Is it bad? Is it real bad? And what he's trying to get at is the focus of taxpayers first is to determine if there's a lesion.

834
01:23:38,510 --> 01:23:43,159
And when you start to do like I have very curated examples for you, but when you look at real tissues,

835
01:23:43,160 --> 01:23:49,850
you'll realize there's a lot of artifact that can come into play and that can fool you and make you think that you're seeing something real.

836
01:23:49,850 --> 01:23:56,840
That's a biologically relevant change when really it's an artifact of preparation or something incidental and unrelated.

837
01:23:57,980 --> 01:24:01,940
So the first question that pathologists always asks themselves is, is it real?

838
01:24:02,090 --> 01:24:11,629
So you have to learn to interpret real lesions versus artifact and things that are compound related versus vehicle related.

839
01:24:11,630 --> 01:24:15,530
So there can be changes just with a vehicle or something that's just background.

840
01:24:16,280 --> 01:24:21,320
So a good example of background is sometimes we have compounds were given to mice by oral device,

841
01:24:21,380 --> 01:24:24,800
which is where you put a little to that and deliver it directly to the stomach of the mouse.

842
01:24:25,520 --> 01:24:33,970
And, you know, there's specific ways of doing it, but sometimes despite the best care, there can be inadvertent injury caused by the Gavage needle.

843
01:24:34,400 --> 01:24:38,570
So you might see a lesion like in the esophagus or something that's pretty inflamed,

844
01:24:38,930 --> 01:24:44,180
but you have to be able to recognize that and that has nothing to do with your actual compound.

845
01:24:44,300 --> 01:24:51,020
So learning to recognize background is a huge part of the pathologist job and learning to recognize real lesions.

846
01:24:51,530 --> 01:24:56,170
This is kidney. These are tubules of the kidney. This is a normal I'm going to kind of trace the tubule.

847
01:24:56,180 --> 01:25:05,809
This is a normal tubule where the kind of local naja cuboid epithelium that have little microbes on the surface.

848
01:25:05,810 --> 01:25:12,500
And then there's a tubule, lumen, which you can't see entirely here, but these are nice, big happy cells and large nuclei.

849
01:25:13,250 --> 01:25:17,660
This is an animal that's been exposed to a toxicant and this is a tubule.

850
01:25:17,670 --> 01:25:24,230
But you'll notice now most of the nuclei, these purple balls are gone and everything's very pink.

851
01:25:24,380 --> 01:25:28,580
This is necrosis or cell death. We learn why everything works that way.

852
01:25:28,930 --> 01:25:32,450
We do cell injury. This also doesn't look quite right,

853
01:25:32,480 --> 01:25:43,010
but this is the ptosis auto meaning self lysis meaning like bursting a tell us this is what happens to tissue after death unless it is fixed,

854
01:25:43,160 --> 01:25:45,290
unless the proteins are cross-linked in the tissue.

855
01:25:46,400 --> 01:25:53,750
So if at crop, if the animal was found dead and it wasn't necropsy in a timely manner, if it wasn't fixed in a timely manner,

856
01:25:53,750 --> 01:25:59,360
you can have huge amounts of oral with a change which look like something's horribly wrong with the tissue that's just backwards.

857
01:26:00,020 --> 01:26:05,089
So learning to recognize those things is a huge focus and being able to do that accurately.

858
01:26:05,090 --> 01:26:13,760
And I will tell you in the experimental literature, there are a ton of things, the experimental literature that are not real pathology,

859
01:26:13,760 --> 01:26:19,399
that are just artifact, because there aren't that many pathologists and sometimes that knowledge is hard to come by.

860
01:26:19,400 --> 01:26:25,410
So gotta be a little cautious in addition to identifying whether a lesion is real or not.

861
01:26:25,430 --> 01:26:33,240
One one thing that you need to identify is, is it bad because the body exists in a dynamic state with its environment.

862
01:26:33,260 --> 01:26:37,940
And when you give a compound, even a innocuous compound, things are going to happen.

863
01:26:37,940 --> 01:26:43,160
So the body's going to adapt in order to maintain a homeostatic state with its environment.

864
01:26:43,700 --> 01:26:47,690
So change different from baseline is not necessarily bad.

865
01:26:48,170 --> 01:26:55,730
And one of the major jobs of the talks pathologists like an industry in preclinical testing is say, okay, I identified this change.

866
01:26:56,480 --> 01:27:02,330
Is it adverse? So like, if you go to a 30 and go to anything related to pathology at a social,

867
01:27:02,400 --> 01:27:07,160
you'll hear people talking about defining adversity, which is a lot harder than we think.

868
01:27:08,090 --> 01:27:11,750
But when our main job is to decide, is a given change adverse?

869
01:27:11,960 --> 01:27:17,930
Because obviously, from a toxicity standpoint, if something is bad, if something is adverse, that's what we want to be concerned about.

870
01:27:19,010 --> 01:27:22,070
And then finally, if it is adverse, okay, it's bad.

871
01:27:22,370 --> 01:27:29,750
How bad is it? So you might have a compound intended for as a chemotherapeutic, right?

872
01:27:30,050 --> 01:27:33,290
So it's going to kill rapidly progressing cells like cancer cells.

873
01:27:34,070 --> 01:27:37,800
But cancer cells are not the only rapidly progressing cells in the body.

874
01:27:37,850 --> 01:27:40,790
Right. There are also blood cells. There are cells of the GI tract.

875
01:27:41,270 --> 01:27:47,120
So one of the adverse effects of a chemotherapeutic is often cause low level destruction

876
01:27:47,420 --> 01:27:51,650
of the crypt cells in the intestine or destruction of cells in the bone marrow.

877
01:27:52,410 --> 01:27:56,180
They might see anemia. You might see decreases in white blood cells.

878
01:27:56,180 --> 01:27:59,209
You might see GI bleeding or other GI disturbance.

879
01:27:59,210 --> 01:28:08,780
Those are those are adverse changes. But the level of badness is what you kind of need to assess when you think about compounds for human use,

880
01:28:08,780 --> 01:28:13,460
like we know this is going to happen, but we're doing this because we want to kill the really rapidly.

881
01:28:13,790 --> 01:28:19,540
Think cells, which are the cancer cells. So you also get into something like severity scoring, which can be problematic.

882
01:28:19,550 --> 01:28:26,180
But that's kind of the third level of assessment in terms of talks about one important

883
01:28:26,180 --> 01:28:31,070
thing to remember is that the interpretations are made in the context of the study.

884
01:28:31,670 --> 01:28:39,380
So when I'm looking at a study of rats, my assessment of is this change at birth is only going to be phrased as,

885
01:28:39,410 --> 01:28:47,720
you know, Compound X was given to rats at a dose of whatever for X number of days and adverse changes in this study were.

886
01:28:48,320 --> 01:28:55,460
So I'm interpreting what are the adverse changes for the rat for that compound at the dose level at which I used?

887
01:28:56,030 --> 01:29:01,400
I'm not saying as the pathologist that this means this compound will cause the same change in humans.

888
01:29:02,150 --> 01:29:06,560
That is an assessment that has to be made later in the context of all the data.

889
01:29:07,040 --> 01:29:14,030
So maybe you have a rat study and even have a monkey study and you have biochemical evidence and pharmacokinetic pharmacokinetics.

890
01:29:14,570 --> 01:29:19,940
That extrapolation to humans is a broader decision that happens after the pathologist's job.

891
01:29:20,570 --> 01:29:30,370
So pathologists may be involved, but you can never really accurately say, okay, I gave this compound to a rat and the rats got a kidney to process.

892
01:29:30,380 --> 01:29:33,530
Therefore, humans are going to get kidney necrosis. It's not that simple.

893
01:29:34,190 --> 01:29:38,750
So again, talks about this little bit narrower focus and toxicology assessment as a whole.

894
01:29:40,640 --> 01:29:47,930
Okay. So we've talked about toxicology pathology in the context of pre-clinical testing and also in experimental work.

895
01:29:48,530 --> 01:29:53,630
All of this is predicated essentially on two basic premises.

896
01:29:54,180 --> 01:29:59,210
So this might be things you've heard of where they're kind of some basic principles of in vivo toxicology.

897
01:29:59,870 --> 01:30:04,910
And one is that toxicant induced effects in lab animals are applicable to humans.

898
01:30:05,690 --> 01:30:09,800
So you might already have some. Well, what about this questions about that one.

899
01:30:10,250 --> 01:30:17,540
And the other is that exposure of animals in high doses is a necessary and valid means of determining potential.

900
01:30:18,080 --> 01:30:22,280
That word is key. Human hazards. So what do I mean by this?

901
01:30:23,510 --> 01:30:28,040
Well, the first one that toxicant induced effects in lab animals are applicable to humans.

902
01:30:28,640 --> 01:30:34,040
I mean, intuitively, hopefully that's true to some degree. Or there would be no point in in vivo toxicology.

903
01:30:34,790 --> 01:30:39,050
But one supporting piece of information is that all known human carcinogens.

904
01:30:39,530 --> 01:30:47,030
So everything that we know of that acts as a carcinogen in humans has been found to be carcinogenic in at least one species of animal.

905
01:30:47,600 --> 01:30:52,700
Okay. So all known human carcinogens are carcinogenic in at least one species of animal.

906
01:30:53,060 --> 01:31:00,950
So there is an appropriate animal model, not necessarily the same one, but there's an appropriate animal model for each known carcinogen.

907
01:31:01,490 --> 01:31:09,410
But the converse is not true. Not true. Not all animal carcinogens survive something that I know causes cancer in a rat.

908
01:31:09,860 --> 01:31:12,980
Not all animal personages are carcinogenic in humans.

909
01:31:14,060 --> 01:31:21,960
So essentially what that means is that a human is not a sort of universal model for animal skins.

910
01:31:22,550 --> 01:31:27,650
The key is that certain species have commonalities in their toxic pathways.

911
01:31:27,860 --> 01:31:31,760
So maybe for a given compound, Iraq and a human will respond the same way.

912
01:31:32,120 --> 01:31:36,960
And therefore the rat is a good model for the human. But for another species, I don't know.

913
01:31:36,980 --> 01:31:40,130
Pick something. A dog and a human might respond differently.

914
01:31:40,580 --> 01:31:44,390
And the differences have many potential causes.

915
01:31:44,570 --> 01:31:49,670
It might be a different absorption sea of animals that are functionally different,

916
01:31:49,670 --> 01:31:53,330
like ruminants have a for stomach, but it contains a lot of bacteria.

917
01:31:53,870 --> 01:31:59,899
And so the bacteria can break down compound compounds that another simple stomached animal would not be able to break down.

918
01:31:59,900 --> 01:32:03,860
So maybe there's an anatomic or a physiologic reason for differences.

919
01:32:04,970 --> 01:32:12,830
You can have dose differences. So if I know that a compound is toxic in a human at X minutes per kid,

920
01:32:13,400 --> 01:32:19,490
I can't just extrapolate down that the same dose of x megs per take in a mouse will be toxic.

921
01:32:20,000 --> 01:32:24,470
Because as you probably know from the other classes, not all dose relationships are linear.

922
01:32:24,980 --> 01:32:28,940
And in fact there are many compounds where the dosing is based on surface area.

923
01:32:29,480 --> 01:32:40,070
And the net effect is that for a small animals, the dose to have a given response is often much, much larger than the dose in a larger animal.

924
01:32:40,850 --> 01:32:44,820
So resveratrol is a good example for that.

925
01:32:44,900 --> 01:32:50,330
Resveratrol is a compound in red wine that has antioxidant capacity.

926
01:32:50,330 --> 01:32:54,920
And some people felt that it was had some anti-Christian eugenic capacity.

927
01:32:55,850 --> 01:33:00,350
But its antioxidant capacity is what it's known by. And that was based on animal studies in mice.

928
01:33:01,160 --> 01:33:04,610
Of dosing resveratrol at a huge dose.

929
01:33:05,120 --> 01:33:09,319
The equivalent if you were to take the amount of resveratrol in red wine, I mean,

930
01:33:09,320 --> 01:33:13,460
you'd have to be like swigging red wine all day at a considerable amount.

931
01:33:13,920 --> 01:33:18,930
Um, so that was, you know, that extrapolation is not one on one.

932
01:33:19,440 --> 01:33:28,710
But as it turns out, the dose necessary to have an antioxidant response in the human is actually lower on a big per cake basis.

933
01:33:29,160 --> 01:33:36,240
Because for an animal that that's tiny, there's sort of surface area or related to mass is often much greater.

934
01:33:36,660 --> 01:33:44,670
So there are some dose relationships that are better estimated using elemental metric scaling, which is a dose estimate based on body surface area.

935
01:33:45,690 --> 01:33:52,710
So it can be hard to figure those things out, but just knowing that there are differences in dose and then there are also differences in metabolism.

936
01:33:53,250 --> 01:33:56,270
So that might relate to p450 isoform differences.

937
01:33:56,280 --> 01:33:59,910
Maybe drugs are broken down quicker or slower than others in different species.

938
01:34:00,390 --> 01:34:04,469
Or there can be different expression of molecular targets like receptors on certain

939
01:34:04,470 --> 01:34:08,670
cells that are targeted by the drug have a different level of expression across species.

940
01:34:09,480 --> 01:34:12,540
So it's not so simple as the. Oh, yeah, go ahead.

941
01:34:13,320 --> 01:34:19,430
I'm just curious, like, if you figured out that the humans need like basically less dosage for you for getting.

942
01:34:19,610 --> 01:34:23,129
Yeah. How would you do that? Would you just have to test in humans then?

943
01:34:23,130 --> 01:34:28,440
Because you already did then, you know, so there's actually extrapolation.

944
01:34:28,450 --> 01:34:32,640
So if you establish and then in the lab class, we go into this a little more detail,

945
01:34:32,910 --> 01:34:38,490
but if you do a study in rats and you establish that they no observed adverse effect level,

946
01:34:39,000 --> 01:34:42,720
so the level at which you dose that compound at which you see no effect.

947
01:34:42,990 --> 01:34:47,130
So maybe above that you see adverse effects, but at this level it's safe in rats.

948
01:34:48,360 --> 01:34:52,709
You can extrapolate there are calculations that you can use to extrapolate that

949
01:34:52,710 --> 01:34:57,750
dose either on an L metric base or a linear base to the human equivalent dose.

950
01:34:58,350 --> 01:35:05,550
So the first thing you do is you take what ten makes per kig and extrapolate that to the human equivalent dose using our metrics or linear scaling.

951
01:35:06,090 --> 01:35:08,400
And then you apply a safety factor to that.

952
01:35:08,880 --> 01:35:16,590
And so what you're estimating is like, okay, if the rat is a physiologically relevant species and I apply these extrapolations,

953
01:35:16,590 --> 01:35:23,909
I think the equivalent human dose will be this. And then you make a decision based on how confident you are that the rat is a

954
01:35:23,910 --> 01:35:28,230
good model species and the information that you have maybe from another species,

955
01:35:28,590 --> 01:35:32,220
because for pharmaceuticals you usually have to test them in at least two different species.

956
01:35:32,940 --> 01:35:38,730
And for your clinical trials in humans, you could decide, okay, well the rat is the most relevant.

957
01:35:39,120 --> 01:35:45,330
So after applying my safety factor, I'm going to use the HDL from the rat as my starting dose for human clinical trials.

958
01:35:45,840 --> 01:35:47,480
Or you're going to say, Well, I'm not really sure here.

959
01:35:47,880 --> 01:35:53,160
So we'll look at all the information I have and apply the lowest dose as my starting dose for the human clinical trials.

960
01:35:53,760 --> 01:35:58,800
So it's kind of a computational method and an extrapolation based on all the information.

961
01:35:59,760 --> 01:36:05,520
We go into that a little bit more in the lab class, but there is still some level of uncertainty,

962
01:36:05,520 --> 01:36:10,319
and that's where a lot of the conflict and controversy comes into play when you're using animals

963
01:36:10,320 --> 01:36:14,700
as models for humans because you don't always have all the information you need to extrapolate.

964
01:36:15,010 --> 01:36:20,970
That's an excellent question. Unfortunately, it's sort of a lifetime's worth of figuring out to truly answer that question.

965
01:36:22,680 --> 01:36:26,340
Okay. That was relevance of animals to humans.

966
01:36:26,670 --> 01:36:33,630
The other point was exposure of animals in high doses is a necessary and valid means of determining potential human hazards.

967
01:36:34,290 --> 01:36:41,640
And the thing to remember here is that the purpose of tox testing is to characterize the potential toxic effects,

968
01:36:42,060 --> 01:36:46,320
not to demonstrate that definitively that a compound is safe.

969
01:36:47,040 --> 01:36:52,290
And that's based on the idea that essentially all compounds are toxic if you give them at a high enough dose,

970
01:36:52,710 --> 01:36:55,080
and especially when you're thinking about a pharmaceutical,

971
01:36:55,080 --> 01:37:02,040
what you want to know is like, okay, if I have to give it at this level to have a necessary effect, how far is my version?

972
01:37:02,610 --> 01:37:06,180
How far have I from the level at which I'm going to see something bad?

973
01:37:06,450 --> 01:37:13,770
Right. And which system is going to be my sort of signal, my most sensitive system at which I start to see toxicity.

974
01:37:14,460 --> 01:37:22,620
Right. So for chemotherapeutic. So I talked about we know that the hematologic system and the GI system are very sensitive to the adverse effects.

975
01:37:23,040 --> 01:37:27,359
So the goal in the animal testing is to come up with a dose range at which we

976
01:37:27,360 --> 01:37:32,220
start to see intolerable adverse effects in those sort of sentinel systems.

977
01:37:32,760 --> 01:37:34,469
Or if I have an unknown compound,

978
01:37:34,470 --> 01:37:41,340
I might want to identify what are my sentinel systems so that after I do my dose extrapolation and I'm working in humans,

979
01:37:41,730 --> 01:37:45,540
I know, okay, the hematologic system is going to be the most sensitive here,

980
01:37:45,990 --> 01:37:49,800
so I'm going to want to monitor that really closely in my clinical trials for human

981
01:37:50,160 --> 01:37:53,610
because I know that at some dose level that I think I have an idea where it might be,

982
01:37:53,610 --> 01:37:57,750
but I don't know exactly. Maybe I'm gonna want to do blood counts or something on my humans.

983
01:37:58,320 --> 01:38:04,170
So the goal of the types testing is not to say I gave this to animals and nothing happened.

984
01:38:04,620 --> 01:38:12,780
It's a go. Actually, it's an unsuccessful tox test in the context of regulatory medicine if you have no effects.

985
01:38:13,580 --> 01:38:17,080
Be very nervous because you don't know where that line is. You don't.

986
01:38:17,090 --> 01:38:25,310
You also, if you're giving a cop out that's supposed to have a biologic effect, you should see at least that biologic effect in the animal.

987
01:38:25,880 --> 01:38:32,420
And if you don't, that's a huge warning sign, because that suggests that the animal is not a relevant model.

988
01:38:32,540 --> 01:38:34,850
Right, for the biologic fact that you want to see in the event.

989
01:38:35,480 --> 01:38:45,559
So a target has to be successful, does need to have some adverse finding at the higher dose levels, which obviously can be a welfare concern.

990
01:38:45,560 --> 01:38:48,650
But as we'll talk about in a minute, we have some guidelines built into that.

991
01:38:48,650 --> 01:38:55,310
We make sure those adverse signs don't go on for a long period of time and are not, you know, severe.

992
01:38:55,640 --> 01:38:59,060
But it should find some sort of limit to the dose of the goal.

993
01:39:01,370 --> 01:39:02,569
In most instances,

994
01:39:02,570 --> 01:39:08,420
it's based on the idea you're going to give an escalating dose and you expect that the higher dose is going to have a higher incidence.

995
01:39:08,840 --> 01:39:12,080
So that's why we usually have like a low, medium, high dose and talk studies.

996
01:39:12,920 --> 01:39:20,870
Not always true. Those of you interested in the endocrine system know that there are compounds like endocrine disruptors that display or misses,

997
01:39:20,990 --> 01:39:27,170
so they have like adverse effects that to lower levels and or they have no effect through lower level.

998
01:39:27,170 --> 01:39:32,960
They might have an adverse effect at a given level. And then when the receptors become saturated, there's not an increase in that response.

999
01:39:33,080 --> 01:39:43,670
So you get weird dose response curves for some companies, but for traditional talks, generally, it's dose dependent in terms of toxicity.

1000
01:39:43,670 --> 01:39:48,320
Why might you perform tough testing? Well, one reason would be to fulfill a regulatory requirement.

1001
01:39:49,280 --> 01:39:59,780
So there are agencies covering food, drugs, pesticides and chemicals in the U.S. and there's corresponding legislation for each.

1002
01:40:00,380 --> 01:40:03,380
And actually, there's a fire index below this slide.

1003
01:40:03,390 --> 01:40:08,690
I'm not going to read these books to read, and I just want to make sure we end our time here for the first day.

1004
01:40:08,690 --> 01:40:17,960
But there are agencies for each of these agents and relevant legislation upon which the tox testing is based.

1005
01:40:19,100 --> 01:40:26,510
Alternatively, you might be working on an international scale and have to fulfill international regulatory requirements.

1006
01:40:26,750 --> 01:40:30,740
One thing of note here, these ones at the bottom.

1007
01:40:31,160 --> 01:40:35,870
So I've always said, as many of you might know, is the Office of Economic Cooperation and Development.

1008
01:40:36,320 --> 01:40:43,549
And one of their roles is to set standards for chemical testing, for compounds that are going to be used in the environment.

1009
01:40:43,550 --> 01:40:49,070
So as pesticides as, I don't know, other environmental uses.

1010
01:40:49,280 --> 01:40:53,839
So the OECD actually has a number of actual testing guidelines that are as

1011
01:40:53,840 --> 01:40:58,610
specific as indicated for the type of animal species the dose you should use.

1012
01:40:59,030 --> 01:41:02,659
There's a number of very specific guidelines that the OECD develops.

1013
01:41:02,660 --> 01:41:09,230
So if you're testing chemicals, you might say that you've followed OCD test guideline for oh six.

1014
01:41:09,350 --> 01:41:12,950
So this is an agency that sets those standards for chemical testing.

1015
01:41:13,400 --> 01:41:20,360
So if I'm a global company, I don't want to have to do different testing to sell my product in the U.S. versus the EU versus Japan.

1016
01:41:20,660 --> 01:41:28,280
I want to do something that's universal and most of the major economic markets in the world except the OCD testing guidelines.

1017
01:41:28,910 --> 01:41:35,180
Similarly, there's an agent or there's an entity called the ICI, which is the International Council for Harmonization,

1018
01:41:35,630 --> 01:41:41,720
and this is the agency responsible for testing, for setting similar guidelines for the testing of pharmaceuticals.

1019
01:41:42,140 --> 01:41:47,629
Again, if I'm a pharmaceutical company, I don't want all the different countries to have different regulations.

1020
01:41:47,630 --> 01:41:54,020
So most of the major markets there are FDA follows the ICI guidelines for most pharmaceuticals.

1021
01:41:54,680 --> 01:41:57,930
So those are acronyms that you'll see when you're reading talk literature.

1022
01:41:57,930 --> 01:42:05,030
And it's important to know, you know, which ones are national and international and what they mean in terms of tox testing.

1023
01:42:05,720 --> 01:42:07,040
An important milestone.

1024
01:42:07,040 --> 01:42:15,290
And in In-Vivo, tox was a National Research Council report that came out in 2007, which related to tox testing in the 21st century.

1025
01:42:16,460 --> 01:42:20,960
And the goal of this was to increase the relevance and efficiency of toxicology testing.

1026
01:42:21,410 --> 01:42:24,770
And two of the mandates or two of the yeah,

1027
01:42:24,800 --> 01:42:32,600
two of the mandates from it were that we should move towards decreasing whole animal testing and move towards in vitro and human based testing.

1028
01:42:33,230 --> 01:42:40,670
Several reasons for that. Obviously, our end goal is to look at toxicity for humans, so it makes sense to do as much human based testing as you can.

1029
01:42:41,780 --> 01:42:47,780
There is a welfare concern, as we had said, with using whole animals for in vivo toxicology.

1030
01:42:48,770 --> 01:42:53,150
So we have an ethical responsibility to consider when and when that is not appropriate.

1031
01:42:53,660 --> 01:42:58,430
And if you want to be kind of kind of extremely crass and practical about it,

1032
01:42:58,430 --> 01:43:03,140
there is a monetary cost and in vivo animal studies are extremely expensive.

1033
01:43:03,260 --> 01:43:04,280
So I'm a company.

1034
01:43:04,280 --> 01:43:13,100
I would much prefer to have a high throughput screen where I can screen 500 compounds at once and get a decent idea of what the toxicity might be.

1035
01:43:13,450 --> 01:43:20,590
Then you have to run all those animal studies. So that's kind of the goal going along with that Research Council report,

1036
01:43:20,600 --> 01:43:26,080
there's been a reorganization of tox testing and a reconsideration of some of the traditional measures.

1037
01:43:26,650 --> 01:43:30,520
So, for example, the LD 50 must be probably have heard of the LG 50,

1038
01:43:30,940 --> 01:43:37,930
which stands for the lethal dose or indicates the lethal dose at which 50% of the animals, given a substance, will die.

1039
01:43:38,590 --> 01:43:43,690
So that used to literally be done in a very kind of crude way, where you have a number of dose groups,

1040
01:43:43,690 --> 01:43:47,200
you know, blocks animals and you pick the dose level at which 50% of them die.

1041
01:43:47,830 --> 01:43:51,310
That measure is no longer required by either the FDA or the EPA.

1042
01:43:51,730 --> 01:43:58,809
So the fifties are really not done anymore, at least that people know what they're doing in regulatory talks and has been replaced

1043
01:43:58,810 --> 01:44:04,180
by alternate methods that use fewer animals and seek to minimize pain and distress.

1044
01:44:04,960 --> 01:44:05,920
So how do they do this?

1045
01:44:05,950 --> 01:44:14,110
One method is by substituting humane endpoints rather than just let me give this to animals and let's see how many die is pretty crude.

1046
01:44:15,070 --> 01:44:18,340
So instead there's recognition that usually somewhere between us, right?

1047
01:44:18,340 --> 01:44:21,100
I'm fine, I'm fine, I'm dead. There's usually some clinical thing.

1048
01:44:22,000 --> 01:44:27,340
So one of the main one of the things you have to do when you organize a toxicity study is set.

1049
01:44:27,340 --> 01:44:33,670
What are the endpoints? So I'm going to accept that this animal is having very severe signs that eventually is going to cause it to die.

1050
01:44:34,390 --> 01:44:39,610
And the requirement now is to euthanize the animal when it reaches those humane endpoints.

1051
01:44:40,330 --> 01:44:43,480
So you're not just letting the animal die. And that has two full benefit.

1052
01:44:43,660 --> 01:44:47,920
One is that obviously it decreases animal suffering, but the other benefit is scientific.

1053
01:44:48,610 --> 01:44:50,860
So if you look at the things in this column,

1054
01:44:50,860 --> 01:44:58,269
these are the really substantial adverse effects that from the standpoint of a talk study are not desirable, is in place and what's happening here.

1055
01:44:58,270 --> 01:45:05,080
This is what the animals body's really shutting down. And you might have toxicity in one system, but as we said, everything's connected.

1056
01:45:05,530 --> 01:45:10,510
So when you get to the point where the animal is going to die, a lot of different organ systems are shutting down.

1057
01:45:10,900 --> 01:45:16,330
And the science becomes very confusing because if I look at the pathology here, a lot of things are happening.

1058
01:45:16,330 --> 01:45:19,930
They're not direct toxicities. They're just everything's shutting down.

1059
01:45:19,930 --> 01:45:26,350
So it becomes a more crude way. And I can't tell as much really what the true toxicity of the compound is.

1060
01:45:26,980 --> 01:45:31,840
So for most people, we set now humane end points, things like substantial weight loss,

1061
01:45:31,930 --> 01:45:37,120
weight loss up to 20%, a specified level of decrease in food and water intake.

1062
01:45:37,510 --> 01:45:42,490
And these other end points that are considered humane where the animals starting not to feel very well at all.

1063
01:45:42,880 --> 01:45:46,870
And those are the indicators, okay, this thing is not doing well. I'm going to euthanize the animals.

1064
01:45:46,880 --> 01:45:48,280
I'm going to minimize its suffering.

1065
01:45:48,610 --> 01:45:54,100
And then the science or the organ quality I can get from that is better than if I let the animal deteriorate more.

1066
01:45:54,600 --> 01:46:03,040
Okay, so that's what we mean by humane end points. We also have a number of different alternative testing methodologies.

1067
01:46:04,180 --> 01:46:08,950
So some of you might have heard of something called the drugs test and we know what that is.

1068
01:46:08,980 --> 01:46:11,440
Drugs test, it's not used anymore really.

1069
01:46:11,440 --> 01:46:21,670
But the drugs test is pretty horrific test where it was used often in cosmetics where if you want to test for contact irritants like for passivity,

1070
01:46:22,270 --> 01:46:26,980
they would have a rabbit and it was immobilized in like a restrainer sort of had the parent mobilized.

1071
01:46:27,010 --> 01:46:30,639
They would put the compound on its cornea. Right. So the cornea is very sensitive.

1072
01:46:30,640 --> 01:46:35,980
So you're going to get corrosion of that, but obviously that's going to cause quite a bit of distress.

1073
01:46:35,980 --> 01:46:41,170
So now an alternative method is the bovine corneal opacity and permeability test.

1074
01:46:41,920 --> 01:46:50,500
So this is a power. This is obtained from a cow and slaughter like used in the food industry, but it's actually still suitable for use of this test.

1075
01:46:51,040 --> 01:46:57,400
So yes, the animal still dies, but it's kind of reusing an animal that was used for another purpose.

1076
01:46:57,760 --> 01:47:02,400
And you don't have to subject a live animal to the stress and you can still assess the acidity.

1077
01:47:03,250 --> 01:47:06,340
So there are alternative testing methodologies that are put into place.

1078
01:47:08,560 --> 01:47:16,750
Most of these have to do with contact or like one system toxicity because one of the challenges that we still have not solved this is pretty simple.

1079
01:47:16,820 --> 01:47:22,580
You put a compound out and you see if there's epithelial corrosion, if I have a toxicity that involves multiple systems,

1080
01:47:22,580 --> 01:47:27,220
so like immune system and filtration, that is much harder to represent outside of a whole system.

1081
01:47:27,640 --> 01:47:33,880
So we're still trying to figure out how can we test toxicity that involves multiple systems or interacting systems.

1082
01:47:33,940 --> 01:47:37,000
But there are a lot of alternatives for this sort of more acute toxicity.

1083
01:47:38,800 --> 01:47:44,530
Many of these changes in toxicity testing are compatible with the animal welfare philosophy of the three RS.

1084
01:47:44,590 --> 01:47:49,330
Some of you might have heard of the three R's which stands for Reduce, Refine, Replace.

1085
01:47:49,960 --> 01:47:55,450
So it's intended that purposeful goals are to reduce the number of animals used in research and toxicology,

1086
01:47:55,990 --> 01:48:01,660
refine the way experiments are carried out. So things like humane end points rather than letting the animals die,

1087
01:48:02,410 --> 01:48:08,530
maybe anesthesia for certain procedures or painkilling medication for certain procedures,

1088
01:48:08,920 --> 01:48:13,120
and where possible, replace animal experiments with non animal techniques.

1089
01:48:13,650 --> 01:48:18,600
So that national toxicology report from 2007 utilizes these principles.

1090
01:48:19,200 --> 01:48:22,560
And those principles came from a publication back in 1959.

1091
01:48:23,040 --> 01:48:25,570
So that's that's quite a long time ago for that concept.

1092
01:48:25,590 --> 01:48:32,580
But that concept has endured and is the basis for many of our modern regulatory guidelines that pertain to animal research.

1093
01:48:33,480 --> 01:48:42,630
You talk a little bit more about that in the first, but that publication itself is actually electronically accessible along those lines.

1094
01:48:42,960 --> 01:48:46,670
I told you that the 3 hours are the basis for many of the regulatory guidelines.

1095
01:48:46,680 --> 01:48:55,260
The two major regulatory guidelines in the U.S. that govern animal use in research are the Animal Welfare Act and the Public Health Service Policy.

1096
01:48:55,920 --> 01:49:01,770
So the Animal Welfare Act is a law to federal law that actually has got very specific

1097
01:49:01,770 --> 01:49:07,500
guidelines in it that applies applies to all institutions using warm blooded vertebrates.

1098
01:49:08,250 --> 01:49:16,440
But interestingly, the somewhat controversial. It excludes specifically mice, rabbits and birds that are bred for research.

1099
01:49:17,670 --> 01:49:22,250
So originally that was done because the USDA has to enforce this law.

1100
01:49:22,260 --> 01:49:25,260
And if you included all the agencies that use mice and rats,

1101
01:49:25,260 --> 01:49:29,670
because those are by far the most common lab animals, it would become an enforcement impossibility.

1102
01:49:30,210 --> 01:49:36,210
But that is pretty controversial. And still to this day, the Animal Welfare Act does not apply to mice and rats.

1103
01:49:36,300 --> 01:49:42,600
In the law itself, those are actually excluded from the definition of animal biology.

1104
01:49:42,600 --> 01:49:46,620
That makes sense because that's how we speak. But so those are excluded.

1105
01:49:47,550 --> 01:49:52,200
As I said, it's administered by the USDA in the Animal Welfare Act itself as a guidance document.

1106
01:49:52,860 --> 01:49:57,840
But there's another piece of legislation that's called the Health Research Extension Act.

1107
01:49:58,200 --> 01:50:02,309
And that act established that all institutions that receive federal funds for

1108
01:50:02,310 --> 01:50:06,840
research have to follow something called the Public Health Service Policy.

1109
01:50:06,870 --> 01:50:12,510
So this is a policy, not a law, but this one includes all warm blooded vertebrates, including mice and rats.

1110
01:50:12,840 --> 01:50:17,340
Okay, so these are live animal welfare guidelines apply to mice and rats.

1111
01:50:17,880 --> 01:50:23,530
And individual institutions like universities can decide that even though, you know,

1112
01:50:23,610 --> 01:50:26,909
the Animal Welfare Act doesn't apply if they're receiving federal funds,

1113
01:50:26,910 --> 01:50:30,570
they have to make sure that all the research follows public health service policy.

1114
01:50:31,080 --> 01:50:37,080
And so if you hear people talk about things like the guide, this is the guidance document that stipulates that public health service policy.

1115
01:50:37,560 --> 01:50:41,160
So all research on animals on this campus has to be done in accordance.

1116
01:50:43,110 --> 01:50:46,970
There's also an agency for voluntary regulatory oversight called ELAC.

1117
01:50:47,130 --> 01:50:55,830
This is a nonprofit organization that voluntarily inspects and accredits an individual and institution's animal care and use program.

1118
01:50:56,110 --> 01:51:02,760
So it's kind of a higher standard. And many, many institutions, including ours, are elac certified.

1119
01:51:04,770 --> 01:51:08,999
And then finally, along the lines of welfare improvements and improvements in science,

1120
01:51:09,000 --> 01:51:20,260
the NIH has recently about ten years now established policy recommendations for increased rigor and reproducibility of science done using animals,

1121
01:51:20,260 --> 01:51:27,900
so particularly in preclinical research. And many of those guidelines goes along with something called the ARRIVE guidelines.

1122
01:51:28,380 --> 01:51:34,440
So these are a set of guidelines that when you write a paper that includes animal research, you have to include these pieces of information.

1123
01:51:35,310 --> 01:51:39,540
This is modeled actually after previous guidelines describing clinical trials.

1124
01:51:39,880 --> 01:51:43,650
And this was intended to sort of raise the bar for the quality of research reporting.

1125
01:51:44,640 --> 01:51:48,990
This is kind of a short summary. It is a longer article, but this is a summary of the things that,

1126
01:51:49,140 --> 01:51:54,990
according to the arrived guidelines of an animal research study must report in their publications.

1127
01:51:55,560 --> 01:51:59,690
And the ones that I have circled are the ones that are traditionally problematic.

1128
01:52:00,600 --> 01:52:07,530
So you have to have an ethical statement stating that the protocol has undergone review by your institution's Animal Care and Use Committee,

1129
01:52:08,430 --> 01:52:11,790
and you have to specify things like, okay, this was my conclusion.

1130
01:52:12,120 --> 01:52:15,840
Was my study blind it or did I know which animals were in which groups?

1131
01:52:16,110 --> 01:52:22,830
So it's trying to decrease bias and decrease lack of information in the reporting.

1132
01:52:24,120 --> 01:52:27,269
And then finally, our challenges in 21st century toxicology.

1133
01:52:27,270 --> 01:52:34,770
I think you've kind of gotten at the idea we're trying to replace whole organism animal use with in vitro methods wherever possible.

1134
01:52:35,880 --> 01:52:43,050
But some of our challenges include how do we benchmark or critical threshold doses from non whole animal systems.

1135
01:52:43,440 --> 01:52:48,810
So if you're working in a petri dish and you know, a concentration of drug that is toxic to cells,

1136
01:52:49,140 --> 01:52:53,940
how do you extrapolate that to what the dose would be when you're giving it to a whole organism?

1137
01:52:55,440 --> 01:53:00,060
Also, assessing the relevance of test systems, whether they are whole animal or in vitro.

1138
01:53:00,330 --> 01:53:06,750
So that's kind of where we're working towards. And to give you an idea of where that relevance comes in,

1139
01:53:06,900 --> 01:53:14,370
this is a really interesting series of articles from some years ago now that we're in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.

1140
01:53:14,730 --> 01:53:20,980
And I love how they published of the exact opposite title of the first article that got a lot of press.

1141
01:53:21,000 --> 01:53:30,090
The first article, which is very inflammatory, the headline, the genomic responses in mouse models poorly mimic human inflammatory diseases.

1142
01:53:30,630 --> 01:53:33,150
This was a group that applied a big data approach,

1143
01:53:33,150 --> 01:53:39,990
and they took data from a bajillion different inflammatory models in mice and tried to see if there was extrapolation

1144
01:53:39,990 --> 01:53:45,900
between the biomarkers in mice and biomarkers from similar from other from human inflammatory diseases.

1145
01:53:46,440 --> 01:53:49,890
And they came up with the conclusion that there is not good correspondence.

1146
01:53:50,760 --> 01:53:56,220
The second group, a couple years later took the same dataset, the exact same dataset,

1147
01:53:56,760 --> 01:54:01,800
but they applied a kind of science or biologically justifiable restrictions.

1148
01:54:02,280 --> 01:54:08,430
So first they said, we're going to model only conditions that have a human have a mouse equivalent.

1149
01:54:08,640 --> 01:54:13,410
So they didn't just throw all inflammatory conditions together. They're going to say, which of these are most equivalent?

1150
01:54:14,130 --> 01:54:18,340
Which ones show an inflammatory response in both mice and humans?

1151
01:54:18,360 --> 01:54:22,410
So are there molecular analogs to particular molecules?

1152
01:54:22,770 --> 01:54:26,069
And importantly, they looked at time course because as we learned,

1153
01:54:26,070 --> 01:54:30,710
the acute inflammatory response is very different from the chronic inflammatory response.

1154
01:54:30,720 --> 01:54:36,240
And if you're just going to look at cytokine expression or gene expression from acute and chronic mixed together,

1155
01:54:36,240 --> 01:54:40,470
you're going to get a lot of data, but not all of it will be interpretable.

1156
01:54:40,770 --> 01:54:44,730
So once they applied those restrictions, they actually got good correspondence.

1157
01:54:45,300 --> 01:54:48,900
So the argument rages on about who's right, which is a better approach.

1158
01:54:49,200 --> 01:54:55,050
But I think the important take home point is that when you're using animal models in toxicology and biomedical science,

1159
01:54:55,440 --> 01:54:59,670
it's important to pay attention to appropriate bottle selection and to interpret.

1160
01:54:59,730 --> 01:55:09,390
Your data in a guided way. So like you have to it has to make biologic sense and not just a numeric sense without consideration of the biology.

1161
01:55:09,600 --> 01:55:13,640
So that's kind of a struggle in modern toxicology. All right.

1162
01:55:13,650 --> 01:55:19,800
So that's our whirlwind introduction. If anybody has any questions about the support structure, you know, email them to me.

1163
01:55:19,980 --> 01:55:33,190
Those of you in the lab, part of being a little bit know I feel very much like I want to make sure that of time.

1164
01:55:36,280 --> 01:55:40,230
Now. This is the way that people feel. Yeah.

1165
01:55:40,330 --> 01:55:44,820
Yeah, I think. Another classic.

1166
01:55:49,110 --> 01:55:53,400
That over a lot more about like you said.

1167
01:55:53,430 --> 01:55:57,790
Yeah. It's like, you know, what I doing is I kind of.

1168
01:55:57,960 --> 01:56:06,660
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. That's very good.

1169
01:56:06,780 --> 01:56:40,560
Thank you. Was like, I thought you might remember that I just had Arafat a lot of your girlfriend for I mean,

1170
01:56:41,010 --> 01:56:49,250
geared towards the toxicology curriculum for people who might either be reading literature and interpreting studies or zero or something.

1171
01:56:51,670 --> 01:56:55,500
I know if you're are you you're in the class now. What are you all doing?

1172
01:56:56,280 --> 01:57:04,590
I mean, it comes off to kind of year to get a chance to go to the class, to the overview is wrestling is an open source.

1173
01:57:05,460 --> 01:57:12,780
I mean, it's not like so I don't know what I want to say to that because I know what you're saying.

1174
01:57:12,780 --> 01:57:19,320
The whole discussion assignment, I go to my lab and we thought it was like necropsy on that.

1175
01:57:20,640 --> 01:57:27,980
And then once we work through, it sounds cool that that's like, yeah, that's a bit of didactic stuff.

1176
01:57:27,990 --> 01:57:34,260
We go more in detail, people that they're going to do more detail on space, go more in detail about, like,

1177
01:57:34,260 --> 01:57:42,000
how do you interpret data for body record research with the classes where we're not running a study cause we're not really,

1178
01:57:42,180 --> 01:57:48,240
okay, like more data, but we talk about like, I'm planning a study, I want to determine the heart of what do you need to decide?

1179
01:57:48,420 --> 01:57:53,150
I look for like so experimentation that it's experimentation.

1180
01:57:53,190 --> 01:57:57,060
We're not running a study where we talk about all the different things and we're like one of them.

1181
01:57:57,960 --> 01:58:04,680
So then I have real data from a previous study, so like, like placement across your car.

1182
01:58:05,070 --> 01:58:10,469
But then we get data from mice actually from like a preview, you know, then you have to interpret it.

1183
01:58:10,470 --> 01:58:13,590
And then we write a paper, everyone's running the same paper,

1184
01:58:13,950 --> 01:58:19,440
but through the whole semester we write the time study and that and we write it in in section.

1185
01:58:19,500 --> 01:58:22,829
I like you. Give me your methods. I give you feedback. You give me your results.

1186
01:58:22,830 --> 01:58:26,390
I give you feedback. Yeah, but you're writing a scientific paper. Correct.

1187
01:58:26,400 --> 01:58:30,870
So we're going to have a really good that, that one the, the, um, you know,

1188
01:58:30,870 --> 01:58:34,290
the course competency it's supposed to fulfill one of the writing requirements.

1189
01:58:34,410 --> 01:58:39,989
So it's like a lot of writing stuff, but like all that writing and all that stuff, it's really time consuming.

1190
01:58:39,990 --> 01:58:45,959
So yeah, the room. So in a, in a semester that could be the balance.

1191
01:58:45,960 --> 01:58:51,600
Like I like having a balance of classes or your reading classes or you know, classes or you're just sitting and absorbing.

1192
01:58:51,990 --> 01:58:56,510
So I don't know if you're I don't know if your other classes are meeting today.

1193
01:58:56,510 --> 01:59:02,980
The other class though I, I've missed my day unfortunately because it's exposure assessment and really it's,

1194
01:59:03,000 --> 01:59:07,319
it's my unclarity of like when I graduate, I don't really know where I will be placed.

1195
01:59:07,320 --> 01:59:10,500
I know I'll be placed in this like toxicology world.

1196
01:59:10,530 --> 01:59:20,730
Is it like the environment? It's more environmental. So you like it's a hazardous waste site or you say that's probably I mean, yeah,

1197
01:59:20,850 --> 01:59:29,670
because like that is going to be more I don't know what to do if it's more about if they do actual or is this thing.

1198
01:59:30,150 --> 01:59:36,870
Yeah, I mean ours is very geared towards like an animal talk study and talks about like we said, I'm like I never know what people do with that data.

1199
01:59:37,530 --> 01:59:44,490
And it's not even if we're in this class, we still learn a little bit more about that and we don't really do as much of that anymore.
