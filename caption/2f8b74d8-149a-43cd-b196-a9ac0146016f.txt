2
00:00:08,214 --> 00:00:13,860
We've talked about why public health is so
important, yet there is an imbalance.

3
00:00:13,860 --> 00:00:18,660
The importance of public health,
in terms of the health of the population,

4
00:00:18,660 --> 00:00:23,400
dominates the delivery of
medical care to the population.

5
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:29,980
In contrast, we put our resources into
medical care, not into public health.

6
00:00:29,980 --> 00:00:35,130
For example, if we look at today's
expenditures, we're looking at about $3.5

7
00:00:35,130 --> 00:00:40,930
trillion a year that are devoted
to personal medical care.

8
00:00:40,930 --> 00:00:47,958
In contrast, the entire field of public
health receives only about $50 billion.

9
00:00:47,958 --> 00:00:49,890
So why do we have this imbalance?

10
00:00:49,890 --> 00:00:52,770
Why is public health so important, but

11
00:00:52,770 --> 00:00:58,240
medical care where we put our resources,
where we spend money?

12
00:00:58,240 --> 00:01:01,010
There are about 5 good reasons for this.

13
00:01:01,010 --> 00:01:03,446
1 is, there are market systems or

14
00:01:03,446 --> 00:01:08,600
economic interests that are catering
to services for individuals.

15
00:01:08,600 --> 00:01:11,200
Public health is often a public good,

16
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:14,950
it's something that the market
itself doesn't handle well.

17
00:01:14,950 --> 00:01:20,850
Because individual people aren't going
out to try to buy public health.

18
00:01:20,850 --> 00:01:24,285
A second concern lies in
interest group politics.

19
00:01:24,285 --> 00:01:28,640
There are often very contentious
issues related to public health.

20
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:32,420
And we'll talk about this
more later on in the course.

21
00:01:32,420 --> 00:01:37,010
Importantly, there's a question
of what people want.

22
00:01:37,010 --> 00:01:39,870
We refer to this as the Rule of Rescue.

23
00:01:39,870 --> 00:01:44,820
People want to be taken care of when
there's something seriously wrong with

24
00:01:44,820 --> 00:01:49,280
them, an illness or a serious injury.

25
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:53,070
They're much less interested
in doing something,

26
00:01:53,070 --> 00:01:57,510
which we'll come to later that's going
to help their health in the future,

27
00:01:57,510 --> 00:02:02,310
by avoiding these injuries and
these illnesses.

28
00:02:02,310 --> 00:02:07,210
Fourth, people don't appreciate
relative risks, a notable example,

29
00:02:07,210 --> 00:02:11,810
a very common one is that people
worry about flying in airplanes,

30
00:02:11,810 --> 00:02:15,440
which is an incredibly safe
way of getting around.

31
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:19,520
But they don't think much about
the dangers of driving in their cars,

32
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:23,430
which is a much more
risky form of conveyance.

33
00:02:23,430 --> 00:02:27,020
And finally,
we have the invisibility of public health.

34
00:02:27,020 --> 00:02:30,373
And this is a really important
feature of our field.

35
00:02:30,373 --> 00:02:34,078
In a sense, it's a very desirable one,
in another sense,

36
00:02:34,078 --> 00:02:39,400
It makes it difficult to sell public
health to legislators and the public.

37
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:44,120
Because people don't see
public health when it works.

38
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:48,510
If you ask a class of undergraduates
today how many of them

39
00:02:48,510 --> 00:02:52,750
have ever had measles,
almost no hands will go up.

40
00:02:52,750 --> 00:02:57,180
If you ask how many have had mumps,
again, you'll see very few hands.

41
00:02:57,180 --> 00:03:00,260
If you ask about chicken pox,
you might see quite a few hands.

42
00:03:00,260 --> 00:03:05,310
Although, interestingly, because of
new vaccinations, the next generation,

43
00:03:05,310 --> 00:03:09,720
their children won't raise their
hands when that question is asked.

44
00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:16,090
If you ask about polio, in the case of
polio, you'll see no hands whatsoever.

45
00:03:16,090 --> 00:03:18,260
But if you were talking
about my generation,

46
00:03:18,260 --> 00:03:23,590
you would have seen hands up for
all of those diseases.

47
00:03:23,590 --> 00:03:25,190
Polio less than some others,

48
00:03:25,190 --> 00:03:31,690
because my generation was at the very
beginning of polio immunization.

49
00:03:31,690 --> 00:03:34,730
But I do know people who
suffered from that disease.

50
00:03:34,730 --> 00:03:36,050
So, what does this mean?

51
00:03:36,050 --> 00:03:40,720
This means that public health
through vaccination has

52
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:47,090
eliminated a broad range of very
debilitating and costly diseases.

53
00:03:47,090 --> 00:03:51,010
And your generation has no concept

54
00:03:51,010 --> 00:03:54,440
of these diseases playing
any role in their lives.

55
00:03:54,440 --> 00:03:59,237
So public health's success translates
into public health invisibility.

56
00:03:59,237 --> 00:04:03,012
And, again, it makes it a hard sell.

57
00:04:03,012 --> 00:04:07,582
I want you to think for a moment about
your own activities in terms of what we

58
00:04:07,582 --> 00:04:10,250
would call health promotion.

59
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:13,380
Let's think about an exercise program.

60
00:04:13,380 --> 00:04:17,900
The benefits of an exercise program
are really pretty abstract and deferred,

61
00:04:17,900 --> 00:04:21,990
in the sense that,
if you're a good conscientious exerciser,

62
00:04:21,990 --> 00:04:23,210
you do it for years.

63
00:04:23,210 --> 00:04:27,330
You make it a part of your regular
lifestyle, you have a far better chance

64
00:04:27,330 --> 00:04:33,990
than others of avoiding an early
heart attack, stroke and so on.

65
00:04:33,990 --> 00:04:37,570
You're much more likely to
enjoy a long and healthy life.

66
00:04:37,570 --> 00:04:44,420
But the idea that the exercise has to
be done today, that it's tangible,

67
00:04:44,420 --> 00:04:50,320
it's taking time out of your day, it's
work, that's an immediate cost to you.

68
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:57,300
Those benefits of improved health 10,
20 years down the line are an abstraction.

69
00:04:57,300 --> 00:05:00,670
Think in contrast of what we
might call the benefits and

70
00:05:00,670 --> 00:05:03,360
costs of disease promotion.

71
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:06,170
Think about that beautiful
slice of chocolate cake,

72
00:05:06,170 --> 00:05:09,090
that irresistible piece of chocolate cake.

73
00:05:09,090 --> 00:05:13,097
I mean, I am a chocoholic, I see that,
I just gotta put it in my mouth.

74
00:05:13,097 --> 00:05:15,420
There's nothing I can
do to control myself.

75
00:05:15,420 --> 00:05:20,990
Those benefits are really tangible, this
is delicious stuff, and they're immediate.

76
00:05:20,990 --> 00:05:26,900
The costs, in contrast,
are really kind of abstract and deferred.

77
00:05:26,900 --> 00:05:31,105
Am l clogging my arteries by this one
little piece of chocolate cake that l am

78
00:05:31,105 --> 00:05:32,230
eating.

79
00:05:32,230 --> 00:05:37,140
Is that going to influence my health 10,
20 years from now?

80
00:05:37,140 --> 00:05:39,680
That's not something l
tend to think of when l'm

81
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:42,630
eyeing that piece of chocolate cake.

82
00:05:42,630 --> 00:05:45,849
So public health is a bit of a tough sell,

83
00:05:45,849 --> 00:05:53,186
because it does involve thinking about
abstract benefits in the future.
