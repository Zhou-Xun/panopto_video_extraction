1
00:00:10,770 --> 00:00:32,239
Okay. Let's get started. So in that last lecture we learn the piecewise linear interpolation and also higher pulling.

2
00:00:32,240 --> 00:00:34,310
How are you putting them into interpolation?

3
00:00:34,790 --> 00:00:50,930
Well, so this is an example of a logic phenomenon where a hybrid of polynomial gives you unexpected fluctuations in the theory value.

4
00:00:51,980 --> 00:01:02,000
But the piecewise linear interpolation does perform some of the feeding of this curve.

5
00:01:04,270 --> 00:01:13,979
So. But piecewise piecewise linear functions doesn't look like visually,

6
00:01:13,980 --> 00:01:21,340
it doesn't look like a typical function and they have some undesirable properties, right?

7
00:01:21,420 --> 00:01:32,700
So for example, if you wanted to take the derivative, the, you know, the derivative function is not going to be continuous for.

8
00:01:39,160 --> 00:01:44,560
There is not going to be continuous for the coalition so that there'll be a problem.

9
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:52,300
So alternative way to do it is that if we use a first degree polynomial,

10
00:01:52,570 --> 00:01:57,970
that would be, you know, it would look nice because but there are a lot of problems.

11
00:01:58,450 --> 00:02:01,840
So what, what if we we use a higher order polynomial?

12
00:02:02,330 --> 00:02:14,800
So that's the idea. So a potentially practical solution is using cubic plane because it's very well established,

13
00:02:15,490 --> 00:02:24,460
it's a reasonable request and it does give a very nice property in terms of differential ability and a continuity of the curve.

14
00:02:25,990 --> 00:02:30,610
So cubic supply is basically using cubic functions to.

15
00:02:32,020 --> 00:02:40,600
So you're doing the interpolation like piecewise interpolation, but instead of using linear function, you're using cubic function.

16
00:02:41,140 --> 00:02:50,500
Okay. So then it construct a differentiable integrate into integral and smooth curve.

17
00:02:51,940 --> 00:02:55,060
Even if you join multiple functions together. Right.

18
00:02:55,630 --> 00:03:08,860
So you have so in the piecewise linear interpolation, there's a guarantee that the y value in those in the intersection will be the same.

19
00:03:09,700 --> 00:03:17,680
But the. The derivative will not be continuous anymore.

20
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:23,950
If you use a quadratic function, derivative will be continuous of a second derivative will not be continuous.

21
00:03:23,950 --> 00:03:30,250
So in this case you guarantee that derivative and second derivative where we continuous across the joint.

22
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:36,290
So and if you use a pulling them out degree of free three.

23
00:03:36,770 --> 00:03:48,410
But there are a lot of analytic algorithms. You just delay in the first and second order, second of their functions.

24
00:03:48,530 --> 00:03:56,120
So the different derivatives, so those are those are usually good enough and those will be sufficient for running

25
00:03:56,120 --> 00:04:02,990
most of the the algorithm that assumes the field of function is fully differentiable.

26
00:04:04,100 --> 00:04:10,580
Then you can, you can plug them in and you can still calculate the gradient in hessian and so on.

27
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:15,680
Okay. So that's that's the you've explained.

28
00:04:15,980 --> 00:04:23,990
Okay. So in a how do we make cubic splay so that that is not your problem?

29
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:34,010
Okay. So, I mean, some people may think this is a tedious because it's a lot of algebra and figuring out,

30
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:44,030
you know, how to, you know how to find out these coefficient B equally to, to fit into the supplies.

31
00:04:44,270 --> 00:04:55,600
Right. So but there are some, I mean this that we can have some nice tricks and good algebraic knowledge required.

32
00:04:55,670 --> 00:04:58,100
So I think these are these are good practice.

33
00:04:58,100 --> 00:05:09,470
You can try to prove yourself and see where how close your solution is compared to the well known attributes that everything.

34
00:05:11,480 --> 00:05:21,010
So, uh, so let's say we have a quick explain function representing, uh, so I,

35
00:05:21,430 --> 00:05:33,470
I think you mean in music and I thought they had, uh, we compiled the slide, but probably was not.

36
00:05:35,190 --> 00:05:39,330
Okay. It was not fixed.

37
00:05:39,390 --> 00:05:43,140
So it is fixed now. So all of that, a load of data slides.

38
00:05:43,710 --> 00:05:50,370
Okay. So you have a data points, right?

39
00:05:50,670 --> 00:05:54,060
And we assume that the all the data points are sorted.

40
00:05:54,330 --> 00:05:59,340
Okay. Right. Excite X is equal to the X side plus one.

41
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:10,740
And for any data point to be constructed in minus one interpolating cubic polynomial for each of these and minus two intervals.

42
00:06:11,250 --> 00:06:14,500
Okay. So how do we construct that?

43
00:06:14,520 --> 00:06:23,730
Right. So. So let's say s of I of x is a supply and we want it to fit for each of the interval.

44
00:06:23,750 --> 00:06:27,870
So we have and minus one different lines. We need to figure it out.

45
00:06:28,950 --> 00:06:35,880
So the supplying function is a cubic function so you can represent this way or this way.

46
00:06:35,940 --> 00:06:45,240
Both of them are fine, but it's only valid to have a valid value between the x when x is between x x i to x a plus one.

47
00:06:45,690 --> 00:06:53,940
Okay. Then if you take the derivative of this spline function, this is the derivative.

48
00:06:54,420 --> 00:06:57,760
If you take the second derivative, this is a secondary.

49
00:06:58,140 --> 00:07:07,770
So. So far, so good. So then how many coefficient do you need to figure out if you if you do this.

50
00:07:10,110 --> 00:07:18,419
For each of the supply and therefore coefficient you need to figure out there's a minus at minus one coefficient you need to figure out.

51
00:07:18,420 --> 00:07:29,640
So this is a quite a large solution to solve and it is not straightforward because you need to guarantee that both so.

52
00:07:31,480 --> 00:07:40,280
So Vex. So it is actually a function. And first, so the derivative and secondly, the derivative, they should be all continuous, right?

53
00:07:40,310 --> 00:07:43,570
So those are the creator you're going to use.

54
00:07:43,960 --> 00:07:47,710
We have a lot of equations to solve. So. So.

55
00:07:49,460 --> 00:07:52,460
So maybe things you wanted to check is that.

56
00:07:52,460 --> 00:07:59,690
Do I have the right number of patients? Right. Because you need to so four times and minus one coefficient.

57
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:10,460
So you want to make sure that you have all these the independent equations you can use so that that's one thing you may want to check.

58
00:08:11,150 --> 00:08:15,260
And second thing is that, you know, how do I solve this, right?

59
00:08:17,210 --> 00:08:21,620
So, so these are the conditions you can you can use.

60
00:08:21,620 --> 00:08:28,699
So basically you want to use the fact that these are continuous.

61
00:08:28,700 --> 00:08:31,070
So that means that because a,

62
00:08:31,080 --> 00:08:39,890
your given the way value usually when you you can easily evaluate the way you value in a way value is actually sorry but why value is a given.

63
00:08:40,310 --> 00:08:46,730
So you want to use the way value. So the fact that these are continuous so you can represent this way.

64
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:56,150
So as of x over so as the idea of x i is y of I, right?

65
00:08:57,110 --> 00:09:08,230
So, so this is a this is one one equation and another equation is that this function display function is defined from the interval X,

66
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:16,879
it s eight plus one. So the equation also holds.

67
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:26,810
So these are, these are it looks it looks like it's the same inductive formula, but it's not because the indexes are doing the same same client.

68
00:09:27,350 --> 00:09:31,610
This is a left leftmost value and there should be equivalent of y,

69
00:09:31,610 --> 00:09:42,290
but that's plain also should also cross x eight plus when x is x plus one then that value should be yy8 plus one.

70
00:09:42,980 --> 00:09:52,400
So then in the next play in particular as of I plus one x of eight plus one should be y y y y plus one.

71
00:09:52,400 --> 00:10:01,370
Then that then means that they are continuous, right? So you basically have to if you have only these two equations,

72
00:10:01,370 --> 00:10:10,970
you can only fit into two and two times a minus one coefficient because those are, those are number of solutions you have.

73
00:10:11,720 --> 00:10:22,750
So that'll, that'll make you be able to solve linear population problem but not cubic explain problem because you need twice

74
00:10:22,790 --> 00:10:36,440
many parameters we need to of fit so the other so this is the other parameters you want to use okay is that.

75
00:10:40,530 --> 00:10:44,820
So this one. So you want to you.

76
00:10:45,420 --> 00:10:49,650
So we were assuming that, first of all, the derivative is continuous.

77
00:10:50,070 --> 00:10:52,620
He also issuing the second of the derivative is continuous.

78
00:10:52,620 --> 00:11:01,439
But these can be true only between the so between the supplies and their end minus one supply.

79
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:04,530
So that means that there must and minus two competitions you can make.

80
00:11:05,070 --> 00:11:08,820
So this is at minus two. This is my suit is a minus one, the most source.

81
00:11:08,840 --> 00:11:18,340
So these are four and minus six equations you have and you need two more equations to solve these parameters.

82
00:11:18,660 --> 00:11:28,590
Okay, so all the parameters. So we're putting extra boundary conditions, which is not obvious, but this is a sort of natural choice,

83
00:11:29,550 --> 00:11:35,700
which is I'm going to assume that the second derivative of X of one and x0 away.

84
00:11:35,710 --> 00:11:41,040
So when you, when you have an X with when you extrapolate at the end,

85
00:11:41,340 --> 00:11:51,230
you need to decide what the value of the second derivative will be and that you can just fix, then fix the second derivative a certain value.

86
00:11:51,240 --> 00:11:58,440
So that's a reasonable choice because you don't want to really like restrict the first derivative, because the first derivative,

87
00:11:58,440 --> 00:12:04,919
if you restrict it, you're just steering too much on the hard part, what the extrapolation should be.

88
00:12:04,920 --> 00:12:12,840
But if you assume that the second derivatives and you know, then that that or that works out sort of naturally like that.

89
00:12:12,990 --> 00:12:21,240
So looks like a natural extension of the curve the last supply that that was used for interpolation.

90
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:24,810
So that's why it's called a natural cubic supply.

91
00:12:25,350 --> 00:12:29,669
And because it's so many people agree that this is a natural choice,

92
00:12:29,670 --> 00:12:34,470
although there is no mathematical justification that this is the right thing to do.

93
00:12:35,580 --> 00:12:38,650
Okay. So.

94
00:12:39,130 --> 00:12:42,400
So that's what we're going to solve. So how do we solve that?

95
00:12:42,530 --> 00:12:51,690
Okay, so this is a lot of equations and I, I, if I can, I can go all these individual creations, but it's very easy to get lost.

96
00:12:51,700 --> 00:12:55,319
I often get lost, like when I follow this.

97
00:12:55,320 --> 00:13:00,920
This slide we have. You know, we have several slides to go on.

98
00:13:01,370 --> 00:13:07,370
So my strategy to go back and forth multiple times and try to figure out where we're going.

99
00:13:07,820 --> 00:13:18,980
This is almost like a maze. So I'm going to go back and forth in multiple slide and try to show where we want to get to.

100
00:13:19,580 --> 00:13:24,410
And I'm going to explain briefly like how you can get there.

101
00:13:24,420 --> 00:13:29,659
But if you. So it's a it's a matter of plugging one equation to the other.

102
00:13:29,660 --> 00:13:33,680
And it's a it's a lot of a lot of complication happening.

103
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:44,930
So I'll just to give you a big picture and you can try to follow the actual, you know, details later if you get confused with the details.

104
00:13:45,080 --> 00:13:48,560
Okay. So here here is what?

105
00:13:50,160 --> 00:14:00,220
Here's a some convenience values that that that actually are useful to keep track of the values of X and Y.

106
00:14:00,340 --> 00:14:07,070
So instead of using an X and Y directly, if you use this value H of AI,

107
00:14:07,370 --> 00:14:17,090
so h of AI is basically the difference between so each of the interval sides of each interval basically.

108
00:14:17,930 --> 00:14:28,220
So that's h of I that of I is that, you know, the, there's the delta delta Y over Delta X.

109
00:14:28,430 --> 00:14:32,490
So this is the slope. Okay. So average slope.

110
00:14:32,540 --> 00:14:39,080
So Delta is the it's not really linear function, but let's say I use a little data place n but this would be,

111
00:14:39,290 --> 00:14:43,160
would have been a slope for this particular interval.

112
00:14:43,220 --> 00:14:56,530
Right. So and a g of I feel I can be defined as just the summation of two two interval.

113
00:14:56,530 --> 00:15:02,109
So g of I can be defined as a side of the two intervals, not just the only interval.

114
00:15:02,110 --> 00:15:09,099
Tweetable. Okay. In a V of i is there is a delta.

115
00:15:09,100 --> 00:15:12,810
Y is a slope, right? So you change it. Change the slope.

116
00:15:12,820 --> 00:15:21,460
So a difference of the slope. How slope change it between the interval so that that that is the interpretation of V of I.

117
00:15:21,910 --> 00:15:28,350
So these values are chosen just because it makes the calculation easier.

118
00:15:28,360 --> 00:15:40,030
There is no real there is no necessarily a connection with this sort of a concept to be actually used for deriving the equation.

119
00:15:40,180 --> 00:15:44,469
Okay. So let me let me jump through this slide.

120
00:15:44,470 --> 00:15:48,460
And I'm I'm I promise that I'm I'm going to come back.

121
00:15:49,210 --> 00:15:54,630
So eventually what we are going to do is we're going to show this creation is true.

122
00:15:55,250 --> 00:16:00,510
Okay. So and this involves so, so limited.

123
00:16:00,700 --> 00:16:05,499
So when you do this complicated algebra, always remember what you want to do.

124
00:16:05,500 --> 00:16:10,690
And what you want to do is try to figure out a coefficient of a.

125
00:16:11,110 --> 00:16:16,149
So this equation is interesting because it only involves a a of two.

126
00:16:16,150 --> 00:16:26,170
So there are three coefficient a0818283282 is basically a quadratic term, so this is a quadratic term coefficient.

127
00:16:26,170 --> 00:16:30,490
We're going to solve it first and there is a three parts.

128
00:16:30,850 --> 00:16:34,320
Okay, but so these three are unknowns.

129
00:16:34,330 --> 00:16:39,159
We don't know. We want to solve that, but this H and G and V,

130
00:16:39,160 --> 00:16:47,350
which which was defined previously are all can be calculated because of x of I and y of I is already given, right?

131
00:16:47,560 --> 00:16:53,140
So those observe values. So you basically have a equation with three.

132
00:16:53,470 --> 00:17:00,130
So three unknown values and all coefficients are known if the data is given.

133
00:17:00,370 --> 00:17:11,079
Okay. So this is the equation we are going to solve. And let me because this part is a is all very complicated, but this is not the poor part.

134
00:17:11,080 --> 00:17:19,390
This is just a the this is this is the required for for all the details that the figuring out all the details.

135
00:17:19,810 --> 00:17:23,290
I'm going to skip the rules. There is some boundary condition you need to make.

136
00:17:23,530 --> 00:17:33,460
I'm going to skip this now. And this is a matrix representation you are going to get if you believe that this equation is correct.

137
00:17:33,910 --> 00:17:45,550
So basically you have a three, three consecutive of values and three consecutive values you can multiply multiplied to to to match for your VI.

138
00:17:45,580 --> 00:17:50,950
So this is exactly the same equation. So the same equation like this.

139
00:17:51,490 --> 00:17:59,530
But instead of using this way, you can represent with the matrix operation by feeling the all value to be zero.

140
00:17:59,920 --> 00:18:04,450
Okay. So I'm going to explain this part first.

141
00:18:04,600 --> 00:18:20,470
How do you solve this? Because all these are all these derivation of the details eventually get into this equation and you need to solve these a 2/1.

142
00:18:20,770 --> 00:18:25,239
And after that you're going to solve other coefficients.

143
00:18:25,240 --> 00:18:27,520
So I'm going to do backward way.

144
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:33,940
So I'm going to show this part because of this part is more important and then this is a poor part of the cube explained.

145
00:18:34,510 --> 00:18:38,169
So I'm going to explain this part first and we're going to get back to the details

146
00:18:38,170 --> 00:18:44,470
later so that I think that's a lot easier to understand without getting copied.

147
00:18:44,740 --> 00:18:50,880
I didn't quite get this part because pieces are like ten equations, you know,

148
00:18:51,430 --> 00:18:54,579
putting, putting back together so that that part is a little complicated.

149
00:18:54,580 --> 00:19:04,120
So let's, let's do it later. Okay. But if you believe me that this is the this is the eventually the equation you're going to have, okay?

150
00:19:04,570 --> 00:19:12,100
But this is not done yet. Okay. So let's say you have magically have this equation came out, then what what would you do?

151
00:19:12,100 --> 00:19:18,489
So you have basically this doesn't have the boundary values.

152
00:19:18,490 --> 00:19:21,880
These only have a nice two values of a two.

153
00:19:22,630 --> 00:19:31,990
So but this is a matrix operations, right? So presumably you can use the matrix operation to do this is a right.

154
00:19:32,290 --> 00:19:41,890
Can you can you so these values known value, this is the value you want to estimate and these values also known value.

155
00:19:41,900 --> 00:19:52,610
So you can just use a linear. Old media system too is just a useful function in trying to get the value of of a is a fair.

156
00:19:54,250 --> 00:19:57,670
Okay. What's the what do you think is the problem?

157
00:19:58,420 --> 00:20:03,370
What what what kind of problem do you think we will have if we use a matrix operation to do this?

158
00:20:06,100 --> 00:20:11,380
Have anyone used the lead to explain for your research?

159
00:20:13,830 --> 00:20:16,740
How many points have have you used for cubic supply?

160
00:20:19,660 --> 00:20:26,140
Looks like you haven't you haven't used this point a lot, but if you use a thousand points, maybe, okay.

161
00:20:26,620 --> 00:20:33,280
But if you do 10,000 points, this involves the inverting 10,000 by 10,000 matrix.

162
00:20:34,350 --> 00:20:37,440
How much do it take? How long does it take? That takes a lot of time.

163
00:20:37,470 --> 00:20:47,400
But if you have a million points, so this is not going to be scalable if you use a matrix operation because it involves a lot of values.

164
00:20:47,640 --> 00:20:57,680
Okay. So. So even if you have these matrix representation you are not in,

165
00:20:58,140 --> 00:21:03,770
you are strongly not encouraged to use the matrix operation to solve this because this has

166
00:21:03,770 --> 00:21:09,530
a lot of zeros and really linear system doesn't know how to solve this linear system.

167
00:21:09,540 --> 00:21:13,310
One, you could try to use a sparse matrix. I haven't done it.

168
00:21:13,940 --> 00:21:19,040
I suspect they can be faster. But you still don't know this banded structure exactly.

169
00:21:19,040 --> 00:21:23,780
So it doesn't leverage those this specific tribunal structure.

170
00:21:23,790 --> 00:21:36,290
So it's not going to be you know, it's not going to be like super fast compared to this particular algorithm that that that is feature this year.

171
00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:44,960
So so that so but before before getting to that how how you solve this,

172
00:21:45,350 --> 00:21:51,350
let's say you are able to solve this y you know, it doesn't matter whether you use a matrix operation or not.

173
00:21:51,470 --> 00:21:58,250
So it's a now doing whatever the computation efficiency you just need are talking about the correctness.

174
00:21:58,250 --> 00:22:07,100
Then we, we, so we all agree that we can get a two values except for the very, very, the end of the values.

175
00:22:07,130 --> 00:22:11,540
Okay, so these so we all get we cannot get this value,

176
00:22:11,840 --> 00:22:21,680
but this is only we need the four end times four for n minus four parameters and we need oh, sorry.

177
00:22:21,680 --> 00:22:24,830
We need to for NPR News, as I said, for four and minus.

178
00:22:24,920 --> 00:22:31,580
So four in my four parameters, because there's N minus one efficiency supply the supplies to fit.

179
00:22:31,970 --> 00:22:36,440
And among them, this is less than one one quarter.

180
00:22:36,440 --> 00:22:40,700
So what how well, how can we get the other parts?

181
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:51,350
Okay. So because we're using the natural cubic plane, assuming that the second derivative is zero, that means that that we have all values a of two.

182
00:22:52,040 --> 00:22:58,670
So then in the equation we had, we just skipped over there is this equation.

183
00:22:58,940 --> 00:23:06,440
Okay, so we'll get back to that so you can using the situation you can you can get the A of three, okay.

184
00:23:06,620 --> 00:23:13,580
So the Q cubic cubic coefficient and you can also use that if you have a.

185
00:23:16,490 --> 00:23:22,130
If you have a quadratic term coefficient, you can also use this equation to get the linear.

186
00:23:22,370 --> 00:23:37,009
So the first order coefficient and the y value y of ise, just each of the constant cluster and time itself is the way of ise.

187
00:23:37,010 --> 00:23:43,219
So we, we can solve everything because these are these are relatively easy to figure out.

188
00:23:43,220 --> 00:23:46,910
So really the core part is now getting a of two.

189
00:23:46,940 --> 00:23:51,679
How do we get these two? Okay, so and how so?

190
00:23:51,680 --> 00:24:03,889
Basically this slide is core slide because before this slide, it's all explaining about how you can represent all these question with eliminating A0,

191
00:24:03,890 --> 00:24:11,900
A1 and A3 only using the A2 and using the all the combination of known values of X and Y.

192
00:24:11,900 --> 00:24:15,350
That's that's the core equation you're going to get here.

193
00:24:15,620 --> 00:24:26,570
Okay. So and after that, after this slide, what we are going to do is that how do we do the computation more efficiently?

194
00:24:26,750 --> 00:24:35,780
Okay. So that part, because you are doing the steps to computing that the linear algebra class or just so the doing this proof,

195
00:24:36,360 --> 00:24:39,469
I would I would think that that part is more important.

196
00:24:39,470 --> 00:24:42,500
So I'm going to go that part first and come back to this part.

197
00:24:42,650 --> 00:24:51,350
Okay. So these slides are quite, quite tricky to adjust, but I'm trying to give sort of roadmap to how to digest these slides.

198
00:24:51,440 --> 00:25:00,650
This slide contains all the all the details I believe in. If you have any difficulty in following something, I'm happy to provide more information.

199
00:25:01,940 --> 00:25:05,420
But yeah, that's what I'm trying to get it.

200
00:25:05,570 --> 00:25:14,059
Okay. So basically so you have a complete values, but then now it doesn't matter what exact values are.

201
00:25:14,060 --> 00:25:24,140
Just let's say I'm going to say this is a tri diagonal, which means that there there is a diagonal element here and one up.

202
00:25:24,560 --> 00:25:28,190
So just that there's a there's a upper triangular.

203
00:25:28,190 --> 00:25:32,210
There is a one on a extra bend and there's a row triangle, the extra bend.

204
00:25:32,870 --> 00:25:36,320
And these are but these are symmetry.

205
00:25:36,620 --> 00:25:43,729
So but those are those are the structure of this equation.

206
00:25:43,730 --> 00:25:49,340
But it doesn't have to be symmetric. So let's try to figure out the algorithm to solve this of CRI.

207
00:25:49,340 --> 00:25:54,590
They are going to they're going to matrix over in in general.

208
00:25:54,590 --> 00:25:58,730
So let's say you have a diagonal one and upward triangular bend and road ring event.

209
00:25:59,390 --> 00:26:07,100
So in the everything else is know in this case how they solve this linear system without paying for the cubic time complexity.

210
00:26:07,340 --> 00:26:10,490
So that's the question. Okay. So,

211
00:26:12,140 --> 00:26:19,750
so now you can you can forget about this because if you we get these are these are

212
00:26:19,760 --> 00:26:23,030
which you can just plug in this are good because this is more general problem.

213
00:26:23,780 --> 00:26:32,470
Okay so so if you solve this with linear system, with typical linear algebra solution, it's going to be slow, right?

214
00:26:32,480 --> 00:26:37,610
So it's going to work, but it's going to be slow. So how do we solve this?

215
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:47,180
Okay, so so we are going to go so we are going to solve this in the two step.

216
00:26:47,450 --> 00:26:54,860
Okay. One is of what is called a force sweep and a second is a backwards sweep.

217
00:26:55,520 --> 00:27:06,140
Okay. So force sweep is that we are transforming these matrix each rows and columns into different way.

218
00:27:06,530 --> 00:27:15,499
So by simple linear operation, addition or or multiplication and those simple operations,

219
00:27:15,500 --> 00:27:24,470
we're going to simplify this form into so simplify this matrix form into simpler format that is more straightforward to solve.

220
00:27:25,010 --> 00:27:29,780
And after that, we're going to do the backward sweep where we solve the equation from the backward.

221
00:27:29,930 --> 00:27:34,520
Okay. So for sweep, okay, how do we do it?

222
00:27:34,550 --> 00:27:45,170
Okay. So, so when you have this equation, okay, so my objective here is that first objective is that I'm going to make all the diagonal to one.

223
00:27:45,560 --> 00:27:49,400
Okay. So y because that's easy to understand.

224
00:27:50,120 --> 00:27:53,150
So how do we do it? You just you can divide.

225
00:27:53,660 --> 00:27:59,299
So as long as you can scale the, the row in the same way that nothing is changing.

226
00:27:59,300 --> 00:28:03,260
Right. So you just divide everything by one here, okay?

227
00:28:03,950 --> 00:28:07,220
And because of that equation will get messy.

228
00:28:07,640 --> 00:28:12,350
I'm going to define this as you want, Star.

229
00:28:13,070 --> 00:28:16,470
I'm going to define this as a. One star is a new value.

230
00:28:16,790 --> 00:28:21,750
Okay, so. So far, so good. And after that.

231
00:28:21,810 --> 00:28:26,250
So now I have a diagonal effect, size one, and I have a new you one value.

232
00:28:26,940 --> 00:28:33,630
And, and then so here ticket part is I want to get rid of this lower triangle triangular part.

233
00:28:33,960 --> 00:28:44,910
Okay, so how do we do it? You just subtract some some some multiplication over your first row, subtract that to make it.

234
00:28:44,920 --> 00:28:49,140
You can you can find the right subtraction factor, which is our one here.

235
00:28:49,330 --> 00:28:55,709
Okay, so just multiply multiply l one with with this because this is would be one star

236
00:28:55,710 --> 00:29:02,940
just multiply by l one is subtracted and the rewrite the the second row this way.

237
00:29:03,370 --> 00:29:08,759
Okay. So there's nothing wrong with that. And you can you can prove that that's all mathematically correct.

238
00:29:08,760 --> 00:29:12,270
The equivalent interpreting the interval but sorry,

239
00:29:12,300 --> 00:29:23,440
mathematically equivalent way to write the same equation as long as it doesn't doesn't make the equation, it doesn't reduce the rank of the matrix.

240
00:29:23,440 --> 00:29:25,110
So. So then.

241
00:29:25,140 --> 00:29:35,520
Then you have this part where basically you don't have any lower triangular part anymore and you have these two values and you can do the same thing.

242
00:29:35,550 --> 00:29:39,120
Okay. In the in the second round, I'm going to do the same thing again.

243
00:29:39,390 --> 00:29:45,660
Okay? So make the diagonal is one and divide this value with this diagonal vector.

244
00:29:46,020 --> 00:29:51,420
So these values becomes a little more trickier to calculate, but you can still represent these.

245
00:29:51,490 --> 00:29:56,700
So I'm going to say this is a U2 star. I'm going to say that this is ab2 star.

246
00:29:57,000 --> 00:30:05,670
Okay. So now I made until the second row, I made a diagonal to one and make up the name of the lower down.

247
00:30:05,970 --> 00:30:11,490
Right. So that's what I what I did. Okay. So now I think you get.

248
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:16,260
So this is a now repeatable because I want to get rid of al2,

249
00:30:16,740 --> 00:30:23,180
I want to make the diagonal to one so you can keep doing this by me, by repeated read later.

250
00:30:23,200 --> 00:30:32,579
It's going through the loop. So if equal to two and minus one, you define U of I this way you have a star.

251
00:30:32,580 --> 00:30:39,570
This way you define B of a star this way. And at the end you just defined at the end there.

252
00:30:39,930 --> 00:30:43,290
So at the end there is no u of gn.

253
00:30:43,320 --> 00:30:46,520
So U of because because at the end.

254
00:30:47,340 --> 00:30:51,060
So you you don't have the this part is basically zero.

255
00:30:51,300 --> 00:30:58,920
There's nothing. So once you get rid of everything at the end, you only have the n like this, right?

256
00:30:58,920 --> 00:31:02,280
So and then you hope you won't have a beep of RN as well.

257
00:31:03,270 --> 00:31:08,310
So then the if you simply because a u u of.

258
00:31:09,150 --> 00:31:14,760
So all this value because you are trying to find the X here which is a actually by the way,

259
00:31:14,760 --> 00:31:19,100
this is a to your actually calculate trying to calculate in the previous equation.

260
00:31:19,110 --> 00:31:28,049
I just because this is a general general representation, I change it to X so and then all the other values are just the constant.

261
00:31:28,050 --> 00:31:33,990
So it looks complicated, but you're just calculating this, rescaling those constants in different way.

262
00:31:33,990 --> 00:31:36,860
Then you basically have this equation, okay,

263
00:31:37,380 --> 00:31:49,140
you have now I have a triangular matrix that has only one of a triangular band and that thing is in the lower triangular parts.

264
00:31:49,530 --> 00:31:52,740
So this is a much easier to solve. Agreed. Okay.

265
00:31:53,310 --> 00:31:57,710
How do we solve? Well, last call.

266
00:31:57,810 --> 00:32:02,030
Last row. We have only just one. There is not nothing else.

267
00:32:02,030 --> 00:32:13,650
So last row is a super easy to solve because you have this means that you multiply this only x of n is left, so x of pn is equal to b of and star.

268
00:32:13,890 --> 00:32:19,590
Okay, so if went star whatever it was calculate does that should be just of seven and

269
00:32:19,740 --> 00:32:23,700
your this is called backwards three because I now know what the X of PN is.

270
00:32:24,090 --> 00:32:26,700
Now let's use this. The second row.

271
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:35,220
The second row is basically X of n minus one plus you star of nice one times x of n, but I know what the x of n values are.

272
00:32:35,610 --> 00:32:42,959
So now you just use this simple rule to calculate backward what the x over and minus one x of n minus two is.

273
00:32:42,960 --> 00:32:51,480
So on. Okay. So you can use these are these steps to to solve this.

274
00:32:51,690 --> 00:33:03,120
Okay. So, so basically you are just a, you know, rewriting the matrix in a slightly different way to solve this equation.

275
00:33:04,090 --> 00:33:09,400
What do you think the comp time complexity of these algorithms?

276
00:33:14,120 --> 00:33:20,580
They looked very complicated. You have to like convert the matrix and so on.

277
00:33:20,600 --> 00:33:27,160
So this this doesn't seem to be very easy, but actually you can do this only conceptually.

278
00:33:27,170 --> 00:33:34,400
You don't have to rewrite the matrix every time. What you need to do is you just need to calculate these three values.

279
00:33:35,390 --> 00:33:40,370
Right. So this is a this is actually for three evolve you just need to calculate this.

280
00:33:40,420 --> 00:33:47,690
You knew this. This is the part you need to do and you just need to do it over a single loop.

281
00:33:47,990 --> 00:33:56,870
So this is a linear time complexity. And when you do the backward sweep, you're just doing it again backward.

282
00:33:57,170 --> 00:34:08,120
This is also a single look. This is linear time. So we just converted, apparently two cubic time complex delivery them into linear time,

283
00:34:08,120 --> 00:34:20,360
out of rhythm by leveraging the fact that this is a binary matrix where the only three elements are non-zero at the at the end in any given row.

284
00:34:20,750 --> 00:34:23,840
So that's that's what we just did. Okay.

285
00:34:24,500 --> 00:34:32,040
So you don't really have to you know, you don't have to implement this cubic spline every time.

286
00:34:32,180 --> 00:34:43,290
Obviously, that that's not the. The the core part of this and I don't know if so this track this is called Friday econometrics with

287
00:34:43,290 --> 00:34:50,819
them and this is are only of only working when you have a this specific condition but you get the idea,

288
00:34:50,820 --> 00:34:55,620
right. So when you have when your matrix of a spatial structure,

289
00:34:55,620 --> 00:35:03,570
in a lot of cases you will you have you deal with the banded matrix or some sort of matrix that has a lot of zeros of diagonal.

290
00:35:03,600 --> 00:35:10,260
Right. And in that case, you can use you can there is this kind of particle overlays and you can implement yourself and try to solve it,

291
00:35:10,680 --> 00:35:17,850
or at least try to find an algorithm that leverages this structure to reduce your time complexity a lot.

292
00:35:17,850 --> 00:35:24,030
And, you know, so then, then if you didn't know, this is like if someone asked you,

293
00:35:24,030 --> 00:35:29,009
oh, can you, can you fit to explain with a million points then oh it's impossible.

294
00:35:29,010 --> 00:35:32,610
Yeah. You know, come back next year then I'm going to come back and come back.

295
00:35:32,820 --> 00:35:37,950
I'll come back with your answer. But now you could say that.

296
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:43,290
Oh, I can do it in just 10 seconds. Okay. So that's possible, right?

297
00:35:43,290 --> 00:35:46,949
So that that's the that's the important part of the computation.

298
00:35:46,950 --> 00:35:55,889
Sometimes when you work with a very large scale data, these kind of these might be very trivial detail for some people,

299
00:35:55,890 --> 00:36:00,090
but these these things make becomes game changer when you.

300
00:36:00,360 --> 00:36:05,910
So sometimes this kind of inference becomes possible when you when you thought that it was impossible.

301
00:36:06,090 --> 00:36:19,310
Okay. So this is this is the main part I wanted to go back go to in a this you can use this trigonometric equation to solve this a of two.

302
00:36:19,590 --> 00:36:23,180
Okay? Because of that, that's this one representation, this triangle.

303
00:36:23,310 --> 00:36:29,550
Oh, to start with them and it wants you solve it a of two you can solve a one of three.

304
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:36,000
Okay, so those are the height of a part I wanted to get through.

305
00:36:36,330 --> 00:36:42,660
And now if you didn't believe that this actually worked, which is a totally, totally,

306
00:36:44,660 --> 00:36:49,830
totally good idea, actually very good attitude, there's a mathematically vigorous person.

307
00:36:50,250 --> 00:36:58,380
So let's try to see whether this actually is true, that the trigonometric forum a game is indeed correct.

308
00:36:59,790 --> 00:37:05,990
Okay. Any questions so far? Okay.

309
00:37:07,850 --> 00:37:12,500
So we're going to plug a bunch of equations, as I said.

310
00:37:12,680 --> 00:37:17,030
So first, the equation we're going to plug in is a continuity equation.

311
00:37:17,030 --> 00:37:20,570
Where it is, there's an equation one in two.

312
00:37:20,890 --> 00:37:26,300
Okay, we're going to use equation one and two. So the equation one, we just have this.

313
00:37:26,510 --> 00:37:30,530
Right. Okay. Equation two, we have this.

314
00:37:30,950 --> 00:37:42,920
Okay. So then if you subtract the from the second equation to the first equation, then you just get this part.

315
00:37:43,220 --> 00:37:52,820
Okay? And Y. Amos, one minus y is defined as a delta I and there was an eight.

316
00:37:53,090 --> 00:38:01,129
So these are a Delta I and H of I because if you remember, this is a this is how Delta I was defined.

317
00:38:01,130 --> 00:38:05,180
So these are if you subtract them, that that can be replaced.

318
00:38:05,180 --> 00:38:09,350
The delta of H of I. So you said there was a H of I,

319
00:38:09,350 --> 00:38:17,850
but as you see that H of well H of eight +13 over eight plus one there was a one over one was multiplied

320
00:38:17,870 --> 00:38:24,050
h and that those are cancel out and now this is a quadratic form of H in terms of H of a plus one.

321
00:38:24,440 --> 00:38:35,850
So this is just a merely the combination of those first two and do just represent in terms of Delta is that Y.

322
00:38:35,870 --> 00:38:41,390
So this was a simple equation, but let's say this is equivalent five because I'm going to reuse it later.

323
00:38:43,070 --> 00:38:51,410
Okay. And from three, which means that you need to have a continuity in terms of the first or the derivative.

324
00:38:52,160 --> 00:38:55,490
And that's this is it.

325
00:38:55,610 --> 00:39:04,540
Okay. Okay. So and you also have a second or the second order derivative here.

326
00:39:04,550 --> 00:39:17,570
So this one's right. So you have that the second derivative, you can you can you can use this to represent this way.

327
00:39:17,630 --> 00:39:31,460
Okay. So here so the poor part of this slide is that I'm going to represent a one everything else in terms of a of two,

328
00:39:31,640 --> 00:39:36,980
because that's what I'm going to focus on later. Okay. So here you have this.

329
00:39:37,250 --> 00:39:45,100
Okay. So well, this one, because this is a derivative, it's convenient that you don't have any A1 or a zero.

330
00:39:45,110 --> 00:39:49,850
So I'm going to represent the A of three as a function of a of two.

331
00:39:49,860 --> 00:40:01,880
So if I find the quadratic equation for the quadratic part, then I will get the cubic coefficient immediately.

332
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:05,300
Okay. And this one.

333
00:40:05,870 --> 00:40:15,380
Okay, if you plug a of three here into here that that is a basically becomes a function of a of one and a of two only.

334
00:40:15,920 --> 00:40:24,770
So I'm not going to write it down, but you can if you are very quick calculator of the mathematical equation,

335
00:40:24,770 --> 00:40:28,579
you you might be able to see that this is equivalent to this.

336
00:40:28,580 --> 00:40:39,250
So basically 23h is a so 238 is gone and you have a two minus eight, eight, eight.

337
00:40:39,260 --> 00:40:42,440
So this subtraction between those two.

338
00:40:43,190 --> 00:40:48,440
And so now now you have you have two terms of these.

339
00:40:48,440 --> 00:40:52,399
So, so one, two, one time, one time will be gone.

340
00:40:52,400 --> 00:40:56,840
So and you can move things around that then you will have this.

341
00:40:57,050 --> 00:41:05,240
Okay. So it's not, it's not super straightforward, but it's not it's not very complicated either.

342
00:41:05,420 --> 00:41:16,430
Okay. Okay. So, so now so this part is just to show that you can represent a whenever you see a three and a one,

343
00:41:16,760 --> 00:41:20,629
you're going to basically you use a representation.

344
00:41:20,630 --> 00:41:26,650
They use a of two. Okay? In this equation, we had it before.

345
00:41:26,690 --> 00:41:30,320
So with the number five, we have this equation before.

346
00:41:30,800 --> 00:41:36,470
Now let's represent this as a so.

347
00:41:36,980 --> 00:41:44,270
So instead. So it instead of using this part, let's get rid of a of three.

348
00:41:44,630 --> 00:41:47,650
Then you can have this equation.

349
00:41:47,900 --> 00:41:58,310
Okay. So and because this works with that, I have one, two in my one, you also have the equation.

350
00:41:58,970 --> 00:42:02,660
So just to change a time and so on in the equivalent equation.

351
00:42:02,840 --> 00:42:06,170
Okay. Now if you subtract B.

352
00:42:06,490 --> 00:42:11,309
Those two. Okay. Then because you have this equation,

353
00:42:11,310 --> 00:42:17,010
the subtraction between two a ones in the in the nearby junction can be also

354
00:42:17,010 --> 00:42:22,740
represented a of two so subtracted and represent a everything is a of two.

355
00:42:23,070 --> 00:42:27,450
That's what it what what is trying to do all these derivation is basically trying

356
00:42:27,450 --> 00:42:32,700
to represent everything is a in terms of quadratic coefficient and you have

357
00:42:32,700 --> 00:42:38,639
this so I didn't derive everything but I think each of the step is a modular

358
00:42:38,640 --> 00:42:44,070
enough that you can you can reproduce it usually by plugging in other equations,

359
00:42:44,070 --> 00:42:54,930
but that's where, where we are now. So then, then the rest part is that we need to deal with the boundary conditions.

360
00:42:54,960 --> 00:43:03,650
Okay. So. So because so we have these equation A of two.

361
00:43:04,460 --> 00:43:10,520
So because because of the second derivative of the first, the plane is a zero.

362
00:43:11,090 --> 00:43:15,950
We have these this value and using this value you can.

363
00:43:17,390 --> 00:43:20,930
So at the end where I equal one in, I call in minus one.

364
00:43:20,930 --> 00:43:23,720
You need the some special treatment because you don't have this.

365
00:43:24,200 --> 00:43:30,740
So but the bottom line is that because so if are equal equal one, you actually don't have this part.

366
00:43:31,100 --> 00:43:41,179
But this this equation still holds. You can you can basically show that this equation without without this coefficient is still equivalent.

367
00:43:41,180 --> 00:43:51,649
So this works okay. And the when when, when I equal and minus one, there is a more calculation you need to do.

368
00:43:51,650 --> 00:44:02,690
But the bottom line is that you still have this equation of holding without so these parties without having these these are third parts.

369
00:44:02,690 --> 00:44:06,230
So usually so when when I call.

370
00:44:06,290 --> 00:44:13,880
So what is what is showing is that when I equal one or so, when I equal one, these party can be ignored.

371
00:44:14,230 --> 00:44:19,790
The equation still holds when I equal minus one, this part can be ignored.

372
00:44:19,790 --> 00:44:28,129
The equation still holds. Okay, so that's what it shows. Okay, so this part in this part that this is a derivation that that works.

373
00:44:28,130 --> 00:44:35,210
Basically, if you use the leverage, the effect that the second derivative is zero, you will get this.

374
00:44:35,540 --> 00:44:40,159
Okay, so that's why you have this equation.

375
00:44:40,160 --> 00:44:48,080
So from the second to the from the second and in minus to second row,

376
00:44:48,650 --> 00:44:54,620
there is a three coefficient in the first and last row you have a two coefficient.

377
00:44:55,130 --> 00:45:00,140
Okay. But these, these works very nicely you mentioned.

378
00:45:02,810 --> 00:45:14,770
Okay. So, so that that explains the most of this cubic spline part and we can go through the exercise before going through the exercise.

379
00:45:14,790 --> 00:45:18,820
Any questions? Okay.

380
00:45:20,080 --> 00:45:32,260
So again, most of you will be will be the user of this cubic spline rather than being developers.

381
00:45:32,680 --> 00:45:36,940
But still, I think this is a good exercise to try.

382
00:45:37,660 --> 00:45:44,530
And because the decision to use so much and understanding how this works is actually quite useful.

383
00:45:44,830 --> 00:45:51,760
So I suspect that I need to load a lot of cells here.

384
00:45:51,760 --> 00:46:03,249
So let me just try to load everything because I so I'm using a lot of, uh, a lot of equations here.

385
00:46:03,250 --> 00:46:11,410
So let me just we do what we have done last lecture, even though, you know, we're not going to use everything because that's in here.

386
00:46:12,580 --> 00:46:19,690
So yeah, we've finished a piecewise linear interpolation and so we probably will use these

387
00:46:19,690 --> 00:46:24,370
piecewise ever poly function again because this is still polynomial function piecewise.

388
00:46:25,690 --> 00:46:30,730
So that's the okay, so let's, let's go to the nature of cubic.

389
00:46:31,150 --> 00:46:38,370
So this is a try, try diagonal matrix solving with them.

390
00:46:38,680 --> 00:46:50,350
Okay. So, uh, so we, we're just implementing this particular part with a simple loop, so we're going through the loop, okay?

391
00:46:50,350 --> 00:46:56,469
So finding the you want and b one so you want and B one is a new basically you start in B start.

392
00:46:56,470 --> 00:47:08,770
I'm just updating instead of the making new, you start here. So why do boundary conditions hold this one or this one?

393
00:47:08,770 --> 00:47:15,220
You mean y. So as I said, this is not mathematically justifiable.

394
00:47:16,060 --> 00:47:20,379
This is so you just need to give us two more equation.

395
00:47:20,380 --> 00:47:28,120
You have a four minus so you, you have a format for n minus six equations based on this condition.

396
00:47:28,600 --> 00:47:37,950
So you need to provide two equations more, two additional more equations to, uh, to make this solvable problem.

397
00:47:38,210 --> 00:47:49,780
Right? So this is another of identifiable problem as it is, and you need to make some extra assumption on the two to be able to solve and you can.

398
00:47:49,990 --> 00:47:54,940
So because of this boundary, there is no guarantee that this has to be tied into something else.

399
00:47:54,940 --> 00:48:02,400
You just make to make arbitrary assumptions. And these two two assumptions particularly is an arbitrary assumption.

400
00:48:02,410 --> 00:48:10,900
You can you can say, oh, y y this is a true thing. So this is just, you know, there is no reason this is true.

401
00:48:11,080 --> 00:48:20,340
You can make other assumptions, but if you make this assumption first, this is reasonable assumption because at the end,

402
00:48:20,360 --> 00:48:23,620
you if you wanted to be able to extrapolate,

403
00:48:24,160 --> 00:48:31,030
you need to make some assumption about the what the behavior of the derivatives, you know, after the boundary.

404
00:48:31,420 --> 00:48:38,350
So this is one assumption that, oh, I want to make the second derivative of zero because I'm making the first derivative,

405
00:48:38,350 --> 00:48:41,649
as you know, where certain value seems less like less natural.

406
00:48:41,650 --> 00:48:44,750
So that's so natural. This is called natural.

407
00:48:44,750 --> 00:48:52,660
Critics explained this is subjective, but I think many people will agree that the you know, that that will make the function reasonably nice.

408
00:48:53,200 --> 00:48:56,860
That's 1111 explanation.

409
00:48:57,790 --> 00:49:02,230
And after that, it also makes the equation much cleaner.

410
00:49:02,380 --> 00:49:07,600
So if you didn't have that boundary condition, this would be much messier, this part and this part.

411
00:49:08,050 --> 00:49:16,540
Okay. So that that tells us that, oh, there's something special with the particular assumption because it makes the equation much cleaner.

412
00:49:17,050 --> 00:49:20,110
That is this is a probably natural thing to do. Okay.

413
00:49:20,140 --> 00:49:23,890
So that's another way to explain it. Okay. Yeah, yeah.

414
00:49:23,890 --> 00:49:30,070
Good question. Yeah. So that's definitely not not straightforward to understand.

415
00:49:31,630 --> 00:49:34,900
Okay. So we're just trying to implement that these are to them.

416
00:49:34,990 --> 00:49:44,260
Okay. So then so this, this is just going through the loop to implement the for is for sweep.

417
00:49:44,710 --> 00:49:52,750
Now you have a newly defined the values of a B and you so which is a just a piece to replace the value of B star.

418
00:49:52,750 --> 00:50:01,600
And you start now assuming that B and you contains a B star in the new star, you can now back to the square sweep.

419
00:50:01,600 --> 00:50:09,669
I'm going to solve the equation for the X event first and I the I'm going backward from the from the bottom row,

420
00:50:09,670 --> 00:50:13,330
from the first row to solve this all part.

421
00:50:15,090 --> 00:50:18,190
Okay. So.

422
00:50:18,190 --> 00:50:22,450
And this is a cubic supply. It's a very long.

423
00:50:22,810 --> 00:50:31,640
Okay, let me try to explain it. So first part is a pretty much a similar to the linear piecewise linear interpolation.

424
00:50:31,660 --> 00:50:37,660
We are just getting the input and try to order the input in the in the other way.

425
00:50:37,660 --> 00:50:45,620
Because when you give, when you use a cubic supply, when you give an X and Y, the users may not necessarily know that the input has to be sorted.

426
00:50:45,640 --> 00:50:55,060
So we're just making sure that input is sorted by the X values just to to to make sure that this doesn't break things.

427
00:50:55,420 --> 00:51:01,930
Okay. After that, this is just the implementation of all these different things.

428
00:51:02,530 --> 00:51:10,740
But basically, these calculate the H and G and we using the all the aspect operations, then this is a08.

429
00:51:10,750 --> 00:51:21,579
So then a zero can be easily calculated because a zero is just simply the value of the Y value for each of the each of those points,

430
00:51:21,580 --> 00:51:28,960
except for the last value. Because if there's a n minus one equation and then a two, we are solving it first using this triangle on matrix operation.

431
00:51:29,070 --> 00:51:40,240
Right. So when we do the when you when you do the trigonometric solver, you will see that this only solves for the the H2 value,

432
00:51:40,240 --> 00:51:47,450
excluding the first and last value and the first and last value by plugging into this boundary condition.

433
00:51:47,520 --> 00:51:51,009
You can see that the first values are second.

434
00:51:51,010 --> 00:51:54,340
There is three v. So this is what you have. Okay.

435
00:51:58,920 --> 00:52:02,980
Sorry. Sorry. Um, I think I. I didn't.

436
00:52:04,230 --> 00:52:07,950
So that's the value is not. It does not have to be calculated.

437
00:52:08,070 --> 00:52:12,090
So let me, let me just to make sure. So, yeah.

438
00:52:12,360 --> 00:52:18,479
So you have minus one. You just need. So we are this is a PN minus two equations, so you just need one more value.

439
00:52:18,480 --> 00:52:22,650
I'm sorry. So. So last one. There is nothing. Nothing that was appended.

440
00:52:22,770 --> 00:52:26,370
I misread it. So you just add what?

441
00:52:26,730 --> 00:52:29,040
So to add a boundary condition you have,

442
00:52:29,070 --> 00:52:39,150
you add a zero in the first value of a to these part in total is a solving to try try, try, try that on a matrix.

443
00:52:40,920 --> 00:52:49,050
And if you have a two now you calculate the eight three and a one using the equation that was describing this slide.

444
00:52:49,350 --> 00:52:56,999
Now you have all the coefficient, you have 48081282 and eight three as a sort of a matrix form.

445
00:52:57,000 --> 00:53:08,280
So this is a matrix form that is and minus one different value for each of those spline junctions and for coefficient.

446
00:53:08,880 --> 00:53:09,120
Okay.

447
00:53:10,320 --> 00:53:27,990
Now this, uh, this plane function is basically e to the, this is a routine that does apply this plane approximation to return the interpolated value.

448
00:53:28,320 --> 00:53:32,729
So what is part is that, oh, this is a new value.

449
00:53:32,730 --> 00:53:43,620
I want to interpolate in arbitrary value then it's a pretty similar to what I had done before with a piecewise linear interpolation.

450
00:53:43,620 --> 00:53:54,040
But basically I'm going to expand the boundary beyond the first and last point and figure out the each of the point,

451
00:53:54,040 --> 00:53:58,560
the which interval that belongs to the calculate them.

452
00:53:59,100 --> 00:54:02,700
So when it when it belongs to a specific interval,

453
00:54:03,120 --> 00:54:17,010
I'm going to update the Y value using the using the polynomial evaluator and I just using that interpolation for each of those interval.

454
00:54:18,030 --> 00:54:32,090
Then that's what I do if. So this one has a special spatial value where if you have only if if you have a quadratic function.

455
00:54:32,100 --> 00:54:37,020
So this one is that if an equal to then there is some spatial thing you need to do.

456
00:54:37,020 --> 00:54:49,370
I think this plane. The function assumes that this is a you have three or more points, but if you have a two points, you just apply applied.

457
00:54:49,490 --> 00:54:56,960
So this is a this is not really important. And if there's only one value, is just the return a constant value.

458
00:54:57,060 --> 00:55:04,650
Okay. So that's what it does. So. So basically if you have a two points, usually in a interpolation,

459
00:55:04,670 --> 00:55:09,980
if you have one point to use the constant otherwise use plane so that that's what it is.

460
00:55:11,180 --> 00:55:19,920
So. Then, uh, and this is just a polynomial interpolation function, basically.

461
00:55:20,120 --> 00:55:26,840
It's a, we already have done this, so this is just polynomial interpolation and then we're just going to compare this.

462
00:55:27,500 --> 00:55:35,450
So let's see whether a cubic is trying to work. So it's a very simple for point of the case.

463
00:55:35,450 --> 00:55:42,680
And if you see this four point case, a previously the piecewise linear operation, it kind of worked.

464
00:55:42,830 --> 00:55:48,170
So if you see that this this is what the piecewise linear interpolation has done,

465
00:55:48,710 --> 00:55:55,280
now you have a cubic spleen that looks more smoother, so it seems working.

466
00:55:55,940 --> 00:56:02,269
So now you can try to compare how this works with this range of this phenomenon.

467
00:56:02,270 --> 00:56:06,469
So now compared to the piecewise linear case,

468
00:56:06,470 --> 00:56:18,170
it looks smoother and it doesn't go crazy like a polynomial interpolation because it only uses about two thirds of third degree polynomial.

469
00:56:18,170 --> 00:56:31,790
So there is a limitation where the error can go up to even if the value of of x is quite, you have a bit better log of multiplying a lot of errors.

470
00:56:33,080 --> 00:56:45,030
Okay. So that's I believe the end of the end of this could be explained part.

471
00:56:45,330 --> 00:56:49,770
And there is some of these questions. Okay. So this is a lot to digest.

472
00:56:49,950 --> 00:56:55,380
So I'm going to give you 3 minutes to discuss about it.

473
00:56:56,280 --> 00:57:02,430
And, uh, and, uh, yeah, let's, uh, let's move on to the next part.

474
00:57:17,930 --> 00:57:24,680
So if you have a question. Feel free to ask. Raise your hand as question after discussion.

475
00:57:49,170 --> 00:59:27,510
So. Moving on to.

476
00:59:35,900 --> 00:59:48,200
Okay. So let's get to the edge of the equation first to I think it's a straightforward I think each of them has of their own advantages over it.

477
00:59:48,290 --> 00:59:58,100
I'm not going to enumerate everything, but you know it in the easy to do implement if you have to implement like you don't if you don't have

478
00:59:58,760 --> 01:00:05,329
this lecture note or you know they'll call that the implementing nature to explain will be challenging.

479
01:00:05,330 --> 01:00:11,510
So if you have to implement yourself something quick, then I wouldn't mind doing the linear interpolation, but.

480
01:00:11,990 --> 01:00:16,250
Q Explain his advantage of being smooth and differentiable and so on.

481
01:00:17,060 --> 01:00:19,580
Okay, so in that we have a large phenomenon,

482
01:00:19,580 --> 01:00:30,409
so I don't really recommend to use a polynomial interpolation until you are sure that those errors wouldn't matter in your feeding time complexity.

483
01:00:30,410 --> 01:00:33,500
So what if a time complexity is a cubic.

484
01:00:35,200 --> 01:00:40,930
Of the that you're curious display because it's a it's a matrix operation then.

485
01:00:41,710 --> 01:00:51,130
Well, that that's true if you have a inefficient implementation, but you can make the network you explain to linear in a way.

486
01:00:51,760 --> 01:00:56,110
So this is the more interesting question. So why why would you do cubic spline?

487
01:00:56,110 --> 01:01:04,980
So why? So what kind of problem you would have if you do the quadratic plot?

488
01:01:05,170 --> 01:01:11,680
Quadratic. So second, if you use a second of the report of the formula, you can you can imagine you can do similar thing.

489
01:01:12,520 --> 01:01:19,390
What's the problem? We used the second with our second of the feeding.

490
01:01:21,540 --> 01:01:29,370
What? What do you think? What kind of problem do you think we will have if you don't have second derivative being continuous?

491
01:01:36,530 --> 01:01:43,980
Anything to do with diversion. So when we write it visually, it looks.

492
01:01:44,190 --> 01:01:48,399
It doesn't. Sometimes. Sometimes. So. Well, your.

493
01:01:48,400 --> 01:01:54,760
Your first. So that. That I would imagine. So it looks it looks continuous, much more continuous than the linear interpolation.

494
01:01:55,540 --> 01:02:03,130
But it it does look weird when you have like, let's say you have a parabola, let's say you have two.

495
01:02:03,370 --> 01:02:10,359
So two parabola coming joining both of them has exactly have a00 coefficient of one.

496
01:02:10,360 --> 01:02:16,840
One is very, very, very, very big and one is bad with a thing that, that that looks just the not right.

497
01:02:17,350 --> 01:02:22,690
So that, that visually that, that that could give us of a strange feeling.

498
01:02:22,690 --> 01:02:31,570
But also in the more importantly, you know, many are you're using like gradient descent or something.

499
01:02:32,140 --> 01:02:38,260
So if you want to use these actually as if it's a real function, a lot of cases you you want to do that.

500
01:02:38,680 --> 01:02:44,410
So then, you know, it works well for many of the algorithm because you have a derivative,

501
01:02:44,620 --> 01:02:50,770
but some are wisdom quite second derivative and that that that fails, it doesn't work.

502
01:02:50,920 --> 01:02:58,840
So it does do strange thing. So at least guaranteeing that you have a second derivative being continuous has a has advantages.

503
01:02:59,540 --> 01:03:09,339
Why not use a port order? So you can even oh you know, a third of the works in the photo the.

504
01:03:09,340 --> 01:03:13,540
Why not. You could try that first, you know.

505
01:03:13,960 --> 01:03:21,850
Have you do you know why you know middle school teaches the how the solution for the quadratic

506
01:03:21,850 --> 01:03:31,170
equation but not QB creation it's much harder to do over memorize right so but it's for photo

507
01:03:31,180 --> 01:03:38,799
the plan is a much more work it's a it's an additional layer to solve it's a very messy but more

508
01:03:38,800 --> 01:03:45,530
importantly there are a very limited number of cases you will need a third order derivative,

509
01:03:45,610 --> 01:03:57,990
right. So, so to be continuous. So that's that's the main reason I'm seeing if you have a very frequent use of a having to use a third of the order,

510
01:03:58,060 --> 01:04:02,080
some someone will develop very nice television to do that.

511
01:04:02,080 --> 01:04:06,130
So that's, that's the region from my perspective.

512
01:04:06,370 --> 01:04:10,900
Okay. So I know that there's no right. Ask any other questions.

513
01:04:13,110 --> 01:04:20,520
Okay. So now we have only 50 minutes left, which I hope that we have more.

514
01:04:21,180 --> 01:04:25,020
But let me go through some of the some of the logistics.

515
01:04:25,380 --> 01:04:36,810
Okay. So we have, uh, we have a final project coming up in two months.

516
01:04:37,230 --> 01:04:41,280
Okay. So now we need to form a group today.

517
01:04:41,820 --> 01:04:52,380
Okay. So I'm going to briefly explain what the final project is, and I'm going to explain how you know how we're going to do it.

518
01:04:52,650 --> 01:04:58,620
Okay. So it's a team project that you're you're going to most of you will be assigned with a team of three.

519
01:04:58,930 --> 01:05:04,710
There are there will be two teams that has to be going to go to, unfortunately, because if we're not.

520
01:05:05,680 --> 01:05:08,730
Yeah, we don't have exactly a multiple of three.

521
01:05:09,510 --> 01:05:14,370
Okay. So the group assignment will be random if you have.

522
01:05:15,240 --> 01:05:19,430
Yeah. That that's so that that's no exception.

523
01:05:19,440 --> 01:05:25,200
So even if you have a preferred group of members you wanted to interact with, we, we need to be alone, not here.

524
01:05:26,010 --> 01:05:31,710
So, and the project is a independent project.

525
01:05:32,280 --> 01:05:36,650
Each group should proposed a proposal their their topic.

526
01:05:36,660 --> 01:05:43,500
So. And if you have a specific research interest that you wanted to pursue,

527
01:05:43,800 --> 01:05:49,680
then if your project project is very tailored to that, your research topic, that would be ideal.

528
01:05:49,980 --> 01:05:54,990
But I also understand that many of you don't have specific topics yet.

529
01:05:54,990 --> 01:05:58,230
In that case, you know, you just team can decide, right?

530
01:05:59,250 --> 01:06:08,760
You need to do our programing. RCP is a highly encouraged and I'm going to teach you briefly how to do the RCP, but those are not required.

531
01:06:08,760 --> 01:06:17,100
But this if you can learn how to do the RCP and implement at least some a partnership, that will be good experience for you.

532
01:06:17,310 --> 01:06:24,810
Okay. And the grading will be novelty, difficulty and degree of accomplished completion and the presentation and writing.

533
01:06:24,810 --> 01:06:33,660
So those are the based on the the the rubrics that serve the grading criteria to this vision.

534
01:06:35,040 --> 01:06:41,460
Okay. So you have 25 days from now on to propose a project.

535
01:06:41,700 --> 01:06:48,479
Okay. So and there is a template that it's available here.

536
01:06:48,480 --> 01:06:52,080
So I'm you're going to see the assignment after the of the class.

537
01:06:52,080 --> 01:06:56,610
So I'm going to, uh, we need to group form a group first.

538
01:06:56,760 --> 01:07:04,980
Okay. So in the way, how you submit it is that you shared your Google document with me and GSI.

539
01:07:05,160 --> 01:07:14,450
Okay. So I am pretty sure that all of you know how to do it so that that's that important to turn your permission to comment on.

540
01:07:14,460 --> 01:07:20,700
We don't need to edit the document, but we need to be able to comment on the document so that we can give feedback.

541
01:07:20,880 --> 01:07:31,830
Okay. Okay. So and you you will be given a chance to present your project in class.

542
01:07:33,270 --> 01:07:36,780
The plan is the last two classes in December.

543
01:07:36,900 --> 01:07:40,709
I have. But because we have 15 teams.

544
01:07:40,710 --> 01:07:44,000
So that means that we will be a little bit over actually.

545
01:07:44,010 --> 01:07:47,549
So I'll have to decide like how many minutes I can give you.

546
01:07:47,550 --> 01:07:51,120
But the roughly 10 minutes is what I what I think we can afford.

547
01:07:51,900 --> 01:08:02,370
And now you need to write a final report by December 16th, which is actually the final exam date, but we don't have final exam.

548
01:08:02,370 --> 01:08:07,020
So this is the the replacement took the final exam.

549
01:08:07,300 --> 01:08:12,420
Okay. Okay. And what do you what do I choose?

550
01:08:12,420 --> 01:08:18,010
And I'm going to leave it open ended. You can you can read a lot of journals of interest here.

551
01:08:18,030 --> 01:08:24,840
So here, here. I'm just giving giving some example, but you don't definitely have to limit yourself to those journals.

552
01:08:25,290 --> 01:08:31,139
And these are the possible just, you know, possible, you know, topics.

553
01:08:31,140 --> 01:08:37,110
So if there is any so anything that that is that is a research topic.

554
01:08:37,110 --> 01:08:40,290
That is, you know, research topic has to be new. It has to be cutting edge.

555
01:08:40,300 --> 01:08:48,070
So you have very high bar. So it'll be ideal that if you make something totally new, right?

556
01:08:48,120 --> 01:08:52,200
So and the write a paper and a publishing nature, that will be ideal.

557
01:08:52,440 --> 01:08:56,010
But I don't want you I don't require you to everyone to do that.

558
01:08:56,700 --> 01:08:58,920
So, yeah.

559
01:08:58,950 --> 01:09:11,940
So what's what's ideal, you know, in there practically is that either you make something new or you can implement something that doesn't exist.

560
01:09:12,440 --> 01:09:16,940
A lot of these days, a lot of Python packages that are cool, that are very useful.

561
01:09:17,180 --> 01:09:22,480
There's no hard implementation. Those are very good targets. So I want to make all package of this.

562
01:09:22,490 --> 01:09:26,810
I am using this, but there is there was no other package, so you can do that.

563
01:09:27,150 --> 01:09:34,390
But there is some research paper that gives a very nice mathematical concept, but there is no very good software to do it.

564
01:09:34,400 --> 01:09:40,340
So those are the things you probably want to target. And I'm very happy to discuss with you during office hours.

565
01:09:40,340 --> 01:09:44,660
So if you need a consulting, please, you know,

566
01:09:44,690 --> 01:09:53,120
I only like usually the that the area I'm interested is only like genomics and genetics and special transcriptomics and those things.

567
01:09:53,120 --> 01:09:58,330
So I probably will be biased. My opinion will be biased, but I'm happy to give them some directions.

568
01:09:59,000 --> 01:10:04,390
Okay. And these are just part of a project. These are definitely not something you should do.

569
01:10:04,400 --> 01:10:13,760
This is just a possible project. Like there are some existing packages I think are making something better than this is actually very hard.

570
01:10:13,760 --> 01:10:19,680
So I know some of some of them would be bad choice because the existing packages would be really good already.

571
01:10:19,700 --> 01:10:29,299
So there is a limited amount of novelty or performance gain, but some of these are good and might be useful to try.

572
01:10:29,300 --> 01:10:36,560
And it's a if you can find a problem that is practical, useful but doesn't have the solution yet, that'll be that'll be better.

573
01:10:36,560 --> 01:10:39,320
But these are the examples. Okay.

574
01:10:39,860 --> 01:10:52,550
So and so just on topic, obviously, that's that's better and more recommended and whatever motivate your creative creativity, that will be the best.

575
01:10:54,120 --> 01:11:02,480
Okay. So and clustering single cell data, this was like, you know, now it's not that maybe clustering is special.

576
01:11:03,740 --> 01:11:12,290
The task of data would be would it be better and that there's other other examples that things are areas are always changing rapidly.

577
01:11:12,800 --> 01:11:20,580
But these are these are some of the possible algorithms. You can you can try it in a film inference, rapid inference.

578
01:11:20,690 --> 01:11:25,550
This has been you know, there's already some existing packages, but you can you can try this.

579
01:11:25,670 --> 01:11:32,360
But these are really just simple project AI. These are these simple project are so just like years before.

580
01:11:32,360 --> 01:11:38,959
So these are not necessarily cutting edge anymore. But yeah, these are all things you can, you can consider.

581
01:11:38,960 --> 01:11:49,160
And the best way is to reach out to me and GSI to try to come up with good ideas and do more to more pouring brainstorming.

582
01:11:49,550 --> 01:12:00,530
So the the reason why I am trying to scare you a little bit is because it's important to think about this more much more earlier.

583
01:12:00,530 --> 01:12:04,490
If you if you have only a few days and you don't have time to discuss with your,

584
01:12:06,890 --> 01:12:12,860
you know, your GSI, GSI or instructor, that'll be you know, it will be your limitation.

585
01:12:12,860 --> 01:12:18,860
Basically, you can change your project project topic later.

586
01:12:18,860 --> 01:12:23,659
After your project, you just need to discuss with your instructor.

587
01:12:23,660 --> 01:12:26,809
Oh, I, we thought about this. This wouldn't work.

588
01:12:26,810 --> 01:12:32,629
So we change the goal. That's okay. So try not to be too worried about.

589
01:12:32,630 --> 01:12:35,990
Oh, I promise this. I'm not going to deliver it. So don't worry about this.

590
01:12:35,990 --> 01:12:41,500
You can change that goal. But I want you to be clear enough that what you want to do.

591
01:12:41,520 --> 01:12:46,010
So you need to know what you want to do before before the end of this month.

592
01:12:46,760 --> 01:12:51,650
Okay, here we have 7 minutes.

593
01:12:52,940 --> 01:12:59,839
Populate all of the numbers here. So this is the this is the site call.

594
01:12:59,840 --> 01:13:04,100
Like they they claim that they generate the total random numbers.

595
01:13:04,430 --> 01:13:09,589
So I don't know if that's true or not, but hey, you know, I can't dispute that.

596
01:13:09,590 --> 01:13:12,830
So we're going to use the random as possible.

597
01:13:12,850 --> 01:13:19,370
I'll just click on the ones I just said, doing that in life, just to make sure that I'm doing the fair thing.

598
01:13:20,420 --> 01:13:28,250
What I'm going to do is I'm going to randomize if I do randomize, you are going to see that one to the 43 numbers, each of them.

599
01:13:28,490 --> 01:13:41,180
Okay, so one, two, three, the one, one group four or five, 6 to 1 group until 37, 38, 34, 39 is one group if your name is are 40 and 41.

600
01:13:41,180 --> 01:13:44,330
Those are pairs. One group, 42 and 43 is one.

601
01:13:44,750 --> 01:13:51,560
Okay. So that, that that's what's going to happen if one of, or one of your team member happen to drop the class,

602
01:13:52,280 --> 01:13:59,209
you're going to still have to keep up with your group if you if you.

603
01:13:59,210 --> 01:14:04,850
So two, if you if your group is two sides of two, you still need to maintain your group.

604
01:14:04,850 --> 01:14:10,280
If your main group is reduced to say to one, then you you have option to join the other groups.

605
01:14:10,430 --> 01:14:18,500
Okay. Okay. I mean, in the case someone drops it because that that that happens.

606
01:14:18,650 --> 01:14:22,640
Okay. So this is the most exciting part of this lecture ever.

607
01:14:23,210 --> 01:14:26,300
So I'm going to I'm going to do this and I'm going to post this.

608
01:14:26,300 --> 01:14:30,379
I'm going to create a group in the in here.

609
01:14:30,380 --> 01:14:35,840
But you can see probably in the video lectures, theses is the numbers you have.

610
01:14:36,350 --> 01:14:39,850
So I'm going to just copy this. Okay.

611
01:14:40,040 --> 01:14:43,700
Just slowly going over so that you can check your name.

612
01:14:44,540 --> 01:14:49,790
Okay. And put it here for now.

613
01:14:49,790 --> 01:14:54,530
And I'm going to make a group assignment after the lecture.

614
01:14:55,610 --> 01:15:06,110
Okay. And if you are curious about what the what the project template should look like, this is what it looks like.

615
01:15:06,980 --> 01:15:13,700
So this is a template. So do do do do, do do.

616
01:15:13,710 --> 01:15:19,130
Yeah. So. So you basically need to share with us and just try to use this template.

617
01:15:19,340 --> 01:15:31,520
Get rid of all the green. Yeah. Get rid of all these green and blue letters and replace it with what, what is what is necessary in ask.

618
01:15:33,710 --> 01:15:40,460
Yeah. Asking me you get you can just make a copy of it and make your write your proposal.

619
01:15:42,420 --> 01:15:51,620
Okay. That looks like they give the 4 minutes for us to start a lecture seven, which is a plenty of time,

620
01:15:51,620 --> 01:16:00,350
but it's a lot, plenty of time to start not play, time to finish, but happy to take any other questions.

621
01:16:07,530 --> 01:16:21,479
Okay. So, uh, yeah, let's, uh, let's just try then just given the overview of what this part is,

622
01:16:21,480 --> 01:16:28,500
so where we're moving to, okay, so we're handling many different things.

623
01:16:28,590 --> 01:16:38,819
So this, uh, the nice thing about the design of the A 615 is that you have very broad spectrum of things.

624
01:16:38,820 --> 01:16:44,990
You're not gonna imprecision, you're supplying interpolation, you're going need, you know,

625
01:16:45,060 --> 01:16:50,430
type programing divided concords these are all like something that usually don't get taught.

626
01:16:50,850 --> 01:16:54,719
They're going to be taught in a single lecture.

627
01:16:54,720 --> 01:16:58,680
But this is also could be could it be a little bit less focused?

628
01:16:58,830 --> 01:17:07,680
Right. Are these so you're going to we're going to go through the single dimension optimization and multidimensional optimization.

629
01:17:08,370 --> 01:17:12,840
I would consider this part is the core part of the 615.

630
01:17:13,080 --> 01:17:19,350
You definitely need to understand these optimization, numerical optimization,

631
01:17:19,800 --> 01:17:27,540
because if you take the 615 and if you don't know how to do this function, no, there is something wrong with you.

632
01:17:27,540 --> 01:17:30,960
Instructor Right. So you, you need to know this because that,

633
01:17:31,050 --> 01:17:38,340
that's what everyone would expect you to learn no matter what kind of staging or computing sections you have, you have taken.

634
01:17:38,670 --> 01:17:41,850
So we're going to go to the other things later on.

635
01:17:41,850 --> 01:17:48,430
But those are yeah, those are both optimization part is important enough.

636
01:17:48,990 --> 01:17:55,590
So lecture seven is that we're going to do the single dimension optimization first that that is the basis of these optimization.

637
01:17:55,890 --> 01:18:02,280
We are going to go a lot of details here and we're going to move to the multidimensional optimization in Lecture eight.

638
01:18:02,490 --> 01:18:10,500
So those are you know, the former for will be using these optimization techniques.

639
01:18:11,280 --> 01:18:19,770
And these are these are you know, what are the most important part I would consider as a relevant for your research.

640
01:18:20,640 --> 01:18:29,370
So and these part two will be also relevant for your midterm project to which it will be announced soon after after the of the homework.

641
01:18:30,330 --> 01:18:37,450
So yeah, that's, that's what I can explain and I can explain the first slide, but there's no point.

642
01:18:37,470 --> 01:18:42,630
So we're trying to solve the root finding problem first.

643
01:18:43,440 --> 01:18:47,129
And after that, we're going to the single dimension optimization.

644
01:18:47,130 --> 01:18:51,690
So that's what we will have. So we'll so we'll finish one minute earlier.

645
01:18:52,320 --> 01:19:06,090
Okay. Thank you. Okay. So we're going to start our office hour 26, five 526, nine five in the second floor because it'll be crowded.
