1
00:00:07,850 --> 00:00:10,215
After watching this video,

2
00:00:10,215 --> 00:00:11,550
you will be able to understand

3
00:00:11,550 --> 00:00:14,595
basic concepts about
survival analysis.

4
00:00:14,595 --> 00:00:17,580
Remember this slide that
I show a few videos

5
00:00:17,580 --> 00:00:19,200
ago when I was introducing

6
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:21,090
the generalized
linear model family.

7
00:00:21,090 --> 00:00:24,540
Well, now it's to learn
about the cat of the family.

8
00:00:24,540 --> 00:00:26,925
The last model that we
will learn in this course,

9
00:00:26,925 --> 00:00:29,640
the Cox proportional
hazards model.

10
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:32,595
Note, it does not
belong to the family,

11
00:00:32,595 --> 00:00:35,535
but you will see there are
still things in common.

12
00:00:35,535 --> 00:00:37,995
Remember also in this graph,

13
00:00:37,995 --> 00:00:41,390
the survival analysis will
give us another measure of

14
00:00:41,390 --> 00:00:45,415
association hazards that we
will interpret as rates.

15
00:00:45,415 --> 00:00:48,080
Survival analysis
is also called in

16
00:00:48,080 --> 00:00:52,040
a more generalized way,
time-to-event analysis.

17
00:00:52,040 --> 00:00:55,225
This is because you can
study time to any event.

18
00:00:55,225 --> 00:00:56,870
It was originally called

19
00:00:56,870 --> 00:01:00,470
survival analysis because the
more study event was death.

20
00:01:00,470 --> 00:01:02,990
But you can also study
time to progression,

21
00:01:02,990 --> 00:01:04,070
or time to relapse,

22
00:01:04,070 --> 00:01:06,970
or actually time to
anything that can happen.

23
00:01:06,970 --> 00:01:09,185
Examples could be
from survival of

24
00:01:09,185 --> 00:01:11,590
electric bulbs to
time to promotion,

25
00:01:11,590 --> 00:01:13,910
time to divorce, you name it.

26
00:01:13,910 --> 00:01:17,655
So now, our outcome
variable is time.

27
00:01:17,655 --> 00:01:19,920
You may be wondering,
wait a minute,

28
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:21,630
time is a continuous variable.

29
00:01:21,630 --> 00:01:23,270
So why cannot we model

30
00:01:23,270 --> 00:01:26,275
survival failure time
with linear regression?

31
00:01:26,275 --> 00:01:28,710
Well, there are two main reasons.

32
00:01:28,710 --> 00:01:32,070
First, time is hardly,
normally distributed.

33
00:01:32,070 --> 00:01:34,610
For example, in survival
for cancer patients,

34
00:01:34,610 --> 00:01:36,770
that is usually really skew,

35
00:01:36,770 --> 00:01:38,645
but that's not the
main reason because

36
00:01:38,645 --> 00:01:41,020
that could be sorted out
with a transformation.

37
00:01:41,020 --> 00:01:44,300
The main reason is that
now you have sensory,

38
00:01:44,300 --> 00:01:47,825
which means that some of the
ratios will be incomplete.

39
00:01:47,825 --> 00:01:50,510
Let's go deep into the
concept of sensory because

40
00:01:50,510 --> 00:01:53,545
this is a key concept
in survival analysis.

41
00:01:53,545 --> 00:01:56,210
Although there are
other types of sensory,

42
00:01:56,210 --> 00:01:59,045
for the purposes of
introducing survival analysis,

43
00:01:59,045 --> 00:02:02,180
we're going to talk only
about right censoring.

44
00:02:02,180 --> 00:02:05,030
Right censoring happens
either because of

45
00:02:05,030 --> 00:02:08,090
loss to follow-up or because
of study domination.

46
00:02:08,090 --> 00:02:09,305
If you look at the graph,

47
00:02:09,305 --> 00:02:12,410
you can see that the
second and fourth patients

48
00:02:12,410 --> 00:02:14,360
had the event during the study.

49
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:16,475
So time is complete for them.

50
00:02:16,475 --> 00:02:18,795
But patient 3 and patient 6

51
00:02:18,795 --> 00:02:21,170
were last to follow
up during the study,

52
00:02:21,170 --> 00:02:23,995
and we didn't know if they
had the event later or not.

53
00:02:23,995 --> 00:02:26,780
Furthermore, patients
1 and 5 finished

54
00:02:26,780 --> 00:02:30,350
their study after more
or less 365 days,

55
00:02:30,350 --> 00:02:32,000
and did not have the event.

56
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,130
But we don't know if they will

57
00:02:34,130 --> 00:02:36,560
never had the event
in their lives,

58
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:38,645
or they may have it much later.

59
00:02:38,645 --> 00:02:40,040
So the nice thing about

60
00:02:40,040 --> 00:02:42,800
survival analysis is
that you can still use

61
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:45,230
that sensory information because

62
00:02:45,230 --> 00:02:47,770
still person-time without event.

63
00:02:47,770 --> 00:02:50,820
So when do you use time
to event analysis?

64
00:02:50,820 --> 00:02:52,265
Clearly you need follow-up.

65
00:02:52,265 --> 00:02:53,510
So you cannot do that in

66
00:02:53,510 --> 00:02:55,100
a cross-sectional study or

67
00:02:55,100 --> 00:02:57,965
a case-control study,
you're modeling time.

68
00:02:57,965 --> 00:03:00,110
But you can do it
in cohort studies

69
00:03:00,110 --> 00:03:01,790
and experimental studies.

70
00:03:01,790 --> 00:03:05,180
The typical representation of
time-to-event analysis that

71
00:03:05,180 --> 00:03:06,380
you have probably seen in

72
00:03:06,380 --> 00:03:08,930
many papers are the
Kaplan-Meier curves.

73
00:03:08,930 --> 00:03:11,705
We will go back to this
in the following videos.

74
00:03:11,705 --> 00:03:14,210
But basically, this is
a representation of

75
00:03:14,210 --> 00:03:16,660
the survival experience
of your groups.

76
00:03:16,660 --> 00:03:19,140
As time goes by, more
people are having

77
00:03:19,140 --> 00:03:21,720
the event until eventually,

78
00:03:21,720 --> 00:03:24,390
everyone has it or
the study terminates.

79
00:03:24,390 --> 00:03:28,075
Your goal is to compare which
group has better survival.

80
00:03:28,075 --> 00:03:30,920
As mentioned before,
calling it survival is

81
00:03:30,920 --> 00:03:32,540
relative since it depends

82
00:03:32,540 --> 00:03:34,505
on the type of event
you're studying.

83
00:03:34,505 --> 00:03:36,910
But let's imagine
these two examples.

84
00:03:36,910 --> 00:03:39,020
One is a cohort study in which

85
00:03:39,020 --> 00:03:41,450
we follow up two groups of people

86
00:03:41,450 --> 00:03:43,910
that are identified at

87
00:03:43,910 --> 00:03:47,315
baseline as the happy group
and the unhappy group.

88
00:03:47,315 --> 00:03:49,280
If I tell you that
the graph below

89
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:51,274
represents their
survival experience,

90
00:03:51,274 --> 00:03:54,500
that is how the two groups
die over the years,

91
00:03:54,500 --> 00:03:56,810
do you think it makes
sense that group 1

92
00:03:56,810 --> 00:03:59,530
is the happy group and
group 2 is the unhappy?

93
00:03:59,530 --> 00:04:01,850
Well, if you believe
that happiness is

94
00:04:01,850 --> 00:04:04,085
associated to degrees
overall mortality?

95
00:04:04,085 --> 00:04:05,740
Definitely, yes.

96
00:04:05,740 --> 00:04:09,300
How about the second example,
the experimental one?

97
00:04:09,300 --> 00:04:10,930
You have one clinical trial,

98
00:04:10,930 --> 00:04:12,664
and the figure is represented,

99
00:04:12,664 --> 00:04:15,380
the survival experience
of the two groups

100
00:04:15,380 --> 00:04:17,480
randomly assigned to the new drug

101
00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:19,375
you're testing or the placebo.

102
00:04:19,375 --> 00:04:22,070
Did you think that group
1 is the new drug,

103
00:04:22,070 --> 00:04:23,890
and group 2 is the placebo?

104
00:04:23,890 --> 00:04:26,900
Well, if you have some
faith in the new drug,

105
00:04:26,900 --> 00:04:28,300
and you think that it has

106
00:04:28,300 --> 00:04:30,100
an effect on reduced immortality?

107
00:04:30,100 --> 00:04:31,850
Definitely, yes.

108
00:04:31,850 --> 00:04:35,019
Now one final example
taken from the literature.

109
00:04:35,019 --> 00:04:37,000
You can see that you
can use this type of

110
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,425
analysis in any type of study.

111
00:04:39,425 --> 00:04:43,415
This was an experiment carried
out in hospital wards.

112
00:04:43,415 --> 00:04:46,405
The scientists left
two different brands

113
00:04:46,405 --> 00:04:48,105
of chocolates in wards.

114
00:04:48,105 --> 00:04:49,780
They measure how long did it

115
00:04:49,780 --> 00:04:51,770
take for the chocolate
to disappear.

116
00:04:51,770 --> 00:04:54,175
So what can you conclude
from this graph?

117
00:04:54,175 --> 00:04:56,500
Well, clearly, people working in

118
00:04:56,500 --> 00:04:58,840
those hospital wards
like the Roses branch

119
00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:00,280
operate much better than

120
00:05:00,280 --> 00:05:01,830
the Quality Street brand

121
00:05:01,830 --> 00:05:04,125
because they are
disappearing faster.

122
00:05:04,125 --> 00:05:06,600
What are the things
you can conclude?

123
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:09,740
Maybe that people have
too much extra free time,

124
00:05:09,740 --> 00:05:12,470
so they can conduct these
type of experiments.

125
00:05:12,470 --> 00:05:14,270
Well, this is actually one

126
00:05:14,270 --> 00:05:16,040
of those things that
are published in

127
00:05:16,040 --> 00:05:17,480
the Christmas issue of

128
00:05:17,480 --> 00:05:21,610
the VMJ that is actually
devoted to finding things.

129
00:05:21,610 --> 00:05:23,610
In summary, in this video,

130
00:05:23,610 --> 00:05:25,580
we learned the most
basic concepts

131
00:05:25,580 --> 00:05:27,259
of our survival analysis.

132
00:05:27,259 --> 00:05:29,570
In the next video, we
will keep learning

133
00:05:29,570 --> 00:05:33,483
some more basic concepts
about survival analysis.
