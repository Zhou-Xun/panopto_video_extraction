1
00:00:08,910 --> 00:00:11,590
This module is going
to focus on some of

2
00:00:11,590 --> 00:00:13,810
the key concepts in
water pollution.

3
00:00:13,810 --> 00:00:15,760
Living in the United
States we're incredibly

4
00:00:15,760 --> 00:00:18,335
fortunate that most of
us can walk to a tap,

5
00:00:18,335 --> 00:00:19,690
turn on the tap, and we

6
00:00:19,690 --> 00:00:21,490
get safe clean
drinking water out.

7
00:00:21,490 --> 00:00:23,530
Unfortunately, that's
not the case for

8
00:00:23,530 --> 00:00:25,600
many areas in the
world where people are

9
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:27,625
experiencing either no access to

10
00:00:27,625 --> 00:00:30,490
safe drinking water or
heavily polluted water.

11
00:00:30,490 --> 00:00:32,050
So in this module,
we'll be talking

12
00:00:32,050 --> 00:00:33,820
about how we can come
into contact with

13
00:00:33,820 --> 00:00:35,170
water pollution and in

14
00:00:35,170 --> 00:00:37,840
the future we'll explore
how it can be reduced.

15
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:40,300
I'd like to begin by returning to

16
00:00:40,300 --> 00:00:42,130
the notion of exposure pathways.

17
00:00:42,130 --> 00:00:43,820
So how might we be exposed

18
00:00:43,820 --> 00:00:45,830
to pollutants that
are waterborne?

19
00:00:45,830 --> 00:00:47,315
This image has been shown in

20
00:00:47,315 --> 00:00:48,830
other modules looking
at things like

21
00:00:48,830 --> 00:00:50,015
air pollution but we'll focus

22
00:00:50,015 --> 00:00:51,560
specifically on
water in this one.

23
00:00:51,560 --> 00:00:53,690
So that's the blue body of water

24
00:00:53,690 --> 00:00:56,270
on the left lower
side of the image.

25
00:00:56,270 --> 00:00:58,460
What are ways that
pollutants might get into

26
00:00:58,460 --> 00:01:00,590
water and then come into
contact with humans?

27
00:01:00,590 --> 00:01:02,180
Well, we might have
a liquid chemical

28
00:01:02,180 --> 00:01:03,770
release or a release of

29
00:01:03,770 --> 00:01:07,655
a biological or physical agent
directly into the water.

30
00:01:07,655 --> 00:01:09,920
That water may then
be taken in by

31
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:11,690
aquatic species and then

32
00:01:11,690 --> 00:01:13,550
maybe we eat those
aquatic species.

33
00:01:13,550 --> 00:01:15,800
So there's a food
chain pathway there.

34
00:01:15,800 --> 00:01:18,350
We may also use that
water to irrigate

35
00:01:18,350 --> 00:01:21,740
our crops or water our animals
that we then use for food.

36
00:01:21,740 --> 00:01:25,415
So there's another type
of a food chain pathway.

37
00:01:25,415 --> 00:01:28,280
It's possible that
we drink that water

38
00:01:28,280 --> 00:01:29,885
directly out of the source

39
00:01:29,885 --> 00:01:32,090
maybe with treatment,
maybe without.

40
00:01:32,090 --> 00:01:35,245
So then we are directly
getting exposed to that water.

41
00:01:35,245 --> 00:01:37,880
It's also possible that
as humans we spend

42
00:01:37,880 --> 00:01:40,325
time playing at the shoreline
of this water body.

43
00:01:40,325 --> 00:01:42,680
We're getting contaminated
mud and water onto

44
00:01:42,680 --> 00:01:45,590
our skin and we might have
a dermal exposure that way.

45
00:01:45,590 --> 00:01:48,170
So there are many ways that
we can come into contact with

46
00:01:48,170 --> 00:01:49,370
water pollutants other than

47
00:01:49,370 --> 00:01:51,665
just for example, drinking them.

48
00:01:51,665 --> 00:01:55,250
What are the potential types
of exposure and routes of

49
00:01:55,250 --> 00:01:56,810
exposure that are
particularly relevant

50
00:01:56,810 --> 00:01:58,625
for example, in
the United States?

51
00:01:58,625 --> 00:02:01,370
Well, we can think of a
number of different ways we

52
00:02:01,370 --> 00:02:04,100
come into contact with
potentially contaminated water.

53
00:02:04,100 --> 00:02:05,855
It could occur during bathing,

54
00:02:05,855 --> 00:02:07,550
could occur during the washing of

55
00:02:07,550 --> 00:02:10,279
our clothes and deposition
of chemicals that way,

56
00:02:10,279 --> 00:02:11,960
it might occur when
we drink things like

57
00:02:11,960 --> 00:02:13,760
tap water or it
could occur when we

58
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:15,320
use water for cleaning

59
00:02:15,320 --> 00:02:17,885
other surfaces and
have dermal contact.

60
00:02:17,885 --> 00:02:20,360
So questions
immediately arise like,

61
00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:22,880
how much water do
people actually use

62
00:02:22,880 --> 00:02:25,500
when they're drinking or
when they're cooking?

63
00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:28,165
Or how often are they exposed
when they're bathing?

64
00:02:28,165 --> 00:02:30,440
Fortunately, the Environmental
Protection Agency has

65
00:02:30,440 --> 00:02:32,870
created the Exposure
Factors Handbook.

66
00:02:32,870 --> 00:02:34,760
They basically compiled and also

67
00:02:34,760 --> 00:02:37,040
conducted a variety
of research to try to

68
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:39,095
understand human
behavior patterns

69
00:02:39,095 --> 00:02:41,150
and how humans interact
with the environment.

70
00:02:41,150 --> 00:02:43,265
So they can give
you estimates for

71
00:02:43,265 --> 00:02:46,175
how much drinking water
a child might consume,

72
00:02:46,175 --> 00:02:48,070
an adult, an elderly person.

73
00:02:48,070 --> 00:02:50,940
How many baths per day people
take and for how long?

74
00:02:50,940 --> 00:02:53,150
How much shower steam

75
00:02:53,150 --> 00:02:55,100
that might have chemical
contaminants in it?

76
00:02:55,100 --> 00:02:57,710
Do people breathe in when
they're taking a shower.

77
00:02:57,710 --> 00:02:59,180
So the EPA has already done

78
00:02:59,180 --> 00:03:01,340
our homework for us
and we're able to rely

79
00:03:01,340 --> 00:03:04,070
basically on this handbook
to come up with estimates of

80
00:03:04,070 --> 00:03:06,320
how much water people
ingest or come

81
00:03:06,320 --> 00:03:09,355
into contact with in
their daily lives.

82
00:03:09,355 --> 00:03:13,160
Zooming out from the United
States to a global level,

83
00:03:13,160 --> 00:03:14,570
how many folks actually have

84
00:03:14,570 --> 00:03:16,850
access to safe drinking water?

85
00:03:16,850 --> 00:03:19,100
It turns out that 2.1 billion

86
00:03:19,100 --> 00:03:22,400
people around the planet
lack safe drinking water at

87
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:25,790
home and about 785 million

88
00:03:25,790 --> 00:03:28,130
lack any safe drinking
water services.

89
00:03:28,130 --> 00:03:31,780
So the difference here is
some of the people in the 2.1

90
00:03:31,780 --> 00:03:33,770
billion can get safe
drinking water but they

91
00:03:33,770 --> 00:03:36,050
have to travel to a
central source to get it.

92
00:03:36,050 --> 00:03:38,840
The people in the bottom
number 785 million

93
00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:42,205
don't have any place to go
for safe drinking water.

94
00:03:42,205 --> 00:03:44,330
In 2017, there were

95
00:03:44,330 --> 00:03:47,870
a 117 countries that had
enough data to generate

96
00:03:47,870 --> 00:03:50,855
estimates for what fraction
of their population

97
00:03:50,855 --> 00:03:54,455
had access to safely managed
drinking water services.

98
00:03:54,455 --> 00:03:57,350
So in this map, the blue
and dark blue colors

99
00:03:57,350 --> 00:03:58,850
indicate countries where

100
00:03:58,850 --> 00:04:00,920
at least 75 percent of

101
00:04:00,920 --> 00:04:04,310
the population has safe
drinking water service access.

102
00:04:04,310 --> 00:04:05,870
So you can see in dark blue,

103
00:04:05,870 --> 00:04:08,270
this is effectively
countries for which

104
00:04:08,270 --> 00:04:11,180
every resident has access
to safe drinking water.

105
00:04:11,180 --> 00:04:13,385
Again, the United
States, Scandinavia,

106
00:04:13,385 --> 00:04:14,420
parts of Western Europe,

107
00:04:14,420 --> 00:04:16,640
and New Zealand are
in those colors.

108
00:04:16,640 --> 00:04:18,500
Unfortunately, if we look at

109
00:04:18,500 --> 00:04:20,630
the orange and
yellow colorations,

110
00:04:20,630 --> 00:04:24,650
these are countries where as
little as 25 percent or less

111
00:04:24,650 --> 00:04:26,750
of the population has access

112
00:04:26,750 --> 00:04:28,970
to safely managed
drinking water services.

113
00:04:28,970 --> 00:04:31,595
Here we see countries
in South America,

114
00:04:31,595 --> 00:04:35,195
Latin America, Africa,
and South Asia.

115
00:04:35,195 --> 00:04:38,930
We can also think about
access to sanitary services.

116
00:04:38,930 --> 00:04:41,780
So around the world
about 2.2 billion

117
00:04:41,780 --> 00:04:44,690
people lack basic
sanitation services,

118
00:04:44,690 --> 00:04:46,220
sanitation being a means to

119
00:04:46,220 --> 00:04:48,580
eliminate human waste
in a safe manner.

120
00:04:48,580 --> 00:04:51,380
Almost three-quarters
of a billion people are

121
00:04:51,380 --> 00:04:54,745
forced to defecate in
open surroundings.

122
00:04:54,745 --> 00:04:58,940
In 2017, 96 countries
had estimates for

123
00:04:58,940 --> 00:05:00,590
the fraction of their
population that

124
00:05:00,590 --> 00:05:02,735
had safely managed sanitation.

125
00:05:02,735 --> 00:05:05,480
In this graphic, dark green
indicates countries where

126
00:05:05,480 --> 00:05:07,265
virtually 100 percent of

127
00:05:07,265 --> 00:05:10,805
residents have access to
safely managed sanitation.

128
00:05:10,805 --> 00:05:12,200
We can see there's

129
00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:14,870
just a handful of countries
for which that applies.

130
00:05:14,870 --> 00:05:16,355
The lighter green is

131
00:05:16,355 --> 00:05:18,080
countries with at least
three-quarters of

132
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:20,435
their population with
safely managed sanitation

133
00:05:20,435 --> 00:05:21,910
that includes the United States,

134
00:05:21,910 --> 00:05:24,475
Canada, Western
Europe, Australia,

135
00:05:24,475 --> 00:05:26,170
other countries around the world.

136
00:05:26,170 --> 00:05:28,640
Then here again, yellow and red

137
00:05:28,640 --> 00:05:30,920
and orange indicate
countries where as

138
00:05:30,920 --> 00:05:32,660
little as a quarter or less of

139
00:05:32,660 --> 00:05:37,000
the population has access to
safely managed sanitation.

140
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,455
We know that the
impacts of having

141
00:05:39,455 --> 00:05:41,120
inadequate access
to drinking water

142
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:42,740
and sanitation are huge.

143
00:05:42,740 --> 00:05:44,180
About 10 percent of

144
00:05:44,180 --> 00:05:47,195
the global burden of
disease is water-related.

145
00:05:47,195 --> 00:05:49,415
The mortality rate in Africa

146
00:05:49,415 --> 00:05:51,785
is four times higher
than the global rate

147
00:05:51,785 --> 00:05:53,930
largely due to the fact
that safe drinking water

148
00:05:53,930 --> 00:05:56,440
and sanitation remain
luxuries there.

149
00:05:56,440 --> 00:05:59,510
In fact, diarrheal disease
from inadequate water and

150
00:05:59,510 --> 00:06:03,515
sanitation kills about
830,000 people every year.

151
00:06:03,515 --> 00:06:05,105
That's one child dying

152
00:06:05,105 --> 00:06:08,840
every 15 seconds from
inadequate water or sanitation.

153
00:06:08,840 --> 00:06:11,840
That's a greater toll on
children than from aids,

154
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:13,760
malaria, and measles combined.

155
00:06:13,760 --> 00:06:16,060
So water is a big deal.

156
00:06:16,060 --> 00:06:19,625
Here's a graph of the
mortality rate attributed to

157
00:06:19,625 --> 00:06:21,260
unsafe water sanitation and

158
00:06:21,260 --> 00:06:23,630
hygiene or so-called
wash services.

159
00:06:23,630 --> 00:06:25,220
So here the lighter colors

160
00:06:25,220 --> 00:06:26,930
indicate lower mortality rates.

161
00:06:26,930 --> 00:06:29,570
The darker colors indicate
higher mortality rates.

162
00:06:29,570 --> 00:06:31,550
You can see almost uniformly

163
00:06:31,550 --> 00:06:33,110
the highest mortality rates on

164
00:06:33,110 --> 00:06:35,465
the planet are located in Africa.

165
00:06:35,465 --> 00:06:37,730
Again, due to the
inadequate access

166
00:06:37,730 --> 00:06:40,685
to drinking water and
sanitary services.

167
00:06:40,685 --> 00:06:43,430
There's also though
the threat not just of

168
00:06:43,430 --> 00:06:45,620
having access to water
in the first place,

169
00:06:45,620 --> 00:06:47,885
but having access
to polluted water.

170
00:06:47,885 --> 00:06:50,540
It turns out the water
pollution threat is widespread

171
00:06:50,540 --> 00:06:53,090
and vary substantially
across the world.

172
00:06:53,090 --> 00:06:54,440
So in the map here,

173
00:06:54,440 --> 00:06:57,020
the red and yellow
colors indicate areas of

174
00:06:57,020 --> 00:06:58,970
higher water pollution threat and

175
00:06:58,970 --> 00:07:01,505
blue indicates lower
water pollution threat.

176
00:07:01,505 --> 00:07:03,380
So unlike some of
the previous maps,

177
00:07:03,380 --> 00:07:05,975
now we see Western Europe,
the United States,

178
00:07:05,975 --> 00:07:08,045
China, parts of South Asia,

179
00:07:08,045 --> 00:07:11,075
having the highest
pollution threat index.

180
00:07:11,075 --> 00:07:14,120
While we know that inadequate
drinking water access and

181
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:15,755
sanitation are directly linked

182
00:07:15,755 --> 00:07:17,520
to potentially fatal outcomes,

183
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:19,115
the health impacts of pollution

184
00:07:19,115 --> 00:07:21,235
are much less well understood.

185
00:07:21,235 --> 00:07:23,345
In fact estimates range widely.

186
00:07:23,345 --> 00:07:27,290
So in 2012, the World Health
Organization estimated that

187
00:07:27,290 --> 00:07:29,270
slightly less than a
million people died

188
00:07:29,270 --> 00:07:31,250
that year from water pollution,

189
00:07:31,250 --> 00:07:34,520
whereas the Global Burden
of Disease Study in 2015,

190
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:36,680
estimated 1.8 million people

191
00:07:36,680 --> 00:07:40,490
dying as a direct result of
water pollution every year.

192
00:07:40,490 --> 00:07:42,500
In another module we talked about

193
00:07:42,500 --> 00:07:44,945
exposure assessment
challenges for air pollution.

194
00:07:44,945 --> 00:07:47,320
They're very similar
from water pollution.

195
00:07:47,320 --> 00:07:50,180
We're again faced with this
issue that while some people

196
00:07:50,180 --> 00:07:53,000
can have quite high exposure
levels to water pollutants,

197
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:56,480
most of us have a low
level chronic exposure.

198
00:07:56,480 --> 00:07:59,030
Higher levels are much easier
typically to connect to

199
00:07:59,030 --> 00:08:02,885
health outcomes then again
these low chronic exposures.

200
00:08:02,885 --> 00:08:05,090
We also have to worry about
a mixture of chemicals.

201
00:08:05,090 --> 00:08:06,410
The pollutants in water are

202
00:08:06,410 --> 00:08:08,900
potentially many
thousands of chemicals.

203
00:08:08,900 --> 00:08:10,475
Trying to tease
out the impacts of

204
00:08:10,475 --> 00:08:12,385
each of those is
quite challenging.

205
00:08:12,385 --> 00:08:15,620
Additionally, we have
very large variability in

206
00:08:15,620 --> 00:08:17,210
the amount and types of

207
00:08:17,210 --> 00:08:19,955
water pollution over
time and over space.

208
00:08:19,955 --> 00:08:21,890
We once again are faced with

209
00:08:21,890 --> 00:08:23,720
the issue of multiple
exposure routes.

210
00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:25,040
I may be drinking lead

211
00:08:25,040 --> 00:08:27,095
inadvertently through
my tap water.

212
00:08:27,095 --> 00:08:29,960
I may also be breathing lead
from an industrial source,

213
00:08:29,960 --> 00:08:33,230
an air pollution and I could
have lead contaminated food.

214
00:08:33,230 --> 00:08:35,495
Trying to tease out the
relative importance

215
00:08:35,495 --> 00:08:36,710
of lead coming in through

216
00:08:36,710 --> 00:08:38,330
those multiple exposure routes is

217
00:08:38,330 --> 00:08:40,675
extremely challenging
but very important.

218
00:08:40,675 --> 00:08:43,805
Finally, we have the issue
of long-term exposures.

219
00:08:43,805 --> 00:08:45,650
Humans start drinking
water pretty

220
00:08:45,650 --> 00:08:47,420
shortly after birth
once they're weaned

221
00:08:47,420 --> 00:08:49,100
from breastfeeding and they drink

222
00:08:49,100 --> 00:08:51,425
water all the way up
until the day they die.

223
00:08:51,425 --> 00:08:54,049
Trying to anticipate
and understand

224
00:08:54,049 --> 00:08:56,270
someone's potential
exposures over

225
00:08:56,270 --> 00:08:58,520
70 or 80 year lifetime,

226
00:08:58,520 --> 00:09:00,805
is an extremely
challenging prospect.

227
00:09:00,805 --> 00:09:03,200
But to better understand
the impacts of

228
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:04,580
water pollution and to

229
00:09:04,580 --> 00:09:06,600
hope to control
them in the future,

230
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:07,970
we absolutely have to do

231
00:09:07,970 --> 00:09:10,720
the best exposure
assessment possible.
