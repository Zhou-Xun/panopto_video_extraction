1
00:00:01,020 --> 00:00:09,730
If you are going to work with it research, most likely you will need to do so.

2
00:00:12,230 --> 00:00:18,520
That would be the. Then why don't you have your research?

3
00:00:18,520 --> 00:00:25,080
And really, when you know what I'm going to do, then you need to talk with your base for to see exactly what you need to know.

4
00:00:25,090 --> 00:00:29,740
In some cases, you are doing data analysis.

5
00:00:29,840 --> 00:00:33,459
These cases are very detailed, these anonymous in something.

6
00:00:33,460 --> 00:00:38,830
You don't need to do that because you are not getting in contact with the human subject.

7
00:00:39,010 --> 00:00:42,910
But that will depend on the data type of data that you have.

8
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:48,160
But that will be better when you are ready to apply.

9
00:00:48,210 --> 00:00:53,440
You want to work with these, then you will know what you need to do with Eisler.

10
00:00:54,700 --> 00:01:05,560
You are working with in animal models who are planning to work in mice model, for example, that type of certification that you will need to do,

11
00:01:05,980 --> 00:01:14,260
I think I don't know whether in this semester follow or in the winter we have I like to have research with animals.

12
00:01:17,700 --> 00:01:22,370
Okay. Then why do we have an institutional review board of IAB?

13
00:01:22,740 --> 00:01:32,450
We call it. No, just the function of the job is to review and also oversight that research protocol.

14
00:01:34,590 --> 00:01:42,810
Now you are, for example, recruited participants, then the R b, the protocol has to include that informed consent.

15
00:01:43,290 --> 00:01:49,050
The participation has to be voluntary and it will have to be safety among the research participants.

16
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:56,450
Now, again, that will depend on the type of research that you are going to do, data analysis that risk what?

17
00:01:56,490 --> 00:02:04,020
Because that the data is that very connected. You are not in contact with the participants.

18
00:02:04,740 --> 00:02:14,010
Most likely you will be sent to do this because there is just a minimal risk for the participant data so far in some cases like a breach of privacy.

19
00:02:14,010 --> 00:02:17,420
Privacy. But sometimes the data is really anonymous.

20
00:02:18,510 --> 00:02:28,020
There are some exceptions to this. And also the IAB ensures that investigators, they are going to adhere to ethical standards,

21
00:02:28,020 --> 00:02:34,260
to the federal regulations and also to the policies of the university governing human side of the research.

22
00:02:35,940 --> 00:02:46,770
This is a graph here about the development of the human soldier protections yet in the United States and also in other parts of the world.

23
00:02:47,160 --> 00:02:53,940
Then we're going to talk a little bit about some of these studies, for example, the Tuskegee syphilis study.

24
00:02:54,960 --> 00:02:58,620
Also the data that you go might use in pregnant women.

25
00:02:59,940 --> 00:03:08,030
Also these about a week down. I thought about the fact that the regulations.

26
00:03:11,330 --> 00:03:17,510
They are also there. The study here that led to this study.

27
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:22,860
Yeah. Then the Nuremberg code was.

28
00:03:26,230 --> 00:03:36,220
From World after World War Two is one of the most influential, influential documents in the history of political researchers, as you know.

29
00:03:36,430 --> 00:03:44,050
After World War Two, the Nuremberg trials, there was prosecution of Nazi leaders for crimes against humanity.

30
00:03:44,740 --> 00:03:49,150
There were different type of trials that involved applications.

31
00:03:50,050 --> 00:04:00,540
It was called the doctors trial. 25 physicians from the German Nazi Party were try for crimes against humanity for all the experimentation,

32
00:04:00,550 --> 00:04:11,140
atrocious experiment that they conducted using proof of war or also political prisoners or armed groups.

33
00:04:12,130 --> 00:04:15,580
Then out of these 23, 16 were found guilty.

34
00:04:16,450 --> 00:04:18,700
Seven received death sentences out of that,

35
00:04:18,900 --> 00:04:28,000
out of the 23 and nine received prison sentence sentences ranging from ten years to life in prison, claiming seven were acquitted.

36
00:04:29,290 --> 00:04:34,060
Some people argue that more physicians needed to be tried.

37
00:04:36,910 --> 00:04:42,430
They try only 23 out of that total body that we're participating in this.

38
00:04:44,370 --> 00:04:50,450
Asians migrations. Now what are the points of the Nuremberg Code?

39
00:04:50,990 --> 00:04:55,850
Then the first is that the participation on reserve is voluntary.

40
00:04:56,600 --> 00:04:59,660
You cannot be forced to participate in any reserve.

41
00:05:01,100 --> 00:05:07,170
Now because the consent,

42
00:05:07,260 --> 00:05:15,320
the voluntary thing you need to take into account where they are so far where relationship between the researchers and the participants.

43
00:05:15,950 --> 00:05:24,320
For example, you can imagine that they have up to date of a lab and its own blood samples for two to.

44
00:05:25,910 --> 00:05:30,440
And I can ask my student, Do you want to provide me some blood sample tests?

45
00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:40,130
Then it's more likely that you want to say yes, because that is our relationship to say I don't want to my advice or to get upset,

46
00:05:41,570 --> 00:05:50,270
then that is problematic there because there is a power, then the participation has to be voluntary.

47
00:05:51,020 --> 00:05:58,940
Now that results are not going to be safe from that urine barcode, the result of any experiment must be for the greater good of society.

48
00:06:01,910 --> 00:06:05,930
The any human experiment will be based on previous animal experimentation,

49
00:06:05,930 --> 00:06:12,230
knowing that we have some kind of evidence that the experimentation that we're going to do have some likelihood

50
00:06:12,260 --> 00:06:19,670
to be successful or the experiments will be conducted avoiding physical or mental suffering and evil.

51
00:06:20,810 --> 00:06:29,160
However. Experiments should be conducted if you believe, to cause death or disability to the participants.

52
00:06:30,570 --> 00:06:36,240
That risk should never exit that defined benefits adequate facilities.

53
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:44,460
There's a web doing that research. Then we will have adequate facilities for the protection of our participants.

54
00:06:45,210 --> 00:06:48,000
Experiments will be conducted by qualified scientists.

55
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:55,290
And this is this is quite interesting because, in fact, many of the Nazi experiments were qualified scientists who are physicians.

56
00:06:59,200 --> 00:07:03,160
Important subjects should be able to end their participation of any time.

57
00:07:04,060 --> 00:07:09,870
It will be know that they cannot and they participate without, not with from us.

58
00:07:10,580 --> 00:07:16,810
Yes, I do not want to participate anymore for any reason. They don't need to give any reason to still participate, you know,

59
00:07:17,290 --> 00:07:28,990
in some cases that involve even removing data on whether or not you can imagine, for example, if.

60
00:07:30,840 --> 00:07:42,240
Working. I still I have some collaboration with them this value as one time we get some yes maybe every once in a while.

61
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:46,970
And the idea from one of our participant, I don't want to be part of that study anymore,

62
00:07:47,850 --> 00:07:58,170
that even if we don't have any more contact with a participant, we're required to remove any data from the participant from our databases.

63
00:08:00,440 --> 00:08:04,639
Even if you are not recruiting, if all the data is already collected, your participants.

64
00:08:04,640 --> 00:08:07,910
I don't want to be part of this. And you need to remove the data.

65
00:08:09,310 --> 00:08:13,480
I. So how did?

66
00:08:13,510 --> 00:08:16,720
Because I know I worked in the library, the paper records and we get electronically.

67
00:08:17,690 --> 00:08:23,840
If records record still had people that had decided to not continue, but electronically we didn't.

68
00:08:27,270 --> 00:08:30,600
It everything. Paper records, electronic records.

69
00:08:31,230 --> 00:08:35,970
Want to come back and. Yeah.

70
00:08:36,190 --> 00:08:41,500
They know that that will be exactly a new data collection product for the patient.

71
00:08:42,060 --> 00:08:48,510
Yeah. Know they have a collection. Now in some cases.

72
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:58,490
And he's in the fetal genetics now is policy from the National Institutes of Health that any

73
00:08:58,490 --> 00:09:05,660
genetic research that is funded by the government data has to be publicly available now too,

74
00:09:05,660 --> 00:09:16,430
for the data to be publicly available, you would need to to file the I would be project affordable we got 90 what I think not to Google and I need to

75
00:09:17,090 --> 00:09:25,480
to that protocol I need to propose a research and that data is anonymized meaning that no one got to validate.

76
00:09:25,490 --> 00:09:33,500
I can link the data to the person. Then they had this other protection to protect the privacy of participants.

77
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:47,829
Now then slow down. Important when your time regarding human subject protection differs, let's just aim from 50 to the 70 period there.

78
00:09:47,830 --> 00:09:57,370
What is a study was in Wichita, Kansas researcher from the University of Chicago where are you taping jury deliberations?

79
00:09:59,590 --> 00:10:04,900
So the goal of this study was to understand that jury decision making process.

80
00:10:07,710 --> 00:10:13,130
The euro. We're not told that they were recorded even by the.

81
00:10:14,510 --> 00:10:22,580
Then after publication of the findings, there was a whole discussion about the unethical nature of deceiving people for research purposes,

82
00:10:22,670 --> 00:10:26,420
purposes, and not for that breach of privacy confidentiality.

83
00:10:28,170 --> 00:10:34,010
Not now. You cannot record your deliberations.

84
00:10:34,100 --> 00:10:38,300
Now is a lot of it. Even if they agree.

85
00:10:38,930 --> 00:10:48,280
If you. Jury deliberations by the point is that they were recorded without their knowledge, like a few,

86
00:10:48,280 --> 00:10:53,310
where they answered the wrong question by saying, okay, you can't report juries anymore.

87
00:10:55,660 --> 00:10:59,290
Population. You know, you can. I think.

88
00:10:59,290 --> 00:11:04,509
What's up with that? You're right. There is there are other issues to consider.

89
00:11:04,510 --> 00:11:09,819
You can imagine, for example, you are now in our environment.

90
00:11:09,820 --> 00:11:18,060
What? I see that you already have.

91
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:24,630
But we just want to and we want to know that they are participating in that particular trial,

92
00:11:25,080 --> 00:11:31,110
because you can imagine, well, now, for example, are consequence for better for their families, for them.

93
00:11:31,500 --> 00:11:37,440
Now it is unlawful to record your already made for another population.

94
00:11:37,740 --> 00:11:44,410
I think it's legally you have. The opinion that researchers are actually recording these participants.

95
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:52,650
They need to know and they need to agree to that. Now we think around that time that in that age 50,

96
00:11:52,890 --> 00:12:00,690
the National Institute of Health created this clinical research center to oversee all the conduct of clinical research and also in the sixties,

97
00:12:00,690 --> 00:12:08,700
the IT four for the NHS to have a policy that now all the research funded by the Public Health Service by the NIH

98
00:12:09,060 --> 00:12:16,030
require at this committee review that you need to submit your rate to be there to an ethics committee to review.

99
00:12:16,050 --> 00:12:24,690
Yet in that university we had this committee that we need to. In some cases, depending on your results on time, you are going to be exempt.

100
00:12:25,140 --> 00:12:32,610
But they need to tell you that you are exempt. I imagine that,

101
00:12:32,610 --> 00:12:39,929
you know these days the case of the Toledo mine in that a50 these and you wrote that Alito

102
00:12:39,930 --> 00:12:45,509
may was used to treat discomfort associated with pregnancy for example morning sickness.

103
00:12:45,510 --> 00:12:58,409
And so the now at that time the drug was was I mean, was not a standard use of that drug.

104
00:12:58,410 --> 00:13:00,940
Was it still in research phases?

105
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:11,670
Now, thalidomide was given to pregnant women without telling them the nature of this drug, meaning that it still was in research phases.

106
00:13:15,140 --> 00:13:20,960
Now in the 62, then you apparently thalidomide caused deformities.

107
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:35,190
As a consequence of that. Now that FDA, uh, published this amendment that investigators are required to obtain informed consent before.

108
00:13:35,700 --> 00:13:39,809
I mean, is there immediate action on medications, for example, that that will be vaccine?

109
00:13:39,810 --> 00:13:48,110
You need to you need to start you. What is the most investigational vaccine?

110
00:13:54,310 --> 00:13:56,709
If that's the extinct party declaration,

111
00:13:56,710 --> 00:14:06,220
that declaration Helsinki by the War Medical Association that they met in Finland and described the standard of human studied research now in

112
00:14:06,400 --> 00:14:16,270
the importance of the importance of that declaration thinking that was said that in addition to the center principle of the Nuremberg Code,

113
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:26,200
there were two elements, two new elements. First, that interest, that subject always full, should be placed above that entire to society.

114
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:31,290
Meaning I can not say, okay, this is good for the society. People want to do harm.

115
00:14:33,630 --> 00:14:35,180
It's all with us.

116
00:14:35,410 --> 00:14:44,900
It is the interests of the participants are both that you get in society and also every subject should get the best treatment at that moment,

117
00:14:45,780 --> 00:14:52,950
they say. They say, for example, on developing a Kobe vaccine, now a new vaccine.

118
00:14:54,180 --> 00:15:00,630
Then if I'm going to compare Kobe vaccine manual one, I need to compare it to these Kobe vaccines.

119
00:15:01,590 --> 00:15:07,980
I cannot compare this new one. Leslie, I can see you because this is not the best treatment that we know that we got now.

120
00:15:08,460 --> 00:15:13,890
Every subject you get, indeed, in the trial, the best known treatment at the moment.

121
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:27,450
Now. And this is related to this study that that was the syphilis study that lasted 40 years from the theory to the seventies,

122
00:15:28,840 --> 00:15:34,860
was funded by the US Public Health Service and initially in the early thirties the

123
00:15:34,860 --> 00:15:39,420
idea was to investigate that natural history of untreated syphilis in humans.

124
00:15:40,530 --> 00:15:46,050
Now at that moment there was no treatment for syphilis, at least no effective treatment for syphilis.

125
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:56,430
Then the was investigate how the disease is going to the will of the participants with known syphilis were observed without any treatment.

126
00:15:58,260 --> 00:16:09,390
However, um, even at the start of this study, without any syphilis treatment at that moment, the study was there was serious problem for this study.

127
00:16:10,050 --> 00:16:17,010
For example, the participants were these vulnerable populations and they were usually under the payroll,

128
00:16:17,140 --> 00:16:21,030
were African American sharecroppers from Alabama. And you know what I.

129
00:16:21,270 --> 00:16:29,950
Roberts. They are.

130
00:16:29,950 --> 00:16:40,040
Usually they are. They they don't own land, so but they can use the land from another person.

131
00:16:41,210 --> 00:16:45,860
Then there is some kind of contract that they need to share that crop without.

132
00:16:46,460 --> 00:16:55,890
Now, usually there is some, you know, there. Now the problem with that in first, then there was a vulnerable population.

133
00:16:56,730 --> 00:17:04,900
And we need to be always careful when recruiting and whenever population what we said that we need to start difficulty working.

134
00:17:04,980 --> 00:17:08,040
We want to improve health in this population. We need to study.

135
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:13,110
However, we need to be careful. And they need to know the type of research that we're conducting.

136
00:17:15,040 --> 00:17:21,700
And this was all their problem because most of these parties, when they did, really didn't know what's going on.

137
00:17:23,260 --> 00:17:30,280
They didn't know what that reserve was about. In fact, most of them thought that they were receiving medical care by for the.

138
00:17:32,040 --> 00:17:36,430
They didn't know that this study was only to follow the disease.

139
00:17:38,570 --> 00:17:44,780
There was always misleading information when there was no clear information for for the participants.

140
00:17:47,610 --> 00:17:51,059
It was penicillin, like highly effective.

141
00:17:51,060 --> 00:17:54,480
I can see if it is being available, I think was in the early forties.

142
00:17:56,220 --> 00:18:04,570
However, the investigator decided to continue following Saga without treatment, even with a known treatment ceiling.

143
00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:08,880
Then in the seventies, the story was altered.

144
00:18:08,910 --> 00:18:18,510
After the West Hour, big media attention that public outrage at the web of books and articles that discussed the ethical implications of this study.

145
00:18:22,180 --> 00:18:30,090
A consequence of these type of abuses in the early seventies, the late senator from Massachusetts earlier Kennedy,

146
00:18:31,860 --> 00:18:36,300
together with other leaders from the Congress, they enacted this law,

147
00:18:36,810 --> 00:18:42,900
the National Research Act that is basically did establish that mother IRP that we.

148
00:18:47,830 --> 00:18:50,470
In the late seventies. They were all that type of report.

149
00:18:50,590 --> 00:18:59,080
The National Commission then published the Belmont Report to give more political principles guiding the conduct of human soldier researchers.

150
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:03,100
And here I just want to highlight these three principles.

151
00:19:03,580 --> 00:19:07,210
What unethical ethical are good research? The principle of respect.

152
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:12,480
Easy band. They need to give informed consent or.

153
00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:21,379
Then you can imagine if we are doing little research from kids on Tuesday, then usually their parents need to need to give their permission.

154
00:19:21,380 --> 00:19:25,220
They form consent and they need to know what what is that research about?

155
00:19:26,150 --> 00:19:30,680
We need to protect the privacy and confidentiality of our participants.

156
00:19:30,950 --> 00:19:32,180
And also, again,

157
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:40,370
participants have the right to withdraw without stopping at Northwestern ask they cannot where they can stop their participation at any time.

158
00:19:41,660 --> 00:19:46,729
That's the principle with that principle of beneficence that is maximize benefit and

159
00:19:46,730 --> 00:19:55,220
minimize harm and the principle of justice distribution of risk across society.

160
00:19:55,940 --> 00:20:05,450
This principle very important because usually we need to make sure the parties are research.

161
00:20:06,440 --> 00:20:10,010
They represent the political side that is going to get benefit from this research.

162
00:20:10,100 --> 00:20:16,670
And then if there are risks associated with that research, that risk has to be distributed across society.

163
00:20:17,250 --> 00:20:20,750
We because usually they say we.

164
00:20:22,510 --> 00:20:31,060
We are aware that to recruit second participant knowing they want to be some probability or harm or risk in our research.

165
00:20:31,180 --> 00:20:34,720
So then respect, benefits and justice.

166
00:20:38,840 --> 00:20:47,120
I don't want to vote to go to the details of the whole process that you need to do when conducting your research yet in the

167
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:56,300
university and this is that what based then what I advise is what you know that that that type what we said they going to do.

168
00:20:57,050 --> 00:21:04,129
But what your advisor with your mentor and will talk with someone that I got to be to make

169
00:21:04,130 --> 00:21:09,140
sure that type of certification that you would need to be able to conduct your research.

170
00:21:09,530 --> 00:21:15,290
Now, again, for those of you that are going to work with animal models, you would need that type of certification.

171
00:21:22,100 --> 00:21:29,000
And this is sort of the deep slide in the website and you see that?

172
00:21:29,480 --> 00:21:32,990
Yeah, I just want to point out that they both are yet to be reviewed.

173
00:21:32,990 --> 00:21:38,299
The most likely that they're going to face one that for review usually.

174
00:21:38,300 --> 00:21:44,720
I don't expect that you are going to do this. Usually this is when you are going to propose a principal investigator or a

175
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:51,380
completely new with their easy plans and you are going to go for an intervention.

176
00:21:51,680 --> 00:21:58,880
Then you tell them that is going to need that full board review. In some cases, this is, I think, one of the most likely outcome.

177
00:21:59,420 --> 00:22:07,480
You're going to have that expedited review, sometimes just one or 2% of the committee review in your application.

178
00:22:08,150 --> 00:22:16,820
Usually this happens when there is no more than minimal risk to the participants, and sometimes the IAB can decide that your research,

179
00:22:16,820 --> 00:22:19,309
even if you are working with data from your mandate,

180
00:22:19,310 --> 00:22:26,299
that you reach additional human selected reserves because the daylights out of a nice or if you can get an existing review.

181
00:22:26,300 --> 00:22:29,300
But again, that will depends on the details of the research.

182
00:22:31,690 --> 00:22:35,380
Okay. I'm no expert on the regulations.

183
00:22:36,160 --> 00:22:40,000
What I'm giving you here are the places where you need to go.

184
00:22:40,310 --> 00:22:43,780
Once you know what it would you had to be about.

185
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:52,139
Indeed, that will be the state that we need. We need to do first, identify the faculty.

186
00:22:52,140 --> 00:22:59,390
The advice for you what? We need to formulate your research with them on the study side and you will need to submit your application.

187
00:22:59,400 --> 00:23:09,000
These are the different steps that you need to follow. But again, this is why you have a research mentor and you have the investigation that you do.

188
00:23:09,210 --> 00:23:16,540
I really know what you're going to do. But if you need to complete this piece, you can do it.

189
00:23:18,170 --> 00:23:22,710
I think go to this website and the iPhone trading there that you need to complete.

190
00:23:29,610 --> 00:23:34,490
Okay. Any question? I think. You.

191
00:23:39,280 --> 00:23:43,450
But but we skipped the part about with animals and people.

192
00:23:44,050 --> 00:23:48,520
Yes. They are so moral that you need to that you don't need to do. Let's say you know what we.

193
00:23:51,250 --> 00:23:58,690
They'll make sure that you are or your certifications are updated before starting any new research.

194
00:24:03,740 --> 00:24:12,140
How long the process. Yeah. Not to the annual review for example are this to that.

195
00:24:12,320 --> 00:24:16,309
Most likely that you are going to face the expert idea or the excellent reviews.

196
00:24:16,310 --> 00:24:24,520
Just one or two weeks, maybe three weeks. WS Yes.

197
00:24:26,380 --> 00:24:35,290
Yeah, that is peer strain. Exactly. When you need to grapple with that certification and when you complete it, it depends on the train.

198
00:24:35,320 --> 00:24:40,510
I've been working with Professor Peterson with the elements training.

199
00:24:41,920 --> 00:24:45,760
It depends. Like some of them. I have to repeat them after one, you know.

200
00:24:50,930 --> 00:24:59,549
Yeah. Yup, yup. Yup. Data that was collected on human subjects but then is disconnected from them.

201
00:24:59,550 --> 00:25:06,800
You were saying them. Every IRP to use that data?

202
00:25:07,100 --> 00:25:12,030
Yes. Usually are the processes something like this.

203
00:25:12,180 --> 00:25:16,190
Say you are going to work with an advisor. Usually good adviser.

204
00:25:16,190 --> 00:25:22,010
I really have. I have been for that for you. I really have a job if you get them for that particular project.

205
00:25:22,310 --> 00:25:30,820
But any new researcher has to gain both though they want to work with that needs to have this recertification tool.

206
00:25:31,350 --> 00:25:39,400
Now then for your particular project would be that you are only have access to that data and you don't have your partner.

207
00:25:39,950 --> 00:25:46,670
You don't have any way to connect that data to any of that, to any person, to any human being in that case.

208
00:25:46,970 --> 00:25:53,810
And also, you have to say, no, I'm not going to share, because maybe your advice will have the link between the data and the person.

209
00:25:53,810 --> 00:26:00,890
But then I'm going not going to share it with you because you are going to own it in this, and that will depend on your particular research.

210
00:26:01,250 --> 00:26:07,400
Then again, the key steps are probably your advisor and probably someone in that area,

211
00:26:08,300 --> 00:26:12,410
because you need to do this online because then you will need to submit a proposal.

212
00:26:12,500 --> 00:26:16,280
What are you going to do? They are going to ask you different questions.

213
00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:21,740
Then they will decide whether they you need to provide more information for that kind of review that you are going to.

214
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:33,930
Okay. Now, you don't have more questions or comments then for our next week.

215
00:26:33,950 --> 00:26:38,210
I hear that Islamic State here is rather obdurate and.

216
00:26:42,760 --> 00:26:47,909
It. How to develop our daily writing practice then.

217
00:26:47,910 --> 00:26:55,320
Now you are going to spend this time getting academia, writing paper, writing, homework or writing.

218
00:26:57,860 --> 00:27:02,150
Of the work that we do, right? That's what we do.

219
00:27:03,470 --> 00:27:10,180
When someone asked me, okay, why did you work eight? Right. Okay.

220
00:27:10,180 --> 00:27:17,589
Then they are here. Then in this video are all nice tips about how you get a daily practice to write.

221
00:27:17,590 --> 00:27:21,910
And so some very good advice that I don't plan to follow.

222
00:27:22,180 --> 00:27:32,470
Then please watch that with you. As usual is about one hour, then follow that to its activities and you bring your are good impressions about you.

223
00:27:32,530 --> 00:27:36,490
And also I will I would like to know your own experience about writing.

224
00:27:37,300 --> 00:27:40,510
What what did you experience? What do you do to write?

225
00:27:42,010 --> 00:27:45,040
What is the best approach that work for you?

226
00:27:45,100 --> 00:27:49,900
It will be interesting to know all about that because we always get keep learning.

227
00:27:50,440 --> 00:27:54,310
Then I will. I would like to know what for your thing. Maybe I.

228
00:27:57,570 --> 00:28:10,219
Questions. Operating you have more questions are then tomorrow are for those of you that want to meet with him as a student,

229
00:28:10,220 --> 00:28:14,710
we will meet at 1 p.m. in the basement and a photo.

230
00:28:15,290 --> 00:28:18,329
I will be there also just to make the introduction.

231
00:28:18,330 --> 00:28:28,990
Then the it will be an informal conversation. You know, you see that you see that building in that in the building?

232
00:28:29,320 --> 00:28:32,820
In the barn? In the basement, you mean. Okay.

233
00:28:34,820 --> 00:28:42,110
If you want a basement, if you're there are some more pieces there, some classroom on one classroom.

234
00:28:44,030 --> 00:28:49,050
I'm used to office. Yes. I.

235
00:28:50,800 --> 00:28:54,130
Then we'll be arguing just an informal conversation.

236
00:28:54,160 --> 00:29:00,940
Please bring your with you along. What you want to know about life in the farming research in the department.

237
00:29:01,270 --> 00:29:05,829
So I'm a buyer. You can ask because I won't be there. I don't want to be there at the beginning.

238
00:29:05,830 --> 00:29:09,970
That'll make that person difference. And again, you can you can ask, okay, how we do that.

239
00:29:10,360 --> 00:29:19,410
But with all like. Well, you can ask questions in front of us.

240
00:29:21,460 --> 00:29:26,350
Okay. Then I will see you next Monday. Are what I have seen.

241
00:29:27,100 --> 00:29:33,330
But how do I check this vehicle that handles that?

242
00:29:38,180 --> 00:29:45,400
And now we are. No.

243
00:29:50,670 --> 00:30:02,960
Okay. I know that. Okay?

244
00:30:03,020 --> 00:30:36,680
Yes. I fell during the study because I just really want.

245
00:30:39,250 --> 00:30:41,320
I need to stop that recording here.
