1
00:00:02,610 --> 00:00:05,860
I did. So I did ask. Welcome back, Ian.

2
00:00:05,880 --> 00:00:14,400
He was on the fast response in Kentucky. So I know you were doing like emergency preparedness stuff per say, but if you can just like, you know,

3
00:00:14,670 --> 00:00:21,329
share a little bit about what you did, did they like give you like a just in time training before he deployed?

4
00:00:21,330 --> 00:00:27,810
Like what was the situation have? So two weeks ago, there was pretty severe flooding in Kentucky.

5
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:32,370
There were, I think it was was less than ten deaths.

6
00:00:32,370 --> 00:00:39,030
But they're still people. That's the way because that a lot of people lost their homes out of fear of damage.

7
00:00:39,750 --> 00:00:50,040
So there was a some of the local health departments, um, contacted the CDC and they set up a caspir,

8
00:00:50,580 --> 00:00:55,500
which was kind of like a survey that we did a really needs assessment sort of survey.

9
00:00:56,280 --> 00:01:03,990
Um, so we decided to show day who's the head of the Public Health Action Support Team.

10
00:01:04,030 --> 00:01:07,979
She organized things while she was on vacation to get everything set up together.

11
00:01:07,980 --> 00:01:14,130
In about four or five days time. We went down to Kentucky.

12
00:01:14,670 --> 00:01:20,940
We had about four or 5 hours of training led by the CDC.

13
00:01:21,090 --> 00:01:28,980
Oh, and then we broke up into small little groups and we went into different areas that were affected by the flood.

14
00:01:29,700 --> 00:01:36,330
Because with somebody from the local health department, we went to a couple different home.

15
00:01:37,850 --> 00:01:43,870
The clusters and that sort of thing. And we interviewed them asking about their experience of the flood.

16
00:01:44,220 --> 00:01:50,100
You know, what messaging did they hear regarding disaster response, if they needed any aid?

17
00:01:50,110 --> 00:01:57,430
And we distributed some aid, but generally speaking, people were doing relatively well.

18
00:01:57,660 --> 00:02:01,020
About two and a half weeks out. Okay.

19
00:02:01,020 --> 00:02:04,800
Do you feel like like just in time training you received was sufficient?

20
00:02:06,430 --> 00:02:10,229
Maybe not. Okay. It was very slow.

21
00:02:10,230 --> 00:02:18,240
The person leaving, it was his first time leading any sort of disaster response or transfer.

22
00:02:20,070 --> 00:02:24,030
And we felt that it was a little bit chaotic.

23
00:02:24,510 --> 00:02:28,470
Okay. I don't know. But doing the things that they used to do.

24
00:02:29,150 --> 00:02:34,290
No, that's fine. Yeah. So it was a little bit haphazard to an extent.

25
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:38,970
Sure. Sure. Are you going to be deployed to Mississippi?

26
00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:44,240
I don't think so. Because fast needed more funds then you find instead.

27
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:50,960
Okay. Okay. Yeah. Thank you for sharing with us a unique life where she you do this.

28
00:02:50,970 --> 00:02:56,070
But I you know, I think your classmates would appreciate the perspective, at least.

29
00:02:57,120 --> 00:03:01,799
I, I definitely haven't heard as much about the flooding in Kentucky as as in Mississippi.

30
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:04,530
But now FEMA is there for the time being.

31
00:03:05,430 --> 00:03:13,050
I wasn't originally going to do this short slide that because this is actually from the online closet that Dr. BIDDINGER was going to cover it.

32
00:03:13,350 --> 00:03:16,860
His lecture was like very comprehensive and jampacked.

33
00:03:17,250 --> 00:03:25,380
Kind of wish he had done some more stories. So we do have a guest lecture this Thursday, but it's only a partial guest lecture.

34
00:03:25,590 --> 00:03:27,080
So we'll show up here in class.

35
00:03:27,090 --> 00:03:35,850
I'll talk for the first half hour and then Commander Liz Garza from the Public Health Service will take over and hopefully it'll be more personal.

36
00:03:35,850 --> 00:03:44,009
But, you know, TBD, but I just wanted to fill in a little bit some more gaps on NDA mess, which is what Dr. BIDDINGER was talking about.

37
00:03:44,010 --> 00:03:51,090
So as he mentioned in his lecture, it was formed in 1984 as part of the Public Health Service,

38
00:03:51,480 --> 00:04:02,969
and it was originally made to essentially support medical care of evacuated military personnel and like civilian civilian casualties overseas.

39
00:04:02,970 --> 00:04:11,850
And then the secondary purpose of it really was to supplement state and local medical forces during disasters and emergencies.

40
00:04:11,850 --> 00:04:18,690
And now we've seen this total transition where the secondary purpose has more or less now become the primary function,

41
00:04:18,690 --> 00:04:24,060
although they do still do the assistance of like military personnel.

42
00:04:24,390 --> 00:04:35,160
So it is a federally coordinated response between the HHS, Homeland Security, the Department of the Defense and the Veterans Affairs Administration.

43
00:04:35,580 --> 00:04:45,630
So after 911 and the EMS expanded to include medical response to terrorist attacks and pre staging for national security events.

44
00:04:45,900 --> 00:04:50,580
So you also now see medical and DMS personnel in there, always in uniform.

45
00:04:50,580 --> 00:04:54,840
So they're wearing like what looks like public health service personnel uniform.

46
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:57,930
They're not military per se, but they are in uniform.

47
00:04:58,170 --> 00:05:04,559
So you'll see them at like the DNC or like the inauguration or like these political events or

48
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:11,340
like larger public events where maybe there's a potential for terrorist attacks or bioterrorism.

49
00:05:12,870 --> 00:05:16,140
So, you know, Dr. BIDDINGER talks about this.

50
00:05:17,370 --> 00:05:22,540
You can see this is kind of like the breakdown. So MDA DMS, they have a number of teams.

51
00:05:22,540 --> 00:05:27,210
So Dr. BIDDINGER is part of a Demat team, which is a disaster medical assistance teams.

52
00:05:27,660 --> 00:05:33,780
So these are, like I mentioned, all people with like regular day jobs who are health care personnel,

53
00:05:34,110 --> 00:05:41,339
from nurses to physicians to respiratory techs, etc., who volunteer.

54
00:05:41,340 --> 00:05:45,690
And when they're deployed, they technically are federal employees at that time.

55
00:05:46,380 --> 00:05:49,320
So they aren't getting paid. They're not doing this for free.

56
00:05:49,650 --> 00:05:56,459
But when you sign up for MDMA, it's kind of like jury duty where it's like your employer has to release you.

57
00:05:56,460 --> 00:06:02,160
You can't, like be fired or penalized for, you know, going to these events.

58
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:06,840
And then also they have to release you when it's time to do like mandatory training.

59
00:06:07,740 --> 00:06:15,870
And then you have medical response teams that are more like EMS personnel, some burn teams, some people who specialize in pediatrics.

60
00:06:16,170 --> 00:06:25,170
There's also veterinary medical assistance teams as well that help with all the animal disaster mortuary operational response teams.

61
00:06:25,170 --> 00:06:28,620
And that's what I've been contracting for since 2018,

62
00:06:28,620 --> 00:06:36,360
because I do a lot of work with people who work with dead bodies and then like joint management and nurse pharmacy response teams.

63
00:06:36,920 --> 00:06:40,370
So generally they're deployed together by area or region.

64
00:06:40,370 --> 00:06:44,629
So I think down your BIDDINGER mentioned he's part of like Massachusetts.

65
00:06:44,630 --> 00:06:51,170
I forget the number but like a state like California has like a ton of teams just because it's very dense and populous.

66
00:06:51,920 --> 00:06:55,790
So you basically become really good friends with your team.

67
00:06:55,790 --> 00:07:00,080
You do local exercises together, you generally deploy together.

68
00:07:02,420 --> 00:07:05,570
And as a team, if it's self, it's been activated.

69
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:09,290
They have to be self sustaining for at least 72 hours.

70
00:07:09,290 --> 00:07:12,410
So you can see here some demat tents set up.

71
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:16,610
And like I said, you have to participate in the exercises as well.

72
00:07:16,610 --> 00:07:20,179
But the sites can vary and it can be extremely limited resource.

73
00:07:20,180 --> 00:07:26,330
So as you mentioned, like that response you had to the Florida Keys where basically everything was just like totally white,

74
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:29,750
they had to be able to sustain themselves for at least 72 hours.

75
00:07:30,050 --> 00:07:33,560
So they are deployed with supplies,

76
00:07:33,560 --> 00:07:44,270
but there is a cache of supplies that's considered like one of the huge storage assets and it's about the size of like a storage container.

77
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:51,380
And they usually deploy those and like really big events, but there's only like three of them in the United States.

78
00:07:51,710 --> 00:07:59,780
So it's not like they can take like this giant storage container and like fly it on a helicopter and like dump it in the middle of Puerto Rico for,

79
00:07:59,780 --> 00:08:05,060
like, hurricane know, for example. Like, logistically, it's it's not that simple.

80
00:08:05,960 --> 00:08:10,880
So so they do evacuate patients to the nearest mobilization center.

81
00:08:10,880 --> 00:08:16,250
So MDA is partnered with local hospitals, like Dr. BIDDINGER mentioned in the Keys,

82
00:08:16,250 --> 00:08:21,020
like the nearest hospital was like inland and like not for like a ways away.

83
00:08:22,010 --> 00:08:27,140
So they'll either like aero medevac people out to the nearest hospital.

84
00:08:27,830 --> 00:08:28,909
If that's not possible,

85
00:08:28,910 --> 00:08:39,740
they'll use ground transport and their main role is just kind of to provide that very cursory care in terms of like patient evaluation,

86
00:08:40,040 --> 00:08:43,790
tracking, admission and discharges. Sorry, that's just a discharges.

87
00:08:44,060 --> 00:08:50,629
And then transport patients back to origin and they do help people with like hospital reimbursement,

88
00:08:50,630 --> 00:08:54,860
as you know, how fragmented the health care system here is in the United States.

89
00:08:55,490 --> 00:09:04,100
This is a look inside of a tent where it's like, you know, they can do things beyond stabilization, but they're not doing like major surgery, right.

90
00:09:04,100 --> 00:09:10,730
Where you can do suturing, you can do triage. And but we're not doing anything like super beyond that without transporting to them hospital.

91
00:09:11,060 --> 00:09:18,410
So during Katrina and Rita and the EMS transported about 3000 patients in New Orleans to

92
00:09:18,410 --> 00:09:23,570
either the nearest military base where they'll set up station or airports to get care.

93
00:09:24,230 --> 00:09:32,719
So they've been deployed since the eighties. So over 300 domestic events and two international incidents you can see here.

94
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:35,959
Beyond that, they also set up a victim information center.

95
00:09:35,960 --> 00:09:39,980
So just say there's matched casualties or like a ton of missing people.

96
00:09:40,310 --> 00:09:47,480
They set up a vehicle essentially so that families can check on like whether or not their loved ones have been identified,

97
00:09:47,480 --> 00:09:53,600
either live with their remains or they might just give some like personal identifiers like this person has,

98
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:59,059
like this kind of tattoo or this kind of piercing, because sometimes in these mass casualty events,

99
00:09:59,060 --> 00:10:02,720
honestly, like they're just collecting like appendages and limbs.

100
00:10:03,650 --> 00:10:11,360
They also support state, local, tribal, territorial response when the resources are overwhelmed.

101
00:10:11,750 --> 00:10:15,240
And then you see here there's a picture of the veterinary response team checking.

102
00:10:15,290 --> 00:10:22,520
I'm like kitty cats, but they also assess environmental and zoonotic diseases that might happen like in a flood, for example.

103
00:10:23,330 --> 00:10:28,280
So many of the capabilities, but all the responses are scaled to the needs of the community.

104
00:10:28,280 --> 00:10:33,349
Heather even said they can't do like major surgeries and things like that,

105
00:10:33,350 --> 00:10:42,290
but do they do basic medical care and do they have like a centralized refrigerating system for prescriptions?

106
00:10:42,290 --> 00:10:45,290
Because a lot of people may not have access to that anymore.

107
00:10:45,290 --> 00:10:50,809
And what if need? Yeah, great question. Yes. So they can do things like suturing, basic stitching.

108
00:10:50,810 --> 00:10:57,050
They can't do like major surgeries that require like in seizures or they're not like performing open heart surgery.

109
00:10:57,350 --> 00:11:02,639
But in their kids, when they deploy, it's like not just like PPE and equipment.

110
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:10,400
And like I read through the list extensively and it's like 50 clipboards, like cameras for documentation, power strips.

111
00:11:10,730 --> 00:11:20,690
So they do have like refrigeration capabilities and they also deploy mobile more because you need somewhere to refrigerate bodies as well.

112
00:11:21,050 --> 00:11:26,340
Yeah. So they can do that. But do, do communities go there until I keep medication cold?

113
00:11:26,570 --> 00:11:29,629
Oh, that's a good question.

114
00:11:29,630 --> 00:11:36,800
I don't know. I don't know of like like a random person, for example, is like I lost my power.

115
00:11:36,930 --> 00:11:40,530
And I need somewhere to, like store breast milk or something, for example.

116
00:11:40,890 --> 00:11:44,820
I don't I don't know if that's within their jurisdiction to do that.

117
00:11:45,720 --> 00:11:52,350
They don't have to. But like sometimes like if they're nice, like they might let you like at a hotel, like, for example,

118
00:11:52,350 --> 00:11:57,239
if you don't have a fridge in there, like you can ask a friend does, like can you keep it in the fridge?

119
00:11:57,240 --> 00:12:01,980
And they sometimes say yes, sometimes they know. But I don't know that specific of details.

120
00:12:02,100 --> 00:12:11,219
That's a good question. I would like to think. Yes. So just some examples of events they've responded to in the past.

121
00:12:11,220 --> 00:12:20,370
Many hurricanes, they responded to the earthquake in Haiti 2010, the Sandy Hook shootings, the H1N1 influenza.

122
00:12:21,060 --> 00:12:27,840
They been at all the presidential State of the Union addresses and then many California wildfires.

123
00:12:29,340 --> 00:12:38,580
So these are just some photos just showing them assisting with like COVID 19 vaccination early when the initial shots were rolled out.

124
00:12:38,610 --> 00:12:44,399
That's them at Hurricane Harvey. But, you know, nobody's perfect, right?

125
00:12:44,400 --> 00:12:50,790
So MDMA certainly has its limitations. So D-Max can take a really long time to deploy.

126
00:12:50,790 --> 00:12:55,229
And they do again have the limited capacity. Right. Because you only can carry so much.

127
00:12:55,230 --> 00:12:59,850
You can only bring so much. And depending on how decimated an area is like,

128
00:12:59,850 --> 00:13:06,840
you might be coming in in a helicopter because the landing strip at the airport no longer exists or it's flooded.

129
00:13:07,620 --> 00:13:14,970
So, for example, one team, Oregon, to deploy to Hurricane Katrina, but it took them four days to get there.

130
00:13:15,630 --> 00:13:20,970
So a lot can happen in four days, right? Imagine if you're like sitting in the roof of your house stranded.

131
00:13:20,970 --> 00:13:26,730
We'll talk more about Katrina later on. Federal medical stations take even longer to deploy.

132
00:13:26,730 --> 00:13:31,320
So these larger units that I'm talking about, and they're limited by equipment and staffing,

133
00:13:31,650 --> 00:13:35,070
they also have limitations on the number of patients that can be transported.

134
00:13:35,520 --> 00:13:41,370
And there's limitations in the health care system because most hospitals in our country are private.

135
00:13:41,700 --> 00:13:44,860
So unless they've opted into partnering with NDA mass,

136
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:50,970
you can't just take them to like the nearest hospital and expect to get treatment, let alone reimbursement.

137
00:13:50,970 --> 00:13:53,730
Right. And the hospitals aren't interconnected.

138
00:13:53,730 --> 00:14:03,180
So like here, for example, in the Ann Arbor area, we now have Michigan Medicine and Trinity Health, formerly Saint Joe's.

139
00:14:03,180 --> 00:14:07,770
They've rebranded. The nice thing is that they use the same charge.

140
00:14:07,800 --> 00:14:12,930
So I see health care providers in both and sometimes the health system talks.

141
00:14:12,930 --> 00:14:16,700
But my main one I go to is Trinity Health right now.

142
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:23,370
This is my fourth state I've lived in. So the Michigan medicine, it looks like I've never had a vaccine in my entire life.

143
00:14:23,370 --> 00:14:28,950
So my portal keeps telling me that I need to get Tdap and like polio and I'm like, I have those.

144
00:14:29,700 --> 00:14:35,520
But you can imagine like how complex again it is because the hospitals aren't interconnected.

145
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:41,040
So that's why you have to go to these hospitals as well to be able to track where the people you brought are.

146
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:45,060
Because just say the hospital discharges them and like you lose a person.

147
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:52,080
And there's also few financial incentives for the private health care systems to be part of DMS.

148
00:14:52,080 --> 00:15:03,330
Right? Money makes the world go round, so they get very few reasons to actually do this like an and it's taking up capacity for paying

149
00:15:03,330 --> 00:15:09,150
patients or like patients they can build like their health insurance for and get that money back.

150
00:15:11,100 --> 00:15:18,540
Okay. So that's what those are just the gaps that I wanted to fill in on in DMS that Dr. BIDDINGER did not

151
00:15:18,540 --> 00:15:25,500
get to because he was doing like a bunch of other stuff but needed any questions about and DMS.

152
00:15:27,380 --> 00:15:34,790
Okay. So let's pick up where we left off last week. And I was doing a case study on the opioid epidemic in the Great Lakes region.

153
00:15:34,790 --> 00:15:39,499
So we talked about how, you know, when people get addicted to prescription opioids,

154
00:15:39,500 --> 00:15:47,659
if they can't access it anymore, they use the closest chemical parallel, which is heroin.

155
00:15:47,660 --> 00:15:53,660
And sometimes people just skip over to heroin versus prescription pain meds now to deal with their pain.

156
00:15:54,380 --> 00:16:00,950
Another one that is of concern is fentanyl. There is legal and illegal fentanyl.

157
00:16:00,950 --> 00:16:05,419
So they will give you this as an anesthetic for basic procedures.

158
00:16:05,420 --> 00:16:09,800
So I have had this given to me before and I'm like outlet that.

159
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:17,240
So if it is pure fat and so you can see here just enough that looks like 5 to 7 grains of salt,

160
00:16:18,140 --> 00:16:22,910
2 to 3 milligrams of this can cause respiratory depression,

161
00:16:22,910 --> 00:16:28,760
arrest and death in a human and like the size of a penny alone, could take down an elephant.

162
00:16:28,760 --> 00:16:33,670
So it acts quickly to depress the central nervous system and respiratory function.

163
00:16:34,610 --> 00:16:39,410
There is a lot of fentanyl circulating here in the United States, but it's impure.

164
00:16:39,740 --> 00:16:47,510
So it's cut with a lot of different drugs and synthetics and sometimes like baby powder or baby formula to make,

165
00:16:47,510 --> 00:16:56,180
you know, like the weight more so the dealers or whomever are getting like more return on their investment, so to speak.

166
00:16:56,570 --> 00:17:03,709
But we are concerned about people who handle this, like fentanyl is widely circulating in the mail and people don't know it in mail.

167
00:17:03,710 --> 00:17:12,470
Carriers have to handle it. Are like we've had emergency response personnel accidentally come into contact with it and be exposed and like pass out.

168
00:17:13,610 --> 00:17:19,610
So in the realm of infectious diseases, in terms of opioid waste and drug paraphernalia.

169
00:17:19,940 --> 00:17:27,140
So, you know, I happened to be working in Indiana at the time when there was the growing opioid crisis,

170
00:17:27,950 --> 00:17:32,120
and this was paralleled with an infectious disease crisis.

171
00:17:32,120 --> 00:17:41,000
So back in 2016, we had, you know, a drug using population that also was very transient.

172
00:17:41,450 --> 00:17:48,590
And because of Indiana's public health policies, there was no safe needle exchange program.

173
00:17:48,920 --> 00:17:51,410
And these are people without health care and resources.

174
00:17:51,740 --> 00:18:01,490
So you have people who are, you know, using drugs intravenously, not necessarily knowing their health status, not necessarily getting health care.

175
00:18:01,820 --> 00:18:11,150
And some did indeed have HIV, but they were moving between like the Kentucky, Indiana, Ohio border.

176
00:18:11,930 --> 00:18:22,580
And so in this county, you know, sparked an HIV outbreak and then it led to a larger outbreak and then hep C as well.

177
00:18:22,850 --> 00:18:26,600
And at that time, who remembers who the governor of Indiana was?

178
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:32,899
Mike Pence. Mike Pence. Mike Pence.

179
00:18:32,900 --> 00:18:42,229
Yep. Uh huh. So at the time, Mike Pence was the governor and he said absolutely no to needle exchange programs.

180
00:18:42,230 --> 00:18:46,310
So they had it for like a hot second and did away with it.

181
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:55,550
So that kind of proliferated the spread of infectious diseases because the thing with people who are going to use drugs there,

182
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:59,120
they have an addiction that needs to be treated right.

183
00:18:59,120 --> 00:19:09,649
So if they're going to use, they're going to use, but at least provide them the safe resources to do so rather than and who.

184
00:19:09,650 --> 00:19:18,980
But okay, so that cascaded and then they turned out to be like a huge hep a hep C outbreak that was in Kentucky.

185
00:19:19,010 --> 00:19:26,270
Louisville specifically usually have a is fecal oral and you get it from like food borne illnesses.

186
00:19:26,270 --> 00:19:30,980
But again, this was proliferated by the drug use.

187
00:19:32,060 --> 00:19:42,950
So in 2018, if you look at opioid involved, overdose deaths per 100,000 people with the shading, the gray states obviously don't provide data.

188
00:19:42,950 --> 00:19:50,450
But if we look in like the greater the Great Lakes region, Kentucky is not considered part of that.

189
00:19:50,810 --> 00:19:56,180
But Ohio was definitely one of the states that was hit the hardest.

190
00:19:57,260 --> 00:20:01,210
So just a quick recap on hep C or HCV.

191
00:20:01,550 --> 00:20:08,840
So this is a blood borne virus that infects the liver and there's seven genotypes of the virus and 67 subtypes.

192
00:20:08,840 --> 00:20:16,640
So a ton, a ton of time. So this can gradually lead to cirrhosis, which is like scarring of your liver tissue,

193
00:20:16,970 --> 00:20:23,810
and then it can lead to liver cancer, specifically hepatic cell carcinoma if untreated.

194
00:20:24,200 --> 00:20:28,520
But with hep C, symptoms can take decades to manifest.

195
00:20:28,550 --> 00:20:32,330
So this is shared through, you know, spreading needles primarily.

196
00:20:34,130 --> 00:20:41,240
The thing, though, is that because of the way the virus works and again, I'm not a virologist, so we're not going to get into this on this course.

197
00:20:41,720 --> 00:20:44,750
But just say you have an accidental needle stick, right?

198
00:20:44,750 --> 00:20:55,220
And now you're concerned you may have been exposed to some form of hepatitis or HIV because it takes a while for it to show up in your system.

199
00:20:55,520 --> 00:21:03,920
You could be waiting anywhere between 4 to 8 weeks to get a test that can definitively rule in or rule out whether or not you got it.

200
00:21:04,310 --> 00:21:10,160
This is also a test they don't screen for regularly in your normal health care blood panel.

201
00:21:10,160 --> 00:21:21,290
So you have to ask specifically for it. And the Bloodborne Pathogens Standard from OSHA really only covers prophylaxis for have HIV and Hepatitis B,

202
00:21:21,770 --> 00:21:25,549
hepatitis C currently doesn't have a vaccine for it.

203
00:21:25,550 --> 00:21:29,630
So there's have a there's have be you get three shots for each.

204
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:38,390
I had to get them like in elementary school because in California to go to middle school, you had to have hepatitis vaccine.

205
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:42,860
But I found out that's not the case everywhere. Interestingly.

206
00:21:43,250 --> 00:21:54,049
Yeah, so there are approximately two and a half people in the U.S. right now living with hep C so we can see the Hep C and opioid co-infections.

207
00:21:54,050 --> 00:22:04,940
So during this time frame of this decade, Hep C among those 18 to 29 increased by 400%,

208
00:22:05,270 --> 00:22:14,540
and admission for opioid injection increased by 622% for those 30 to 39 and increased by 325%.

209
00:22:15,860 --> 00:22:25,480
So Ohio in particular has rising rates of Hep C lately is connected to the use of opioids in the state?

210
00:22:25,490 --> 00:22:30,140
So you can see in 2014 we had 12,000 cases.

211
00:22:30,500 --> 00:22:38,150
Then in 2015, about 15,000, 2016, it bumped up to 20,017.

212
00:22:38,630 --> 00:22:41,930
Kind of went down a little bit. 18. It kind of went down a little bit.

213
00:22:42,620 --> 00:22:47,780
And then 19 an opioid. Eric Kolb It happened and then, you know, it went up.

214
00:22:48,140 --> 00:22:57,110
So epidemiologists did manage to link this to I.V. drug use, particularly in the southern Appalachian counties of Ohio.

215
00:22:57,110 --> 00:23:03,620
But there was also a have a outbreak from 2019 and 2021 linked to drug use and

216
00:23:03,620 --> 00:23:10,160
poor sanitation among the population for people experiencing housing instability.

217
00:23:10,670 --> 00:23:15,590
So you can see the darker counties are the ones that are most affected.

218
00:23:15,590 --> 00:23:21,320
But the response was largely left up to the counties the state didn't like.

219
00:23:21,860 --> 00:23:32,570
Super do a lot to intervene, so they did allow some syringe exchange services since 2016 in these most affected counties.

220
00:23:32,840 --> 00:23:36,770
They did some screening for HIV and Hep C wound care.

221
00:23:36,770 --> 00:23:40,940
They did some fentanyl testing strips which you can provide to people,

222
00:23:41,720 --> 00:23:48,770
and then naloxone and the locks on training for overdose, reversal and connections to programs and services.

223
00:23:49,130 --> 00:23:59,540
And Ohio Medicaid did change its policy to allow for Hep C treatment, but the response was mostly focused on tertiary care.

224
00:23:59,540 --> 00:24:06,140
Right? So like just trying to put out the fire, but not really addressing the source of the problem.

225
00:24:06,950 --> 00:24:13,549
And there is a medication for hepatitis C, it's you might see commercials for it sometimes,

226
00:24:13,550 --> 00:24:17,120
like those pharmaceutical commercials, it's called Sovaldi.

227
00:24:17,690 --> 00:24:23,690
Guess how much one pill cost without insurance. There are some numbers.

228
00:24:25,620 --> 00:24:29,400
A couple hundred to $200 a pill. A grand.

229
00:24:29,790 --> 00:24:41,849
A thousand? Yeah. Yeah. So imagine, you know, if you're a person, low income or, like, virtually no income and you have hepatitis C,

230
00:24:41,850 --> 00:24:47,250
like, a lot of people don't have an option, but just to kind of like let it ride.

231
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:52,800
And then oftentimes you have folks with like concurrent addictions as well.

232
00:24:52,800 --> 00:25:03,630
So they might also be consuming alcohol, which how the alcohol use escalates, the cirrhosis of the liver and bringing you closer to end stage liver.

233
00:25:03,930 --> 00:25:09,480
And the liver is like amazing. It's like the number one detox here in your body.

234
00:25:10,230 --> 00:25:13,740
It does so much work, I'm sure. Did you talk about this in toxicology?

235
00:25:14,220 --> 00:25:22,410
Yeah. So, like, if I were to get in a car accident and like my seatbelt, like, sliced off a chunk of my liver, you know, for some reason,

236
00:25:22,410 --> 00:25:31,140
God forbid, you know, get surgery, the liver, that chunk of the liver could regenerate itself in like 2 to 3 months.

237
00:25:31,590 --> 00:25:37,200
And I don't really drink that much. I mean, I, I eat a lot of, like, chocolate, but like, I'm not doing a lot of other harmful things.

238
00:25:37,410 --> 00:25:39,000
So the liver is incredible.

239
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:46,470
But once you get rid of like the main detoxification system in your body, it just everything else starts to dramatically fail.

240
00:25:47,790 --> 00:25:52,680
Okay. Yes. Burn test strips are those like you see how pure it is like.

241
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:59,819
Yeah. So you, you know, like strips that you use like an undergrad chem lab where it's like, oh, this is basic or whatever.

242
00:25:59,820 --> 00:26:05,879
It's the same thing where you you can, number one, those test strips just tell you,

243
00:26:05,880 --> 00:26:12,540
is there fentanyl prisoners just a solid like random white powder and then like how potent it potentially is.

244
00:26:12,810 --> 00:26:16,830
But it's, you know, what we call an I age, like a direct weed instrument.

245
00:26:16,830 --> 00:26:20,790
So it's not super duper accurate, but it at least you know.

246
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:29,010
Hello, is it there or not? Yeah. Yeah. And a lot of like organizations will provide these testing strips for free.

247
00:26:29,010 --> 00:26:35,309
So I was recently at a workshop in DC hosted by the Center for Construction Research, which is, you know, niet.

248
00:26:35,310 --> 00:26:36,900
And the topic was opioids.

249
00:26:37,500 --> 00:26:45,750
And like one of the community based organizations brought just like a bunch of like animal testing strips that I only had a carry on,

250
00:26:45,750 --> 00:26:50,659
so I didn't want to take any back. Yeah, sure. Because that would have been cool to show you.

251
00:26:50,660 --> 00:26:59,910
Well, next time. Next time. So I'm going to see what Dr. BIDDINGER didn't cover and then and fill in the gaps.

252
00:26:59,910 --> 00:27:03,390
So, yeah, he talked about all this.

253
00:27:04,110 --> 00:27:08,439
This is. A chart of things that he said.

254
00:27:08,440 --> 00:27:15,909
If you're a more visual person, the ones in the in the shaded are the ones that we'll focus on like a little bit more in this class and

255
00:27:15,910 --> 00:27:24,190
are more involved in the infectious disease response under DHS and the National Institutes of Health.

256
00:27:24,550 --> 00:27:29,500
You know, some of the big biggest players are National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases,

257
00:27:29,500 --> 00:27:34,840
or Dr. Fauci was now retiring National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences.

258
00:27:35,230 --> 00:27:42,610
Now, Ash isn't under here because they're technically under the CDC, which is a little bit complicated.

259
00:27:44,110 --> 00:27:48,459
So under DHHS is the CDC. So here is the org chart for the CDC.

260
00:27:48,460 --> 00:27:53,650
So you have NAIA, you have the Public Health Service and implementation science.

261
00:27:53,650 --> 00:27:58,750
And what that's where you have like Global Health Center for Preparedness and Response, Minority Health and Equity.

262
00:27:58,750 --> 00:28:04,750
Then you have people who do surveillance, you have people who do chronic diseases like diabetes and stuff.

263
00:28:04,750 --> 00:28:06,880
And then you have an infectious disease area.

264
00:28:07,120 --> 00:28:13,390
You have the office of the director, chief medical officer, a bunch of these blah, blah, blah bureaucratic titles.

265
00:28:14,770 --> 00:28:23,140
So in particular, so he talks a little bit about DHS and DHS, our DHS,

266
00:28:23,350 --> 00:28:27,969
and how historically they not have they have not been like their main role is not to do

267
00:28:27,970 --> 00:28:31,810
emergency response and their main role is not to do an infectious disease response,

268
00:28:32,110 --> 00:28:35,469
but because of the way like our world is now.

269
00:28:35,470 --> 00:28:39,940
And so many of these, like the Venn diagram just like overlaps constantly.

270
00:28:40,750 --> 00:28:44,500
They have become involved, for better or for worse.

271
00:28:44,500 --> 00:28:49,209
So U.S. Customs and Border Protection, you know, when you clear customs, like,

272
00:28:49,210 --> 00:28:55,090
you're not allowed to bring like a pineapple along with you from like Malaysia or something like that, right?

273
00:28:55,090 --> 00:28:59,799
Because they don't want you introducing like foreign species of plants.

274
00:28:59,800 --> 00:29:07,090
Same thing with various meats. You have U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, Coast Guard, FEMA,

275
00:29:07,270 --> 00:29:14,500
Customs and informant enforcement, secret service and the tsa is under there as well.

276
00:29:14,650 --> 00:29:18,970
Hoda just randomly said that my family and i were going to canada.

277
00:29:18,980 --> 00:29:24,700
We had fresh tomatoes and the border patrol person for the of signs like you can

278
00:29:24,700 --> 00:29:29,620
take this to Canada but you can't bring us back to the U.S. with us for that.

279
00:29:30,190 --> 00:29:35,110
There's no way of proving that. Interesting tomatoes.

280
00:29:36,460 --> 00:29:42,220
I was really bummed. TSA made me throw away Nutella from Germany.

281
00:29:42,220 --> 00:29:45,640
It tastes different. Okay. My mom's family lives there. It is different.

282
00:29:46,240 --> 00:29:50,830
And they were like, this is technically considered a jail. And I was like, I hate you.

283
00:29:51,130 --> 00:29:55,900
My sister did manage to bring back GM from the U.K. because she's a lawyer.

284
00:29:55,900 --> 00:29:59,590
So she like argued with TSA to like do that.

285
00:29:59,590 --> 00:30:04,120
But like, I mean, some things are benign, but then some things like people don't know.

286
00:30:04,120 --> 00:30:11,740
So I used to watch this show that was about so like certain countries are more strict about these things like Australia,

287
00:30:11,770 --> 00:30:17,229
Australia, the United Kingdom. So the show that I watched was about Heathrow Airport in particular,

288
00:30:17,230 --> 00:30:24,549
and like screening animals that come in and out of the U.K. So like, if you bring your dog to the U.K.,

289
00:30:24,550 --> 00:30:27,459
your dog will be held for like 4 to 6 weeks,

290
00:30:27,460 --> 00:30:35,470
like in a kennel at a supervising place that your dog's and she's pregnant parvo while over like, you know, Manchester or whatever.

291
00:30:35,470 --> 00:30:41,650
But some people do wild stuff. Like there was this man who snuck in like a bunch of baby turtles in his pants.

292
00:30:42,400 --> 00:30:46,389
People do wild things, but sometimes important.

293
00:30:46,390 --> 00:30:50,280
But you know what? My Nutella was not a security threat because of that.

294
00:30:51,970 --> 00:30:59,230
So other agencies that you know, Dr. BIDDINGER, he talked a little bit about FDA and D.O.D.,

295
00:30:59,260 --> 00:31:04,419
but the USDA like, you know, with your tomatoes, that was definitely USDA.

296
00:31:04,420 --> 00:31:08,530
When I came back from Puerto Rico, even though it is a United States territory,

297
00:31:08,830 --> 00:31:16,930
my luggage had to go through an additional FDA scan to make sure I wasn't bringing any food or whatever back into the mainland.

298
00:31:16,930 --> 00:31:20,740
And then we also have a national vaccine program office.

299
00:31:21,730 --> 00:31:28,720
I do want to highlight, though, some nonprofit and community orgs that do provide aid, emergency response.

300
00:31:29,500 --> 00:31:38,020
So in addition to like Steve going forward, so you know what that means now, you know, this can be their response is not mandatory,

301
00:31:38,020 --> 00:31:44,590
but they have the community in which their organizations reside and obviously they're better attuned to the needs of the communities.

302
00:31:44,950 --> 00:31:52,480
So this could be as little as like handing out water bottles and supplies at the local churches rather than at the local health department.

303
00:31:52,750 --> 00:31:56,799
They sometimes do this for vaccine deployment as well because they know certain communities.

304
00:31:56,800 --> 00:31:59,110
They're not going to come to the local health department,

305
00:31:59,320 --> 00:32:05,410
but they may come to the local library or the local church or like providing vaccines at a drive through clinic.

306
00:32:05,590 --> 00:32:09,910
Wal-Mart, for example, or Myer rather than the hospital.

307
00:32:10,950 --> 00:32:15,690
So like I said, you know, you have local like faith based institutions.

308
00:32:15,990 --> 00:32:23,940
National Suicide Prevention Lifeline, but also local behavioral health resources, food banks, community kitchens, community center,

309
00:32:24,240 --> 00:32:32,610
health corps, AmeriCorps, environmental groups, and so much more that provide a lot of mutual aid to fill in the gaps.

310
00:32:33,960 --> 00:32:36,870
A spotlight on the Red Cross. Red Crescent.

311
00:32:37,350 --> 00:32:44,520
I do acknowledge they have like a lot of their own issues, which we can well, we can talk about in future lectures.

312
00:32:44,520 --> 00:32:49,799
But they were formally founded not until 1919, which seems like kind of late.

313
00:32:49,800 --> 00:32:51,540
Right. Because I feel like they're around before that.

314
00:32:52,170 --> 00:32:59,459
They are known as the Red Crescent in different parts of the world, but they are considered humanitarian with over 97 million volunteers.

315
00:32:59,460 --> 00:33:07,770
And they've coordinated for like various events like measles eradication, Ebola testing,

316
00:33:07,770 --> 00:33:14,850
donors for convalescent plasma during COVID, and then the National Foundation for Infectious Diseases.

317
00:33:15,630 --> 00:33:24,210
They partnered with like CDC and they BARDA that Dr. BIDDINGER mentioned to create resources for the public.

318
00:33:24,750 --> 00:33:30,690
Factsheets, infographics, information on vaccine safety and vaccine science.

319
00:33:32,070 --> 00:33:37,920
I don't know how much marketing they actually do, but they probably need to ramp up on that.

320
00:33:39,420 --> 00:33:44,940
Okay, so that's all we had for that one. Questions or comments?

321
00:33:46,920 --> 00:33:50,160
Slight of hand, Lexi. Yeah, I think so.

322
00:33:50,460 --> 00:33:54,750
Okay. Right. That's right. Mm hmm.

323
00:33:55,430 --> 00:34:01,300
Um. So that was like when it was officially banned.

324
00:34:01,540 --> 00:34:07,270
Yeah. Okay. Because, I don't know. Growing up, I always learned about the great fire of 1881.

325
00:34:07,300 --> 00:34:12,040
Yeah. Yeah. And how the Red Cross provided relief back then.

326
00:34:12,400 --> 00:34:18,460
They were I think the 1919 was when they officially established, like themselves as a nonprofit organization.

327
00:34:18,490 --> 00:34:23,770
Okay. In terms of like legalese. I have another letter with Red Cross in it.

328
00:34:24,060 --> 00:34:30,250
Okay. Maybe today. I scanned what I was talking about very briefly, but.

329
00:34:30,250 --> 00:34:33,580
Yes, thank you. Good question. Yes.

330
00:34:34,260 --> 00:34:37,810
Hmm. Okey dokey.

331
00:34:38,860 --> 00:34:47,980
So we're going to start talking about racism and xenophobia, and then we'll talk about, like, a little history thing.

332
00:34:48,190 --> 00:34:53,650
How many of you took that class with John Zellner? That was like a history class of infectious diseases.

333
00:34:54,520 --> 00:34:58,149
Now it's offered at the undergrad level, at the 400 level.

334
00:34:58,150 --> 00:35:01,540
I don't know if any of you were undergrads here. No. Okay.

335
00:35:01,870 --> 00:35:04,930
I heard it was cool. Okay.

336
00:35:05,170 --> 00:35:07,479
He met up with me. He was like, all right, I didn't teach in this class.

337
00:35:07,480 --> 00:35:11,200
And I was like, oh, my gosh, are we like doing like some territory beef or something like that?

338
00:35:11,200 --> 00:35:15,410
But he was really cool. He was really cool about it and is very nice.

339
00:35:15,430 --> 00:35:27,310
So no worries there. Okay. So naming conventions for infectious diseases and outbreaks, so recently the World Health Organization,

340
00:35:28,150 --> 00:35:31,510
who is also a flawed organization and we will talk about that as well,

341
00:35:31,810 --> 00:35:38,710
has issued a statement due to the number of serious infections that have emerged and reemerged over the decades.

342
00:35:39,160 --> 00:35:43,330
So focus specifically on human infectious diseases.

343
00:35:43,330 --> 00:35:53,920
So nothing that particularly pertains to animals and zoonoses like equine encephalitis or like parvo or, you know, distemper.

344
00:35:54,130 --> 00:36:00,790
Right. So we're talking about things like swine flu, bird flu, Middle East Respiratory Syndrome.

345
00:36:01,120 --> 00:36:05,080
And essentially when these things are named in such a manner,

346
00:36:05,410 --> 00:36:13,030
they can have unintended impacts like stigma on certain communities, or it can impact economic sectors.

347
00:36:13,480 --> 00:36:18,850
But, you know, this isn't meant to replace the International Classification Diseases System.

348
00:36:19,150 --> 00:36:27,160
So the ICD is mostly what physicians use. So if you ever look at a medical bill and you'll see like ICD, like a bunch of digits or whatever,

349
00:36:27,160 --> 00:36:31,510
like that's the way they code what the your differential diagnosis was.

350
00:36:31,510 --> 00:36:40,360
So this isn't a replacement for this, but it's mostly like best practices for when it is referred to by the general public in the media.

351
00:36:40,810 --> 00:36:48,250
Okay. So Dr. FOUKARA, who was the assistant director for general health security of the W.H.O.,

352
00:36:48,250 --> 00:36:57,489
said this may seem like a trivial issue to some, but disease names really do matter to people who are directly affected.

353
00:36:57,490 --> 00:37:04,660
We've seen certain disease named provoke a backlash against certain members of particular religious or ethnic communities.

354
00:37:05,050 --> 00:37:13,090
It creates unjustified barriers to travel, commerce and trade and triggers needless slaughtering of food animals.

355
00:37:13,480 --> 00:37:17,740
This can have serious consequences for people's lives and livelihoods.

356
00:37:18,280 --> 00:37:26,919
So back when there was a big like avian influenza scare, when they were like, oh my gosh, this is the next pandemic of 1918.

357
00:37:26,920 --> 00:37:30,070
I remember, I forget it was when I was living in Nebraska.

358
00:37:30,370 --> 00:37:37,870
They called over a million turkeys in Iowa just because there was a small like avian influenza outbreak.

359
00:37:37,870 --> 00:37:41,710
But they were so worried about the public perception of it all.

360
00:37:42,010 --> 00:37:46,690
So that year, like turkeys for Thanksgiving, were like a little bit more expensive.

361
00:37:46,690 --> 00:37:53,469
But like, you know, when they see like needless slaughter of food animals, whereas like animals that may not directly be affected,

362
00:37:53,470 --> 00:37:58,180
but because of the perception of the name, like they feel like they have to do this.

363
00:37:59,410 --> 00:38:05,410
So the best practices is to go first for like a general descriptive term.

364
00:38:05,770 --> 00:38:09,129
So what is the symptoms that cause the disease?

365
00:38:09,130 --> 00:38:12,910
First, this is a respiratory disease and a logical waterborne.

366
00:38:12,910 --> 00:38:13,810
What causes it?

367
00:38:14,320 --> 00:38:23,450
And then if you want to get like a little bit more jazzy, you can add a more descriptive term, like, is it progressive, juvenile, is it severe?

368
00:38:23,470 --> 00:38:30,520
Does it only occur in the winter? And if the pathogen is known, should it be part of the disease name?

369
00:38:30,520 --> 00:38:41,649
So, you know, SARS-CoV-2 is called such because it's caused by Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome, part of the Corona virus.

370
00:38:41,650 --> 00:38:48,340
Family number two, because SARS-COV-1 was 2000 to 2003.

371
00:38:48,670 --> 00:38:58,240
And then the disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 was then called COVID 19 because they discovered it in 2019.

372
00:38:58,690 --> 00:39:06,729
But there was a lot of heavy debate about what it should be called avoid things like geographic regions,

373
00:39:06,730 --> 00:39:11,740
Spanish flu, for example, 1918, influenza, Rift Valley fever.

374
00:39:11,740 --> 00:39:15,430
There is actually a Rift Valley. Avoid people's names.

375
00:39:15,730 --> 00:39:22,120
Sometimes people like to name the disease after the person who discovered it.

376
00:39:22,510 --> 00:39:26,469
So it does happen, right? I think it's a unique choice.

377
00:39:26,470 --> 00:39:30,940
Maybe don't think about it down the line, but you want to try to avoid people's names like Croods Felt.

378
00:39:30,940 --> 00:39:34,210
Jakob Disease is a prion or Chagas disease.

379
00:39:34,660 --> 00:39:39,069
You want to avoid species of animals or food like monkeypox in particular.

380
00:39:39,070 --> 00:39:43,090
Not a great name for what's happening right now. Bird flu.

381
00:39:43,720 --> 00:39:51,460
You also want to avoid cultural populations, industries or occupational references like coal miners, disease, coal miners, lungs.

382
00:39:52,930 --> 00:39:58,659
You know, it does maybe dissuade people from entering into that occupation,

383
00:39:58,660 --> 00:40:03,879
although the number of people mining these days is severely decreased, but still.

384
00:40:03,880 --> 00:40:16,820
And. And avoid terms that incite undue fear, an unknown, fatal epidemic so poor naming conventions can indeed exacerbate racism.

385
00:40:16,850 --> 00:40:25,459
I'm going to focus on COVID. Okay. So I grew up in California, so like in fourth grade is state history.

386
00:40:25,460 --> 00:40:33,140
So we talked all about the Chinese Exclusion Act, Angel Island, Japanese internment camps.

387
00:40:33,220 --> 00:40:41,910
Like a lot of AAPI history. And it was just wild to me that a bunch of peop states don't even cover this.

388
00:40:41,910 --> 00:40:47,840
Still, like people thought, COVID was the first time Asian people had experienced racism.

389
00:40:48,350 --> 00:40:52,310
King is smiling and smiling. It is so funny.

390
00:40:52,730 --> 00:40:58,700
But like, you know, poor naming conventions can focus on particular worlds or countries or regions and

391
00:40:58,700 --> 00:41:05,089
can intentionally or unintentionally cause associations of people or a place being,

392
00:41:05,090 --> 00:41:08,720
you know, perceived as unclean, unhygienic or disease.

393
00:41:09,050 --> 00:41:17,990
So this is a like poster in particular, where this is like proclamation of the Chinese Exclusion Act.

394
00:41:18,320 --> 00:41:23,840
The Chinese must go. We have no use for them since we got this wonderful washer.

395
00:41:23,840 --> 00:41:28,399
What a blessing to tired mothers. It costs so little and don't injure the clothes.

396
00:41:28,400 --> 00:41:37,970
So, you know, a lot of Chinese immigrants came over in particular to California in the 1800s to not only work in like the gold and mining,

397
00:41:38,300 --> 00:41:46,430
but they were a huge part of building like the Trans Union Railroad that now runs across the United States.

398
00:41:46,760 --> 00:41:54,200
But they were perceived as taking jobs away from like Irish immigrants or like other European immigrants.

399
00:41:54,440 --> 00:42:02,300
And there was this stigma that, yeah, they were clean and unhygienic and disease because like they ate different things in their diet.

400
00:42:03,020 --> 00:42:06,589
We still like see that kind of stigma here today.

401
00:42:06,590 --> 00:42:14,749
I mean, obviously we know like things with like, you know, that do carry that are reservoirs for diseases like pangolins for example.

402
00:42:14,750 --> 00:42:21,050
But like, oh, like look at these Chinese people. Like they eat bats or like they eat chicken feed.

403
00:42:21,800 --> 00:42:29,300
I have had many like jokes in my life where like and feel free if you want to speak to this came but I won't force you.

404
00:42:29,300 --> 00:42:35,330
I'll speak to my own response where like people ask me like do eat dog like these kinds of things and you think like,

405
00:42:35,330 --> 00:42:38,750
you know, like people think these, you know, things are pretty harmless.

406
00:42:38,750 --> 00:42:46,010
But this is all part of like the, the, the bias or like essentially like the racist stereotypes that go into it.

407
00:42:46,820 --> 00:42:57,650
And so like with the Chinese Exclusion Act, that was the largest exclusion of any ethnic group coming to the United States in United States history.

408
00:42:58,040 --> 00:43:05,450
Angel Island was like kind of like a purgatory camp where a lot of them were in prison.

409
00:43:06,320 --> 00:43:15,170
So and then they talked about yellow fever, which they, you know, described Asian people being yellow and fever being like diseases they carry.

410
00:43:15,170 --> 00:43:22,459
So this has been going on for this is not new. This has been going on for like a good century plus.

411
00:43:22,460 --> 00:43:35,120
Right. So again, here I talked about the origins of where COVID came from, but in the media, we've heard it called the Wuhan virus.

412
00:43:35,120 --> 00:43:46,400
Right. Because the virus was first discovered in Wuhan, China, Chinese virus, China virus, kung flu, various spins and takes on this.

413
00:43:47,300 --> 00:43:58,250
And what this resulted in was an uptick in anti-Asian hate crimes, not only violence, but also threats and biases in person.

414
00:43:58,250 --> 00:44:03,110
So President Trump did, you know, call it kung flu to pander to his base.

415
00:44:03,890 --> 00:44:10,370
And people said, okay, you can't call it Wuhan or China virus because it's inaccurate and also xenophobic.

416
00:44:10,700 --> 00:44:18,080
But they found, you know, a lot of these people who do like social media, spatial analysis,

417
00:44:19,100 --> 00:44:23,540
but these times were just widely circulating on like Twitter or Facebook.

418
00:44:24,950 --> 00:44:32,749
So, you know, the saddest thing, though, is between March 2020 and May 2021,

419
00:44:32,750 --> 00:44:37,460
the number of hate crimes against Asian and Asian Americans increased by 150%.

420
00:44:37,820 --> 00:44:40,969
And this is likely an underreporting because, you know,

421
00:44:40,970 --> 00:44:47,299
like the way Asian culture is in particular, it's usually very much like just take it on the chin.

422
00:44:47,300 --> 00:44:50,390
Like be happy to be here, just take it on the chin.

423
00:44:50,390 --> 00:44:55,940
So if something happens to you, like you don't necessarily need to say anything about it.

424
00:44:55,940 --> 00:45:00,139
But there is also this distrust of authorities like the police.

425
00:45:00,140 --> 00:45:03,770
Right. With a lot of minority communities. So it wasn't reported.

426
00:45:04,060 --> 00:45:11,320
But the thing that was like the most I would say sickening to me is that they were mostly targeting women and elderly women,

427
00:45:11,320 --> 00:45:15,820
in particular in populations like cities like San Francisco,

428
00:45:15,820 --> 00:45:24,010
New York City, where there's always been a huge presence of Asian Americans that you like think they've been living in harmony.

429
00:45:24,010 --> 00:45:29,650
But now all of a sudden, you know, the xenophobia and racism comes out because of COVID.

430
00:45:30,520 --> 00:45:34,060
And even though there's like dozens of Asian ethnicities.

431
00:45:34,510 --> 00:45:40,030
Like to the average racist person, like they'll look at me and be like, you're Chinese, right?

432
00:45:40,030 --> 00:45:43,290
It doesn't matter, like what ethnicity you are.

433
00:45:43,300 --> 00:45:46,690
And like I said, there's likely an underreporting.

434
00:45:47,680 --> 00:45:52,720
And so Congress did pass the COVID 19 Hate Crimes Act in April 2021.

435
00:45:53,050 --> 00:45:56,200
I don't think this honestly did anything.

436
00:45:56,830 --> 00:46:00,700
So in communities like Oakland, California, San Francisco,

437
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:06,610
a lot of communities banded together and kind of created like their own neighborhood policing.

438
00:46:08,050 --> 00:46:15,490
So I'm just going to get into some social, social stuff now just because, you know,

439
00:46:15,580 --> 00:46:19,750
to walk elderly people from place to place to make sure like they weren't attacked.

440
00:46:19,750 --> 00:46:24,760
Like in Yonkers, New York, there's like old Asian lady who walked into, like, you know,

441
00:46:24,760 --> 00:46:29,860
how banks have like two doors where, like the first door you can withdraw cash like 24, seven.

442
00:46:29,860 --> 00:46:36,189
And the second was actually the bank. She went in to withdraw cash in the evening and some dude just like who's like three

443
00:46:36,190 --> 00:46:41,020
times their size came in and like punched her like in her head like 124 times.

444
00:46:41,320 --> 00:46:46,000
Or like sometimes you'll get really scrappy elderly Asian people who like

445
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:49,720
fight back after they were like stabbed or like hit in the head with a brick.

446
00:46:50,080 --> 00:46:54,730
Or like in New York, like a lot of people were like spit on or like throwing things at.

447
00:46:54,970 --> 00:46:58,720
And I got really concerned because my sister lives in New York City.

448
00:46:59,200 --> 00:47:02,829
She works for this mayor. She's a lawyer.

449
00:47:02,830 --> 00:47:05,200
She's legal counsel. Right. But like, you know,

450
00:47:05,200 --> 00:47:12,339
they were recently just like pushing like Asian women into subway tracks or like following them home and then like stabbing them to death.

451
00:47:12,340 --> 00:47:18,220
That happened in Chinatown. Or like my mom who lives by herself in Sacramento.

452
00:47:18,520 --> 00:47:27,309
She is very scrappy. So she is the kind of person who would like fight back and yell and chase on down the street, but like why?

453
00:47:27,310 --> 00:47:33,550
And it's just out of honestly, like a lot of ignorance and a lot of this like incorrect terminology.

454
00:47:33,880 --> 00:47:43,270
Again, ascribing like Asian people to being like disease vectors, essentially being dirty because of like our cultural practices or our diet.

455
00:47:44,890 --> 00:47:51,520
Whereas like some people here in parts of the country, you know, possum and I'm sure some people think that's weird,

456
00:47:51,520 --> 00:47:55,599
but it's like, okay, it's not really your job to put a value judgment on that.

457
00:47:55,600 --> 00:48:03,430
So like here's some associated news clips. So two Asian women repeatedly attacked with a cinderblock at a Baltimore store.

458
00:48:03,790 --> 00:48:12,609
Asian woman hit with a hammer by a stranger in Alhambra to Michigan, anti-Asian racism and attacks.

459
00:48:12,610 --> 00:48:17,550
And then a man arrested in San Francisco for stabbing two Asian women.

460
00:48:18,310 --> 00:48:22,660
The complex thing about this is, though, like the Pew did, I had to have this study.

461
00:48:23,110 --> 00:48:30,849
Oh, okay. The Pew Center of River Research took a survey of minorities during the summer of 2020.

462
00:48:30,850 --> 00:48:39,309
So that's when, like the George Floyd protests were going on. And also all of this anti-Asian hate and the black community actually said, like,

463
00:48:39,310 --> 00:48:46,750
they had white people coming up to them and expressing their allies [INAUDIBLE], but Asian people did not.

464
00:48:47,350 --> 00:48:52,959
And it's interesting, like these interesting dynamics of here in the United States where, you know,

465
00:48:52,960 --> 00:48:59,410
Asian people are considered like the model minority, which is a term made up by white folk.

466
00:48:59,410 --> 00:49:04,690
Right. In order to like pit people of color against each other, essentially.

467
00:49:04,690 --> 00:49:11,049
But we are seen as othered in terms of like we are not white, but we are also not minority.

468
00:49:11,050 --> 00:49:18,040
So a lot of times our own allyship is only within our own communities and not even the entire racial community,

469
00:49:18,040 --> 00:49:27,070
specifically the ethnic community, because there are a lot of different dynamics between like East Asians, Southeast Asians, like South Asians.

470
00:49:27,910 --> 00:49:36,280
So it's very complex. So I would say that this still has has largely like, I don't know, continued to fly under the radar.

471
00:49:36,280 --> 00:49:40,240
The hate crimes continue. Like I said, because of the nature of the work that I do,

472
00:49:40,600 --> 00:49:43,809
I really connect like contact contacted when I started working here like well you

473
00:49:43,810 --> 00:49:47,709
do an interview with Vox where you do an interview you view with like Detroit,

474
00:49:47,710 --> 00:49:51,730
Fox News, whatever 59 or whatever the station and it's I just said like, no,

475
00:49:52,180 --> 00:49:57,190
I'm not trying to be like I have hate mail sent to me because like our faculty of color

476
00:49:57,490 --> 00:50:03,610
who do even what I would consider like less controversial research like black kids in.

477
00:50:03,660 --> 00:50:10,730
Detroit in public schools need more nutrition and they get like some wild like they told me they get some wild stuff emailed them.

478
00:50:11,120 --> 00:50:17,570
So I'm like, I'm not trying to be hate crime but yet so the math and the link to the Pew study.

479
00:50:18,050 --> 00:50:21,350
Oh, the Pew study. Yes, yes, yes, yes. I'll put it on canvas.

480
00:50:26,480 --> 00:50:32,470
I'll put an announcement. Okay. Mm hmm.

481
00:50:35,050 --> 00:50:41,140
Okay. And I know this sounds silly. So I growing up in California, as I mentioned, I grew up in a very diverse community.

482
00:50:41,530 --> 00:50:48,910
So I never particularly thought of myself, of my race or ethnicity until I moved to Nebraska.

483
00:50:48,940 --> 00:50:56,769
Like, it wasn't until like I was 24 that I was like, I'm Asian and you know, I know that sounds and I know that sounds wild,

484
00:50:56,770 --> 00:51:05,889
but I never really like I never really thought of it as like a huge part of my identity just because it's like this is the way that life is.

485
00:51:05,890 --> 00:51:12,580
And like, we all like, are very multicultural in Sacramento and like, you know, we just, like, do things together.

486
00:51:12,580 --> 00:51:17,500
And it's not like a point of, like, focus.

487
00:51:17,620 --> 00:51:23,169
Like, even when I was, you know, they have they're like high school, college advising classes.

488
00:51:23,170 --> 00:51:28,899
Like we were never told in particular to, like, play up the fact that you're like poor minority kids.

489
00:51:28,900 --> 00:51:33,370
We were just they were just like, this is how you, like, write your essay and stuff like that.

490
00:51:34,390 --> 00:51:39,850
So I would definitely say personally for me during the pandemic,

491
00:51:39,850 --> 00:51:49,040
I was less concerned about getting COVID and more concerned about like going outside in public, especially because I had just moved here to Michigan.

492
00:51:49,660 --> 00:51:54,670
They just tried to kidnap the governor. I was like, I don't know.

493
00:51:54,880 --> 00:51:59,110
I mean, Ann Arbor is safe, but I really didn't know like much about like other cities.

494
00:51:59,110 --> 00:52:05,769
And some people are like, don't go to like Livingston County or like go up north like near Whitmore Lake and stuff like that.

495
00:52:05,770 --> 00:52:15,819
So I was like, you know, stay in the house. But anyways, I just wanted to highlight like what can happen when incorrect naming of a disease.

496
00:52:15,820 --> 00:52:18,820
And then it just like takes off like wildflower fire.

497
00:52:18,820 --> 00:52:28,600
And there's been a ton of more social media studies about this that have come out if you're interested, thoughts or comments before I move on.

498
00:52:32,150 --> 00:52:38,180
Okay. I think I talk later about Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus, so that's not a good one either.

499
00:52:40,010 --> 00:52:43,180
So let's get into a yes page.

500
00:52:43,460 --> 00:52:49,940
Oh, so I know there have been I know I saw like recently like commercial advertising with kids and I hate the stuff.

501
00:52:50,360 --> 00:52:55,669
Is that anything to do with like the Public Health Service or is that more like that is more like

502
00:52:55,670 --> 00:53:03,530
individual organizations like Stopasianhate is like an Asian American Pacific Islander based organization.

503
00:53:03,900 --> 00:53:07,280
I don't know how much it's actually like taken off.

504
00:53:08,280 --> 00:53:12,270
To be honest, I ran out of something. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

505
00:53:14,020 --> 00:53:17,979
I only had one friend express allyship to me. She's biracial.

506
00:53:17,980 --> 00:53:21,340
She's half Indian, like south, like South Asian.

507
00:53:21,580 --> 00:53:29,080
So I was like, thank you. But I was I was very concerned for, like, family members and who.

508
00:53:29,440 --> 00:53:33,190
Okay. So notable. Yes, Bernie.

509
00:53:33,760 --> 00:53:39,120
No worries. On one side, you mentioned the Hate Crimes Act of 2021.

510
00:53:39,130 --> 00:53:43,360
Yeah. Was that written to address the Asian hate crimes?

511
00:53:43,420 --> 00:53:48,010
Yes, it's written like in a broad, like kind of Noah specifically for like the COVID stuff.

512
00:53:49,120 --> 00:53:53,620
Some people voted against it. You can look at who, you can look up who.

513
00:53:53,620 --> 00:54:01,270
But yeah, it was specifically like towards COVID. But there is not any like punitive stuff.

514
00:54:01,840 --> 00:54:05,440
It's more just like don't do it, you know?

515
00:54:06,310 --> 00:54:09,790
And in particular, like when you look at these specific studies,

516
00:54:09,790 --> 00:54:18,350
even with like black people and dealings with the police, they're always like suspected to be racially motivated.

517
00:54:18,370 --> 00:54:24,400
Like, they won't just like they're very like they're like very hesitant to come out and say it.

518
00:54:24,410 --> 00:54:28,180
And that also deters people from reporting as well.

519
00:54:29,680 --> 00:54:34,390
There was a there's a professor here. Oh, I forget her name. I think she's in the policy department.

520
00:54:34,660 --> 00:54:43,420
But she recently did a study that showed the number of firearms purchased by Asian-American Pacific Islanders have also gone up

521
00:54:43,420 --> 00:54:51,219
during this time because they feel like the like the entities that are there to support them aren't actually going to be there.

522
00:54:51,220 --> 00:54:56,510
So they need to take matters into their own hands, to each their own.

523
00:54:56,530 --> 00:55:00,430
I am not I don't own a gun for this person.

524
00:55:00,660 --> 00:55:03,870
I would certainly shoot me knowing myself.

525
00:55:03,880 --> 00:55:07,660
But, you know, I think it's like an unfortunate situation,

526
00:55:07,660 --> 00:55:16,040
an unfortunate public health issue that breeds another public health issue that breeds another public health issue.

527
00:55:16,060 --> 00:55:19,530
So that makes sense. Okay.

528
00:55:22,730 --> 00:55:26,300
So some notable outbreaks that we will talk about.

529
00:55:26,840 --> 00:55:36,950
Polio is bad H1N1, influenza, polio, a cryptosporidium outbreak, HIV AIDS, H1N1, and then COVID 19 again.

530
00:55:37,280 --> 00:55:42,350
Where you put the I put the end date. That was me being optimistic when I made these slides.

531
00:55:42,950 --> 00:55:50,389
So the 1918 H1N1 influenza, it is no longer the most severe in recent history.

532
00:55:50,390 --> 00:55:57,620
COVID 19 has outdone it, but this was caused by an H1N1 virus with genes of avian origin.

533
00:55:57,950 --> 00:56:03,709
But there's no universal consensus, really, about where or when it spread or how it started,

534
00:56:03,710 --> 00:56:12,380
because you can imagine the technology in surveillance and epidemiological tracking in the early 20th century was not what it was today.

535
00:56:12,380 --> 00:56:19,460
Right. But this was first identified in U.S. military personnel in 1918 during the First World War.

536
00:56:19,910 --> 00:56:30,680
And it's estimated that a third of the world population at that time became infected with the virus with 50 million deaths, U.S. 675,000 deaths.

537
00:56:31,580 --> 00:56:40,820
And interestingly, the mortality was high in those less than five years old, but those 20 to 40 and those older than 65.

538
00:56:42,500 --> 00:56:51,620
And the reason for this being is that there was a previous similar strain of H1N1 that came through in years earlier.

539
00:56:51,620 --> 00:57:02,330
So those older populations and those who are considered like middle aged had already been exposed and developed immunity to that previous strain.

540
00:57:02,660 --> 00:57:06,739
So when this strain came around, they had some natural immunity from it.

541
00:57:06,740 --> 00:57:11,540
So that's why we kind of see it uncharacteristically getting to the 20 and 40 year old age.

542
00:57:12,890 --> 00:57:21,590
I had written a paper about this in undergrad, but it was also because of the war, like no country has been like sharing data with anybody else.

543
00:57:22,490 --> 00:57:25,640
So that's why it's called like the Spanish flu, because, you know,

544
00:57:26,060 --> 00:57:31,250
they were the first ones to notify everybody this thing and then everyone's like, okay, in Spain.

545
00:57:32,090 --> 00:57:35,120
Yeah, yeah. Thank you for sharing page.

546
00:57:36,440 --> 00:57:39,800
Yeah, that wasn't a good cop. But, you know, hindsight honeybee.

547
00:57:40,640 --> 00:57:43,430
So this came in multiple waves, just like COVID.

548
00:57:44,270 --> 00:57:52,460
The second wave came between September and November in the U.S. And so the New York City Board of Health, so early on,

549
00:57:52,850 --> 00:57:58,129
city boards of health were like the front line of public health,

550
00:57:58,130 --> 00:58:02,600
and they were generally the quickest to respond, especially in larger cities like New York and Boston.

551
00:58:02,930 --> 00:58:08,060
So they did add the flu to a list of reportable diseases because like, hey, we're going to start tracking it.

552
00:58:08,390 --> 00:58:14,090
And they did require all flu cases to either isolate at home or you come to the city hospital.

553
00:58:14,420 --> 00:58:18,860
Again, there was a shortage of health care workers because a lot of people were abroad fighting the war.

554
00:58:18,860 --> 00:58:22,700
Efforts in robust surveillance was not available yet.

555
00:58:23,120 --> 00:58:28,280
Oh, this sounds familiar. Major cities started using cold storage plants as temporary morgues.

556
00:58:28,640 --> 00:58:36,500
So here during COVID, we've had to use other cold storage assets like meat warehouses, mobile refrigeration trucks,

557
00:58:36,500 --> 00:58:43,640
ice skating rinks to put bodies before they could be like appropriately handled the morgue.

558
00:58:43,940 --> 00:58:52,700
So same thing here. Major cities started closing theaters, movie houses, night schools, places of public gathering.

559
00:58:52,970 --> 00:58:58,520
The San Francisco Board of Health required any person serving in the public to wear a mask.

560
00:59:00,410 --> 00:59:09,649
And it wasn't until December that public officials started education programs about the dangers of wildly coughing and sneezing,

561
00:59:09,650 --> 00:59:18,350
which I really like this term careless disposal of nasal discharges, which people still do that all the time.

562
00:59:19,130 --> 00:59:23,270
Yes, Pete. Yes. In San Francisco specifically.

563
00:59:23,270 --> 00:59:26,569
And there was also like a huge like anti-mask like thing. Oh, yeah.

564
00:59:26,570 --> 00:59:30,410
Like it's like rallies and like parades down the street wear a mask.

565
00:59:30,740 --> 00:59:37,310
And I think, like, the like they would get arrested if they weren't caught in public, like not wearing a mask, like, yeah, yeah.

566
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:43,250
So this is all just like 100 years later, we've learned nothing.

567
00:59:43,250 --> 00:59:49,159
Is that there? Is this there? So there was a third wave in the spring at this point.

568
00:59:49,160 --> 00:59:56,120
They were like, leave it up to the cities. Then in the fourth wave in 20, they had quarantined social distancing.

569
00:59:56,120 --> 01:00:00,890
They shut down essential services, try to use hygiene, use disinfectants.

570
01:00:01,400 --> 01:00:03,860
And then people were returning from the war.

571
01:00:03,860 --> 01:00:11,929
So public health professionals and volunteer and lawyers and nurses were able to deploy, but there was no vaccine or really antibiotic treatment.

572
01:00:11,930 --> 01:00:14,930
But again, this was a viral infection.

573
01:00:14,930 --> 01:00:19,640
But you could get a secondary bacterial infection from like getting you.

574
01:00:20,420 --> 01:00:24,709
That, like how you can get sepsis or you can get it pneumonia or other things from COVID.

575
01:00:24,710 --> 01:00:27,800
So no antibiotic treatments for the secondary infections.

576
01:00:28,160 --> 01:00:31,640
So state governments asked their residents to flatten the curve.

577
01:00:31,670 --> 01:00:34,670
That is not a new term either. Okay.

578
01:00:35,690 --> 01:00:39,440
So yeah. So the etiology of the disease was unknown.

579
01:00:39,440 --> 01:00:48,260
So the international office d'hygiene, which is now the World Health Organization, they again recommended closures,

580
01:00:48,950 --> 01:00:53,180
but the government was super tied up with the Great War, so the response was not robust.

581
01:00:53,190 --> 01:00:59,900
So you had a lot of like nonprofits and religious groups coming out of the woodwork like Red Cross and churches.

582
01:01:00,230 --> 01:01:05,870
So you can see here this is a photo of Seattle, Washington, during the 1918 influenza.

583
01:01:05,870 --> 01:01:10,519
So they would not permit anybody to ride on the street car without a mask.

584
01:01:10,520 --> 01:01:15,400
And they distributed almost 300,000 masks in three days.

585
01:01:15,410 --> 01:01:22,190
But back then, they were more like like the kind not to put attention on a new.

586
01:01:22,190 --> 01:01:25,280
But you're wearing a triple layered surgical mask.

587
01:01:25,280 --> 01:01:35,479
This was not the same quality or style like polio, which has been so quick to fade out of people's memories.

588
01:01:35,480 --> 01:01:41,840
But as of like yesterday or the day before, the state of New York has declared a state of emergency and a polio outbreak.

589
01:01:42,320 --> 01:01:50,299
So from 1916 to 1955, so polio is a virus that causes disabling and life threatening disease.

590
01:01:50,300 --> 01:01:58,070
So once it spreads, it can spread from person to person and affects the spinal cord, which can result in paralysis and shorten lifespan.

591
01:01:58,430 --> 01:02:03,530
So here you see a person inside an iron lung essentially to help with breathing,

592
01:02:03,530 --> 01:02:08,270
since polio also weakens your lung muscles and your respiratory muscle.

593
01:02:09,050 --> 01:02:15,740
Franklin D Roosevelt famously had polio, which left him in a wheelchair for most of his life.

594
01:02:16,310 --> 01:02:25,969
So the United States has been polio free since 1979 due to mostly successful vaccination programs.

595
01:02:25,970 --> 01:02:35,780
So you have folks, again, either because of, you know, various religious beliefs or cultural beliefs that are now opting not to get the polio vaccine.

596
01:02:35,780 --> 01:02:41,509
It's a three shot series. Again, my sister lives in New York City, even though I am the younger one.

597
01:02:41,510 --> 01:02:49,970
Between the two, I am the more adult one. So I carry my vaccine records because we both were from California.

598
01:02:50,270 --> 01:02:53,329
I carry vaccine my vaccine records in a fireproof safe.

599
01:02:53,330 --> 01:02:57,770
And I bring it around the country with me because I'm like, I don't trust the health care system here.

600
01:02:58,160 --> 01:03:02,209
So when I heard about this, you know, the first cases of polio in New York City,

601
01:03:02,210 --> 01:03:08,030
I went over to my fireproof safe and I was like, oh, good, I have all three.

602
01:03:08,330 --> 01:03:14,270
And my sister texts me and was like, Do I have the polio vaccine?

603
01:03:14,270 --> 01:03:17,629
And I was like, Dude, like, how am I supposed to know?

604
01:03:17,630 --> 01:03:24,110
Like, do you have your vaccine card? And she was like, Yeah, I do. But it's like not I don't have all of it.

605
01:03:24,110 --> 01:03:31,729
And I was like, I would assume mom and dad got them for you, but like, you should look into that.

606
01:03:31,730 --> 01:03:39,890
And I was like, I don't know how to I don't know how to help you, but the great thing is that they are still administering small polio vaccines.

607
01:03:40,160 --> 01:03:47,690
They stopped administering the smallpox vaccine here in the United States when they were like, oh, it's eradicated now.

608
01:03:48,260 --> 01:03:58,850
So in the 1940s, pre vaccine, polio outbreaks caused more than 35,000 cases of paralysis per year.

609
01:04:00,080 --> 01:04:10,280
And shortly after this disease creation, they established a national polio surveillance unit headed by the Epidemic Intelligence Service or EIC.

610
01:04:11,030 --> 01:04:14,870
How many of you have heard of that? Yes. Yeah.

611
01:04:14,870 --> 01:04:20,959
So they're uniformed officers as well that are in the CDC and they get deployed kind of like the Public Health Service,

612
01:04:20,960 --> 01:04:28,270
which Liz will talk about on Thursday. But you know, pre vaccine as a preventative measure,

613
01:04:28,480 --> 01:04:36,400
families would keep their kids from going outside or going into large crowds in the summer because it is spread through like contact and droplets.

614
01:04:36,820 --> 01:04:40,570
So like, that's why like kids were like shuttered and just, you know,

615
01:04:41,020 --> 01:04:48,420
play with their siblings or like very early versions of TV, travel and commerce between affected cities were restricted.

616
01:04:48,430 --> 01:04:56,610
So if like San Francisco had a huge outbreak, for example, like they're not letting people come in and out of it and then people impose quarantine.

617
01:04:56,620 --> 01:05:03,970
So because FDR had been affected by it, he was huge and doing like a lot of public health messaging.

618
01:05:04,240 --> 01:05:09,700
His famous fireside radio chats included a lot of campaigning for polio.

619
01:05:10,810 --> 01:05:14,430
Army volunteers collected dimes to help pay for the research.

620
01:05:14,430 --> 01:05:16,240
Still, March of Dimes polio.

621
01:05:16,660 --> 01:05:24,819
They used celebrities like Elvis, for example, to encourage people to get vaccinated, and they did support research efforts.

622
01:05:24,820 --> 01:05:35,719
So the CDC did work collaboratively with Dr. Salk and Dr. Sabin to develop a vaccine that there had a term just not right at the time.

623
01:05:35,720 --> 01:05:47,230
It was like promoting, like getting vaccinated against polio or taking these precautions as polarized in the US as present day.

624
01:05:47,350 --> 01:05:51,160
Because I'm wondering about like using a celebrity like Elvis.

625
01:05:51,310 --> 01:05:58,930
I feel like some celebrities now might be more polarizing because they don't want to be seen as taking one side or the other.

626
01:05:58,930 --> 01:06:03,669
And maybe like a more liberal celebrity who's very vocal about their politics,

627
01:06:03,670 --> 01:06:08,760
might be saying something from doing something for COVID and then that continues.

628
01:06:09,160 --> 01:06:15,370
Yeah. When at so maybe this slide maybe next week again.

629
01:06:15,390 --> 01:06:22,060
Remember, ever since the invention of vaccines, there's always been people that I hate that against it.

630
01:06:22,360 --> 01:06:28,809
But because in a very visual way this was affecting the United States community,

631
01:06:28,810 --> 01:06:33,670
there wasn't as much pushback as there is now because you literally have paralyzed children.

632
01:06:34,000 --> 01:06:39,940
And when you have diseases that affect children more, the public is more likely to act.

633
01:06:42,860 --> 01:06:45,050
Maybe. Is it too early for this anecdote?

634
01:06:46,760 --> 01:06:54,580
So so just what I was going to say, the Salk Institute is in San Diego where I went to college, so it's super cool.

635
01:06:54,590 --> 01:07:02,720
And they did develop the inactivated intravenous vaccine in 1955, and then they have an oral version of the vaccine in 1963.

636
01:07:03,920 --> 01:07:10,140
So take this what you will. I heard this on a podcast when I was like getting ready one morning.

637
01:07:10,160 --> 01:07:13,190
So this is me repeating to you like the details of the podcast.

638
01:07:14,060 --> 01:07:18,500
But I'm not a ethicists, but there's people who do ethical studies all the time.

639
01:07:18,500 --> 01:07:27,230
So like how many of you watch the good place? And they talked about like that train situation, like the train ethical train scenario.

640
01:07:27,650 --> 01:07:40,880
So some ethicists at the start of COVID did like some ethical studies regarding like who do the who does the general public care more about?

641
01:07:41,870 --> 01:07:49,129
So like, okay, you have a train and you have like a child and then like an adult and you come only like season one.

642
01:07:49,130 --> 01:07:52,700
Like who do you like push out of the way, right?

643
01:07:53,000 --> 01:07:57,770
So generally time and time again, it will be like the younger folks, it will be the children.

644
01:07:58,070 --> 01:08:05,540
And when you're in a scenario where it is a old person and the young person oftentimes like these are qualitative interviews.

645
01:08:05,870 --> 01:08:08,629
So the old person, older person would say,

646
01:08:08,630 --> 01:08:19,100
like they would sacrifice themselves for the young person because they have lived the life like this young person has potential to like cure cancer.

647
01:08:19,100 --> 01:08:21,320
Just go big tactile dances like I don't know.

648
01:08:21,650 --> 01:08:29,420
But like the sad thing was that like when it came down, like they did all kinds of like permutations of scenarios cats,

649
01:08:29,420 --> 01:08:36,710
dogs, babies, bla animals were prioritized over the elderly.

650
01:08:37,730 --> 01:08:44,270
And we did see that during like COVID, where there's kind of like this brazenness about like my rights.

651
01:08:44,270 --> 01:08:48,170
Like I go to Applebee's if I want to and I don't care if I kill Grandma.

652
01:08:48,180 --> 01:08:50,450
That's a very reductive way of putting it.

653
01:08:50,450 --> 01:09:01,490
But we did see this kind of like brazenness and regard toward the health of like elderly Americans in exchange for what we consider like freedom.

654
01:09:01,850 --> 01:09:07,879
So polio, because it did affect children more disproportionately, was definitely like pulling at people's,

655
01:09:07,880 --> 01:09:14,420
ah, altruism and and heartstrings in terms of like how fast they wanted to support research efforts.

656
01:09:15,340 --> 01:09:20,510
A couple of weekends ago, I watched our Elvis the Elvis movie because on the HBO.

657
01:09:20,510 --> 01:09:24,829
Max Interesting, but I don't know how accurate that actually was.

658
01:09:24,830 --> 01:09:31,010
He seemed like he was a polarizing figure just because of like the kind of music he performed and his,

659
01:09:31,010 --> 01:09:33,980
like, provocative theme dancing and stuff like that.

660
01:09:34,490 --> 01:09:42,020
So I don't really feel like they really leverage celebrities for the COVID vaccine effort because it would be very different if it was like,

661
01:09:42,770 --> 01:09:50,089
I don't know, like if like Cardi B told you to get the vaccine versus like Taylor Swift told you to get the vaccine.

662
01:09:50,090 --> 01:09:54,800
They brought Olivia Rodrigo to the White House because they were like, TMZ, you should get vaccinated.

663
01:09:55,130 --> 01:10:03,380
Or like if they got like, I forget his name, that country singer who like kind of got canceled for using racial slurs for enrolling.

664
01:10:03,440 --> 01:10:11,600
Yes. Thank you. But some people really love him now, so I don't know how effective Elvis was.

665
01:10:12,980 --> 01:10:19,940
Okay. So 1993 in Milwaukee, we have cryptosporidium outbreak.

666
01:10:20,360 --> 01:10:30,860
So thus far, this has been the largest waterborne outbreak documented in U.S. history, directly caused by a protozoans.

667
01:10:30,860 --> 01:10:38,269
Right. So when we're talking about waterborne issues, like Flint was a very different type of crisis.

668
01:10:38,270 --> 01:10:42,200
What's going on in Benton Harbor right now is a very different crisis.

669
01:10:42,890 --> 01:10:47,840
What's going to happen in two com in Jackson, Mississippi is a very different crisis.

670
01:10:47,840 --> 01:10:52,790
But this particularly was narrowed down to this specific pathogen.

671
01:10:53,750 --> 01:10:59,000
So it's suspected it came from one or two, one of two water treatment plants in the city,

672
01:10:59,000 --> 01:11:06,230
and it affected about 400,000 Milwaukee citizens, resulting in illness and hospitalization.

673
01:11:06,650 --> 01:11:18,080
So they did make immediate repairs to the treatment facilities, but it did result in a 25 year long infrastructure upgrade that was also initiated.

674
01:11:18,080 --> 01:11:24,620
So bulk of it was $510 million in repairs and upgrades and outreach to the citizens,

675
01:11:24,980 --> 01:11:31,190
$96 million in direct medical expenses and productivity lost the direct and indirect costs.

676
01:11:31,700 --> 01:11:37,850
But this underscores, again, the need for primary prevention, not just for health, but also for infrastructure.

677
01:11:38,660 --> 01:11:42,320
Silver My online class, they're pretty ahead of you guys, but.

678
01:11:43,500 --> 01:11:47,210
Tomorrow night in discussion, we'll talk heavily about Jackson, Mississippi.

679
01:11:47,220 --> 01:11:49,170
So if you've kind of kept your eye on it,

680
01:11:49,620 --> 01:11:58,709
the lot of the flooding and issues that have occurred in Jackson have been from long neglected infrastructure because the city is

681
01:11:58,710 --> 01:12:10,610
predominantly about 80% black and because of like environmental racism just have not been kept or like focused on in any way.

682
01:12:10,620 --> 01:12:13,980
Same kind of thing we saw happen in Flint, Benton Harbor.

683
01:12:14,190 --> 01:12:16,890
Mostly black and brown communities.

684
01:12:17,940 --> 01:12:29,670
So, you know, people often outside of public health, when you tell them, like this is for primary prevention and you show them a huge number,

685
01:12:30,540 --> 01:12:39,260
they don't comprehend potentially what the return on investment can be like in the future because like, it's very difficult to quantify.

686
01:12:39,270 --> 01:12:42,870
So you just kind of have to try to tell them more like evidence shows this.

687
01:12:43,230 --> 01:12:50,910
But people would rather spend their money, like in the moment, you know, trying to put a Band-Aid on like a huge gaping wound.

688
01:12:50,910 --> 01:13:02,610
Then primary prevention, the United States infrastructure, like the the National Society of Engineers did a survey on United States infrastructure.

689
01:13:02,610 --> 01:13:08,990
And for most of our water facilities, we only have about a good 40 years left before mode.

690
01:13:09,000 --> 01:13:14,010
Should most of them reach like total collapse if we don't start repairing things.

691
01:13:14,640 --> 01:13:16,709
Same with our roads and same with that.

692
01:13:16,710 --> 01:13:23,730
So I know like President Biden recently rolled out a huge infrastructure bill, but like these things take time and then like,

693
01:13:24,240 --> 01:13:33,540
you know, people are only in office at minimum 4 to 8 years and the change of hands and then priorities change, etc., etc.

694
01:13:33,540 --> 01:13:38,580
So these are kind of like how these issues continue to fall through the cracks.

695
01:13:40,110 --> 01:13:49,530
Look how many slides we have on this. Okay.

696
01:13:49,530 --> 01:13:57,690
I can do it. Okay. So in 2009, we had the H1N1 influenza A, so the origins of the virus was identified in Mexico.

697
01:13:57,960 --> 01:14:07,020
As you can imagine, the names it started with before they settled on this one, and it did negatively impact tourism to Mexico.

698
01:14:07,260 --> 01:14:13,680
But this was swine to human viral transmission. Pigs are so smart.

699
01:14:14,490 --> 01:14:18,600
Do I eat pork? Yes. But they are they are very smart.

700
01:14:18,990 --> 01:14:23,700
And they're some of their processes are very similar to humans.

701
01:14:23,700 --> 01:14:28,230
So like in heart transplants now, they'll now use swine organs.

702
01:14:28,500 --> 01:14:37,379
The interesting thing about swine viruses in particular, generally with zoonotic cross over bird to bird,

703
01:14:37,380 --> 01:14:42,810
generally state, bird to bird, bird to human doesn't happen that often.

704
01:14:42,810 --> 01:14:50,700
There used to be this funny CDC infographic I showed a couple of years ago at some of my old trainings where the person was like.

705
01:14:51,930 --> 01:14:55,860
Just like caressing their chicken, like because, you know, some people have have chickens and,

706
01:14:56,430 --> 01:15:00,509
you know, the virus can be shed in their feces and then the dust is kicked up.

707
01:15:00,510 --> 01:15:05,549
And if you're, like, coming into close contact with a chicken like avian to human transmission,

708
01:15:05,550 --> 01:15:10,740
that way human to human generally stays human to human.

709
01:15:11,610 --> 01:15:16,739
But swine strains of virus in particular are very great at adapting.

710
01:15:16,740 --> 01:15:20,969
And they can do recombinant DNA with avian strains,

711
01:15:20,970 --> 01:15:28,620
human strains and other animal strains so that what makes it more difficult to like, track down and treat.

712
01:15:29,160 --> 01:15:40,410
So this was one of the most severe recent outbreaks since 2017 of two seasonal flu, and it mostly impacted children young and middle age adults.

713
01:15:40,830 --> 01:15:48,380
So they suspected that there was anywhere between 700 million to 1.4 billion cases worldwide.

714
01:15:48,390 --> 01:15:51,450
Why that huge range? Because testing wasn't that great then.

715
01:15:51,450 --> 01:15:56,520
And that was like 29. There were only less than half a million of lab confirmed cases, though.

716
01:15:57,300 --> 01:16:07,050
And in the deaths it was estimated that there were 284 deaths worldwide, but there were only less than 20,000 lab confirmed deaths.

717
01:16:07,440 --> 01:16:11,130
And about 13,000 people died here in the United States.

718
01:16:12,720 --> 01:16:20,850
So the U.S. did mount a pretty con, multifaceted response to this pandemic when President Obama was in office.

719
01:16:20,850 --> 01:16:24,690
So all levels of government began ramping up pandemic response.

720
01:16:24,690 --> 01:16:28,169
Like almost immediately they conducted surveillance.

721
01:16:28,170 --> 01:16:31,380
In response, they bolstered the nation's lab capabilities.

722
01:16:31,710 --> 01:16:39,630
They try to share evidence based guidelines really early and they research developed and tried to distribute like an H1N1 vaccine.

723
01:16:41,100 --> 01:16:46,110
The World Health Organization, though, declared this pandemic over in August.

724
01:16:46,110 --> 01:16:57,330
Sorry, that should say 2010. 2010 didn't go that long, but this strain of virus does still exist and continues to circulate as the seasonal flu.

725
01:16:57,660 --> 01:17:04,500
So it does still result in global illness, hospitalization and death, but not nearly to the effect in which we saw the strain.

726
01:17:04,500 --> 01:17:08,370
And I did get this my sophomore year of college.

727
01:17:08,370 --> 01:17:14,579
I was down, I was down, and I still tried to go to calculus.

728
01:17:14,580 --> 01:17:19,709
I remember this because they took attendance. So the college was so big.

729
01:17:19,710 --> 01:17:30,300
So I like had like it was like a I had like a wild fever and I like rolled out of my dorm bed and just, like, took the campus shuttle to calculus,

730
01:17:30,300 --> 01:17:39,629
sat there, don't remember any of the lecture, maybe scribbled some notes and then like rolled back into my bed.

731
01:17:39,630 --> 01:17:40,620
I was pretty sick.

732
01:17:40,620 --> 01:17:49,290
But, you know, 19 year old me then did not think about like, oh, I'm just like spreading like my droplets and my fomites everywhere.

733
01:17:49,290 --> 01:17:52,320
I was just like, I need to get into medical school.

734
01:17:53,430 --> 01:17:59,129
So a very different time for me. Anyways, we'll stop there for today.

735
01:17:59,130 --> 01:18:05,580
I'll pick up on HIV AIDS on Thursday and then.

736
01:18:07,800 --> 01:18:11,280
Yeah, and your next homework is do this weekend.
