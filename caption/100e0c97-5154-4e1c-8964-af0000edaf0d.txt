1
00:00:00,450 --> 00:00:03,890
You just might take.

2
00:00:04,300 --> 00:00:14,730
I think that we all have the titles.

3
00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:47,890
Just like you just called me in three days, and I'm like, you know, might have been really good and you have to have something pure at some point.

4
00:00:49,890 --> 00:00:57,010
I got to say, you know, I have a car.

5
00:00:57,610 --> 00:01:16,680
My first thought, I mean, you look anything like this, as great as one of the main street cards.

6
00:01:18,810 --> 00:01:22,170
Oh, it was so it was so good.

7
00:01:22,170 --> 00:01:36,550
It was incredible. I mean, I enjoyed doing this, and I was like, I don't know how to feel about that.

8
00:01:37,170 --> 00:01:40,950
I mean, it was so good.

9
00:01:41,260 --> 00:02:08,280
So good. You should just stand down because the building and and well, we were talking.

10
00:02:09,690 --> 00:02:17,580
So there's nothing if you like something like that if you took a.

11
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:28,330
No one is saying, Oh, he's going to stick stickers.

12
00:02:29,470 --> 00:02:49,780
I suppose it's only because sometimes they say, Oh, it'll be like a person that I'm going to be exposed to this thing.

13
00:02:51,150 --> 00:03:12,100
Like the first team that was supposed to shoot this stretch was the start to the.

14
00:03:27,500 --> 00:03:47,590
Think. Okay.

15
00:03:49,730 --> 00:03:58,220
We're going to follow in the air this morning in the thirties this morning, huh?

16
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:09,250
So hopefully you had a nice, relaxing weekend and you got to maybe go to a cider mill.

17
00:04:10,260 --> 00:04:15,060
You do that on Friday. A nice experience on The View in the fall.

18
00:04:15,750 --> 00:04:20,770
So there are several cider mills in and around in Arbor.

19
00:04:22,230 --> 00:04:28,510
What's the what's your favorite ones? That's when you get a bunch of a bunch of students went out to on Friday.

20
00:04:29,350 --> 00:04:33,280
Those of you who are in this area, what's your what's your favorite cider mill?

21
00:04:34,180 --> 00:04:39,520
Dexter Cider mills. Pretty good. Dexter Yeah. I've been there once about Blossoms.

22
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:43,870
Have you been to Awesome City? Yeah, they have a huge area where you can go pick apples there.

23
00:04:43,870 --> 00:04:53,860
And that's that's a pretty cool place to go. So in regard to the quiz.

24
00:04:54,220 --> 00:04:58,690
Everybody did pretty well. There's a lot to talk about today.

25
00:04:58,690 --> 00:05:02,110
So if you have questions about that, I can address those.

26
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:12,520
Otherwise, we're going to jump into the lecture. The other thing that I want to mention before we start today's lecture is Exam one.

27
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:16,149
I'll mention more details as we go through.

28
00:05:16,150 --> 00:05:24,459
But in terms of the the way that the types of questions you should expect to see there, so there are going to be some multiple choice.

29
00:05:24,460 --> 00:05:28,570
There's going to be no matching. There's going to be a fill in the blank.

30
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:31,720
There's going to be short essay questions on the exam.

31
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:42,560
So expect to see that in that type of format. So I'm planning on having a in class exam.

32
00:05:43,370 --> 00:05:51,709
So you'll have a paper to write on. I haven't done this for since before the pandemic, so hopefully country thing is as it is now.

33
00:05:51,710 --> 00:05:59,240
We'll be able to do that in class. So today we're going to be talking about the regulation of appetite and satiety,

34
00:05:59,540 --> 00:06:07,280
and we're going to focus on what's going on in the central nervous system to talk about critical inputs.

35
00:06:07,880 --> 00:06:12,740
But that will be the topic of discussion on Wednesday.

36
00:06:14,030 --> 00:06:18,049
So this is complicated and I'm going to walk you through this slowly.

37
00:06:18,050 --> 00:06:23,270
So there's going to be a fair amount of redundancy as we go through the slide back today.

38
00:06:24,990 --> 00:06:34,110
So in terms of. In terms of my animation control, it's not working for some reason the way some of the stuff is set up.

39
00:06:35,010 --> 00:06:41,100
So in terms of the learning objectives, I want you to be able to describe the long,

40
00:06:41,460 --> 00:06:48,690
short and long term signals that control energy homeostasis, understand the neural circuits,

41
00:06:48,690 --> 00:06:50,370
and these are kind of complicated,

42
00:06:50,370 --> 00:06:58,440
but we're going to go through these one step at a time to understand the research and how they're involved in controlling appetite and satiety.

43
00:06:59,250 --> 00:07:05,580
You should be able to describe the integration of the homeostatic and hedonic inputs that regulate appetite and satiety,

44
00:07:07,050 --> 00:07:12,210
and then finally explain how these emergency circuits can inhibit feeding.

45
00:07:16,790 --> 00:07:22,260
So. In which case they are going to work.

46
00:07:22,290 --> 00:07:25,590
Okay, cool. I just can't see them. Okay.

47
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:36,450
So in terms of an overview of the central nervous system regulation of energy homeostasis,

48
00:07:36,450 --> 00:07:43,560
you have a bunch of different inputs coming into the brain to inform the brain about the nutritional status of the host.

49
00:07:44,460 --> 00:07:56,310
And these signals come from the adipose tissue in the form of leptin, the hormone that can regulate appetite satiety.

50
00:07:57,300 --> 00:08:06,300
And you have insulin, which is produced in correlation with adipose tissue levels.

51
00:08:06,930 --> 00:08:16,110
So these are long term signals. Okay. They can change pretty quickly, but they represent the long term storage of energy.

52
00:08:19,160 --> 00:08:24,560
The second is a nutrient related signal that comes from the gut.

53
00:08:25,640 --> 00:08:38,300
And these signals can come in the form of glucose and fatty acids, and they're within the acute nucleus.

54
00:08:38,330 --> 00:08:46,310
You have your neuro nerve centers that can sense changes in blood glucose.

55
00:08:47,150 --> 00:08:56,270
Blood glucose is the preferred energy substrate of the brain, and it's worked most efficiently with adequate levels of glucose.

56
00:08:56,960 --> 00:09:03,650
So this is an important nutrient related signal in terms of energy status.

57
00:09:07,820 --> 00:09:19,640
Then you have some satiety signals and the satiety signals refer to the blue lines going to different regions of the system.

58
00:09:19,970 --> 00:09:23,480
This doesn't even show up. So I'm going to have to use this today.

59
00:09:24,620 --> 00:09:35,719
So these are the satiety signals coming from places like the intestine in the form of color coded in the genome,

60
00:09:35,720 --> 00:09:43,220
if you want, and stomach in terms of the mechanical stretching of the stomach.

61
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:48,320
And these are short term signals. They're short lived.

62
00:09:48,380 --> 00:09:55,130
They can inhibit feeding in a short period of in a in a minutes, minutes to hours.

63
00:09:55,520 --> 00:09:59,480
But they reside are they they decline rapidly.

64
00:10:02,300 --> 00:10:09,290
That's true. Or that the hormones produced in the gut in response to having just in.

65
00:10:12,500 --> 00:10:20,030
And then these signals or of hunger or satiety appetite or satiety are integrated

66
00:10:20,030 --> 00:10:23,870
within the brain and in a walk through this at how this process occurs.

67
00:10:24,410 --> 00:10:31,220
And these signals will actually produce satiety. So you're no longer hungry or you'll continue to consume food,

68
00:10:31,520 --> 00:10:37,460
depending on the sensitivity that your central nervous system has to these different signals.

69
00:10:38,180 --> 00:10:46,370
And that sensitivity can be regulated by many things, including the rewarding characteristics of a food.

70
00:10:47,330 --> 00:10:56,810
You may not need the energy from the food that you're consuming, yet that food has a certain rewarding characteristic to it,

71
00:10:57,260 --> 00:11:00,230
and you might consume it even though you don't need the calories.

72
00:11:01,070 --> 00:11:14,300
Kitty, you had a question so the two glycogen stores in your liver would be in to or in long term, that would be more long term.

73
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:19,220
So here. So I'm sorry. Short term. So it's your.

74
00:11:20,370 --> 00:11:25,830
The nutrient layered signal has to do with the level of blood glucose that's referred to in this particular figure.

75
00:11:26,310 --> 00:11:31,800
So because glycogen can break down pretty easily through glucose.

76
00:11:32,100 --> 00:11:38,690
Yes. Yeah. So this is just the overworld.

77
00:11:38,690 --> 00:11:44,960
We're going to walk through this. So let's first talk about the long term storage.

78
00:11:46,010 --> 00:11:50,510
Hormones are indicators of of long term energy storage, the first being leptin.

79
00:11:50,930 --> 00:11:58,850
And I've been telling you all along that leptin correlated linearly correlated with the total amount of adipose tissue that you have.

80
00:11:59,510 --> 00:12:11,210
So this was from a study from 96 and they're looking at their body fat percentage on the x axis and total sphere of leptin and the y axis.

81
00:12:11,810 --> 00:12:15,790
And you can see as the body fat percentage increases, there's more left in.

82
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:19,790
And then this inset is essentially another way to look at the data.

83
00:12:19,880 --> 00:12:28,100
They're looking at the log of this leptin versus the body fat percentage after the paper then.

84
00:12:28,280 --> 00:12:35,420
So this this is the proof that, yes, you've got leptin and it's it's correlated with at a paucity.

85
00:12:36,440 --> 00:12:48,050
If you don't have the ability again to produce a functional Lexus and a mouse, you would see a mouse like this that they always feels hungry.

86
00:12:49,370 --> 00:12:57,319
So that signal coming in from left hand is really important and it won't ever feel say that you get

87
00:12:57,320 --> 00:13:01,910
some mechanical stretch of the McCann receptors that kind of inhibit feeding for a little while.

88
00:13:01,910 --> 00:13:05,150
But very shortly after that, they're still hungry.

89
00:13:05,300 --> 00:13:13,010
And then the human curves that human to human host efficiency and leptin and this is

90
00:13:13,010 --> 00:13:19,100
the same child after they've been treated with leptin for a long period of time.

91
00:13:20,150 --> 00:13:24,050
Proving that left is really important for regulating appetite.

92
00:13:25,100 --> 00:13:34,490
So in the case of leptin deficiency, there's an early onset of obesity there in this perceived state of starvation,

93
00:13:34,760 --> 00:13:39,770
and they eat constantly as a consequence and they have leptin.

94
00:13:39,770 --> 00:13:48,830
There's a lot of other things, so there's a lot of other abnormalities associated with having been deficiency or a leptin receptor deficiency.

95
00:13:49,370 --> 00:13:52,400
This is a rare again condition,

96
00:13:53,090 --> 00:14:05,840
but what's more common is people who have polymorphisms in either leptin or the leptin receptor and talk a little bit about that.

97
00:14:05,840 --> 00:14:16,790
All right. So the next figure comes from a paper that's referred to in the background reading that you have with reference 21.

98
00:14:17,030 --> 00:14:24,650
And back in 1967, there was this report looking at fasting serum insulin with body weight.

99
00:14:25,130 --> 00:14:33,120
Now, in 1967, the use of BMI was a typical indicator of body size.

100
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:37,550
So there's looking here at a percent of ideal body weight.

101
00:14:38,360 --> 00:14:42,890
So that's how the data is expressed because that's how they did back in this particular time.

102
00:14:43,890 --> 00:14:53,640
The point of this is to show you that you have here on the Y axis insulin and they say amino acid, reactive insulin.

103
00:14:54,120 --> 00:15:01,350
And they're looking at here how it's linearly related to, in this case, ideal body weight.

104
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:10,410
And so as you go up this curve, or I should say, as you increase in body weight, you increase the amount of adipose tissue.

105
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:14,460
And this shows you this relationship.

106
00:15:14,670 --> 00:15:18,180
So more adipose tissue, more insulin.

107
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:25,410
And there are many, many other studies in humans and in mice that have shown this type of relationship.

108
00:15:26,100 --> 00:15:36,180
This is probably one of the reasons. So insulin produced by the pancreas in response to glucose levels.

109
00:15:38,100 --> 00:15:43,710
Um and peripheral in the periphery. And it increases without a paucity, as I showed you.

110
00:15:44,340 --> 00:15:48,330
And then, um, in regard to the central nervous system,

111
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:59,190
not only does it play an important role in getting your muscle to take up glucose, but it plays a role in regulating appetite.

112
00:16:00,210 --> 00:16:08,340
So in the central nervous system, it can activate those profile of neurons, the passing neurons.

113
00:16:09,240 --> 00:16:18,030
And this reduces food intake and it inhibits the neurons that produce mp y that stimulate appetite.

114
00:16:20,130 --> 00:16:31,950
And then so it inhibits appetite, you get the alpha and that and that activates this inhibitory response that produces satiety,

115
00:16:32,460 --> 00:16:36,910
but its effects are much less potent than that. I.

116
00:16:44,370 --> 00:16:53,610
So this is an overview of the different signals coming in from adipose tissue, from the gastrointestinal tract.

117
00:16:54,300 --> 00:17:04,290
And, and, and it shows you the centers of the brain that can monitor peripheral energy stored.

118
00:17:04,290 --> 00:17:10,260
So you have the nucleus of the hypothalamus here and then you have the.

119
00:17:10,530 --> 00:17:15,680
Yes, the nucleus of the track, the solitary.

120
00:17:16,110 --> 00:17:23,220
It's in the brainstem. And in response to the amount of adipose tissue you have and how much,

121
00:17:24,030 --> 00:17:35,220
if you've just taken the meal responses from the GI tract travel to the brainstem through the vagus nerve to affect your perception of satiety.

122
00:17:36,030 --> 00:17:43,919
So leptin can uh, there are leptin receptors and two sets or three sets.

123
00:17:43,920 --> 00:17:48,120
Actually, this is just showing two sets of neurons within the acute nucleus.

124
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:55,980
You have the neurons that produce policy and then you have neurons that produce HAARP.

125
00:17:56,400 --> 00:18:04,080
Okay, so leptin is going to stimulate the passing neurons to produce policy and they these

126
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:09,210
projects second order centers in the brain a pair of ventricular nuclei here.

127
00:18:10,420 --> 00:18:20,350
And they also left. It can also inhibit the ability of the HAARP neurons to make ability related peptide to neuropeptide y.

128
00:18:22,090 --> 00:18:29,210
So it's both inhibiting appetite, um, here and, and um,

129
00:18:29,920 --> 00:18:38,080
two different mechanisms for producing policy and it's inhibiting the production of neuropeptides that stimulate appetite.

130
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:46,120
Now in the brain stem. The brain stem is responding to what's going on in the gut.

131
00:18:47,260 --> 00:18:55,629
And that hormone that they mentioned here is closest to kind of the closest to kind of is

132
00:18:55,630 --> 00:19:03,310
released in the small intestine in response to metabolized macronutrients fatty acids,

133
00:19:03,650 --> 00:19:04,660
as an example.

134
00:19:05,080 --> 00:19:14,530
And as that concentration of metabolize macronutrients increases, c, c, k increases, it circulates in the blood, it reaches the brain stem.

135
00:19:14,980 --> 00:19:19,330
And it can also have its effect by reducing.

136
00:19:23,070 --> 00:19:28,920
The other thing that you should know is that these regions of the brain, the brain stem,

137
00:19:28,920 --> 00:19:36,980
it's in the nucleus of ventricular nuclei and other regions of the brain are in contact with another.

138
00:19:36,990 --> 00:19:43,620
They're connected by these neuro projections that release neurotransmitters that affect their activity.

139
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:49,190
So there's a lot of cross-talk going on between these different centers.

140
00:19:52,690 --> 00:20:03,700
So let's let's break this down. You have satiety signals that are anorexic, so they inhibit and anorexia genic.

141
00:20:03,700 --> 00:20:10,510
So they inhibit appetite and they caused you to stop eating a Internet of things.

142
00:20:13,150 --> 00:20:19,720
So another peripheral hormone is glucagon like peptide or GLP one.

143
00:20:21,070 --> 00:20:27,940
We'll talk a lot more detail about this one later. It's closest to content that I just mentioned.

144
00:20:30,120 --> 00:20:35,010
I've got to take my wine and there's pro-inflammatory cytokines.

145
00:20:35,470 --> 00:20:37,710
So these are coming from the gut.

146
00:20:38,460 --> 00:20:48,780
After you've ingested a meal, the pro-inflammatory cytokines are increasing in response to something like illness or an infection or trauma.

147
00:20:49,630 --> 00:20:52,920
What air released in the blood and circulating.

148
00:20:52,920 --> 00:20:56,820
When they reach the brain, they have the same effect of inhibiting appetite.

149
00:20:57,810 --> 00:21:05,160
So it's thought that these signals are important because if you're injured or if you have an illness,

150
00:21:05,160 --> 00:21:16,680
you want to conserve your energy and not go out, seek food, or it reduces food seeking behavior and this conserves energy.

151
00:21:19,170 --> 00:21:25,800
Then you have increases in glucose and free fatty acids that can terminate feeding as well.

152
00:21:27,620 --> 00:21:30,889
Okay. So these are the satiety signals. They're anorexia genic.

153
00:21:30,890 --> 00:21:34,720
They terminate feeding. More about these in detail.

154
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:42,200
I want to say you're rex genic signals stimulate.

155
00:21:42,950 --> 00:21:51,169
Okay. And the hormone that best studies are best known to do this is grillot there are there are others that are less well known,

156
00:21:51,170 --> 00:22:06,920
but ghrelin is the primary one. This is a hormone that's produced in your stomach that increases as your nutrient levels decline.

157
00:22:08,090 --> 00:22:17,000
So when you wake up in the morning, your ghrelin levels are elevated in between meals before you eat, your ghrelin levels are elevated.

158
00:22:17,750 --> 00:22:32,190
And this gives you the sensation of hunger. So these pathways are integrated.

159
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:38,430
So here, here's the output nucleus again, and then here's the ends.

160
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:44,440
And then here's the pair of ventricular nuclei. This is the second order of neurons.

161
00:22:44,490 --> 00:22:55,080
And again, there's there's connections between these centers in the brain that regulate appetite and even energy expenditure, appetite and satiety.

162
00:22:56,600 --> 00:23:03,380
So leptin is actually complex in terms of hunger.

163
00:23:03,620 --> 00:23:06,260
I told you that in the absence of leptin,

164
00:23:06,500 --> 00:23:13,370
you're always going to be hungry and you have a voracious appetite and you're always for like you're starving.

165
00:23:13,880 --> 00:23:17,240
Well, that's because it does a number of things.

166
00:23:17,510 --> 00:23:31,250
It has a number of cells now that express receptors for left, and that can affect the second order neurons and it can affect appetite and satiety.

167
00:23:32,500 --> 00:23:36,430
So here's the different cell types and different shades of purple.

168
00:23:38,200 --> 00:23:43,329
You have neuronal synthase and ketamine.

169
00:23:43,330 --> 00:23:54,110
If you're beta gas, it neurons. And when leptin binds to the legend receptor in these cells, these neurotransmitters are inhibitory.

170
00:23:54,130 --> 00:24:01,390
They inhibit appetite. And this is the receptor expressed in this particular center in the brain, the pair of ventricular nuclei.

171
00:24:02,950 --> 00:24:06,760
That's one another way that leptin can inhibit appetite.

172
00:24:08,200 --> 00:24:18,549
Leptin now is in this particular scenario, it's stimulating the leptin receptor and it's stimulating the promising neurons in the pump.

173
00:24:18,550 --> 00:24:23,260
See, neurons are releasing powerful message and that's going to inhibit appetite.

174
00:24:23,980 --> 00:24:28,450
And a third way in which leptin can suppress appetite,

175
00:24:28,450 --> 00:24:36,040
but that it actually blocks the ability of these other neurons to the neurons that they're labeling here, HAARP.

176
00:24:36,340 --> 00:24:39,880
You'll see that HRP is neuropeptide Y.

177
00:24:39,940 --> 00:24:44,200
These are the ones that make you hungry. It inhibits their activity.

178
00:24:44,200 --> 00:24:52,830
So there's less firing of those neurons and there's less of the activation of the receptors within the pair of ventricular nuclei.

179
00:24:53,350 --> 00:24:57,610
Okay. Leptin shares ghrelin.

180
00:24:57,610 --> 00:25:00,880
Here's the hunger hormone that's produced by your stomach.

181
00:25:01,720 --> 00:25:08,380
It's finding to this receptor and the pain eros, and you don't have this receptor in the other sets of neurons.

182
00:25:09,470 --> 00:25:14,920
And it's stimulating the neurons and they're releasing neuropeptides.

183
00:25:14,930 --> 00:25:21,260
Neuropeptide Y agouti related peptide. And they're making you have that perception of being hungry.

184
00:25:23,180 --> 00:25:37,100
And they can actually inhibit the neurons and their firing and producing probably a lot of this long peptide.

185
00:25:38,450 --> 00:25:46,580
So this is this inhibitory signal is also complex in regard to how it affects the other neurons in your.

186
00:25:47,870 --> 00:25:52,070
So these events aren't occurring and in isolation.

187
00:25:53,210 --> 00:25:59,870
They're also going to be affecting what's going on in the city centers and the NTSB.

188
00:26:01,010 --> 00:26:06,500
So within the NTSB, again, it's receiving information about what's going on in the gut.

189
00:26:07,280 --> 00:26:25,280
And the vagus nerve is has connections to the A.S. And your perception of satiety or being hungry is affected by what's going on up here.

190
00:26:25,910 --> 00:26:39,140
What do I mean by that? So if you have high levels of leptin and you're receiving input from the gut in terms of C, C, K,

191
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:48,200
your the sensitivity to that signal may increase or decrease depending on how much left that you have circulating.

192
00:26:48,920 --> 00:27:01,970
So if you have low circulating levels of left and this might indicate your need for energy and as a consequence the more sensitive to the K signaling.

193
00:27:03,290 --> 00:27:09,109
C.K. is going to have a more potent influence on informing the brain that, you know,

194
00:27:09,110 --> 00:27:16,700
there's there's there's energy here, and it's going to affect the size of the meal that they're going to take up.

195
00:27:16,710 --> 00:27:22,430
So policies, the contain effects, and that's the time in which you consume a particular meal.

196
00:27:24,320 --> 00:27:32,990
So in these projections from the term interstellar nuclei to the entity, yes, it can affect the size.

197
00:27:36,200 --> 00:27:40,190
Yeah. As you age, does that decrease? No.

198
00:27:40,380 --> 00:27:49,910
You know, that's a that's a really good question. Especially if you are older than 65 or 70, something like that.

199
00:27:49,920 --> 00:27:54,770
Do those signals break down? Because, you know, at Christmas time, they essentially threw a lot of money?

200
00:27:56,210 --> 00:28:06,650
No, no, that's a really good question. So let's walk through these interactions.

201
00:28:06,980 --> 00:28:12,830
And here I have the same figure that's highlighted in just the left.

202
00:28:12,830 --> 00:28:17,120
And so neuropeptide Y and ERP neurons.

203
00:28:20,150 --> 00:28:27,500
So neuropeptide Y is produced by these neurons and their cell bodies are in the activity nucleus.

204
00:28:28,660 --> 00:28:32,500
And they produce these two neuropeptides drug peptide.

205
00:28:32,500 --> 00:28:43,000
Why would you related peptide it stimulates a pair of ventricular nuclei and they also affect the lateral hypothalamus as well.

206
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:47,320
And I'll include that in the next set of slides.

207
00:28:50,560 --> 00:28:56,860
The Neuropeptide Y. Is your opinion on respond to a negative energy balance.

208
00:28:57,820 --> 00:29:05,830
So it's it's these cells are being stimulated from they're responding to low levels of

209
00:29:05,830 --> 00:29:15,670
growing on sorry high levels of urine an indication of it's time to eat appetite increases.

210
00:29:21,610 --> 00:29:32,020
Okay. So Revlon is a peptide that's produced in the stomach and it reaches this neutralize through the blood.

211
00:29:34,030 --> 00:29:40,960
So it increases during fasting and it rapidly declines after a meal.

212
00:29:40,990 --> 00:29:44,410
And I'll discussed in more detail how that happens.

213
00:29:44,770 --> 00:29:49,690
On Wednesday. So blood reaches the hypothalamus.

214
00:29:49,870 --> 00:29:57,040
It stimulates feeding. It can also act on the pituitary to stimulate growth.

215
00:29:57,310 --> 00:30:06,400
The release of growth hormone and its receptors are here in the Arctic nuclei.

216
00:30:06,700 --> 00:30:10,480
As far as I know, there's a receptors for krill and aren't expressed anywhere else.

217
00:30:13,960 --> 00:30:17,680
And the net effect is to increase their peptide by an age group.

218
00:30:17,690 --> 00:30:26,100
She. And then you have a set of neurons now that inhibit appetite.

219
00:30:27,060 --> 00:30:37,260
So you have this a neuronal nitric oxide synthase, and you have amino butyric acid neurons which are like the Gavin neurons.

220
00:30:37,560 --> 00:30:49,110
These are inhibitory signals. So these cells produce these neuropeptides and then they reach the ventricular nucleus and they inhibit appetite.

221
00:30:55,540 --> 00:31:01,900
Another set of neurons that I mentioned was the palm. See, and here I'm introducing the cartoon neurons.

222
00:31:02,500 --> 00:31:14,319
In the diagram they just refer to policy. The little Mylanta carton is a peptide that's broken down and it's actually the output

223
00:31:14,320 --> 00:31:20,650
melanocytes stimulating hormone or alpha MSH that has the effect of inhibiting appetite.

224
00:31:24,120 --> 00:31:28,350
And it's it inhibits appetite. So it's anorexic genic.

225
00:31:30,070 --> 00:31:37,090
And the cart you'll see in other figures and mentioned in other publications what this is.

226
00:31:37,090 --> 00:31:40,330
It's a cocaine amphetamine. Related Transcript.

227
00:31:41,110 --> 00:31:46,960
So in response to this type of stimuli, um, it can also inhibit appetite.

228
00:31:47,950 --> 00:31:51,880
So this transcript that's produced in response to after that,

229
00:31:52,300 --> 00:32:00,390
this particular group of cells says these drugs can inhibit appetite through the similar neural pathways.

230
00:32:02,830 --> 00:32:10,420
All right, so I've been talking about policy a lot, and I've not shown you what this molecule looks like and what it does.

231
00:32:11,380 --> 00:32:16,810
So it's essentially a short peptide,

232
00:32:17,380 --> 00:32:28,510
and here's the structure of the peptides and how it's metabolized and broken down into the line of sight, stimulating hormones.

233
00:32:28,510 --> 00:32:32,800
And you have different kinds. Alpha MSH is the primary one.

234
00:32:36,050 --> 00:32:46,010
You also get to control the hormone from this particular peptide and then you get some other peptides from this as well.

235
00:32:47,090 --> 00:32:50,270
You have four different Mylanta receptors.

236
00:32:50,570 --> 00:32:56,900
The most important one that I want you to remember for this class, for these purposes, is this one namesake for our.

237
00:32:58,100 --> 00:33:07,970
And it binds to the line of thought and stimulating hormone, affecting energy homeostasis, inhibiting appetite.

238
00:33:09,110 --> 00:33:13,670
And then here's another mention here of HRP inhibiting this interaction.

239
00:33:14,600 --> 00:33:18,440
And then you have other receptors that do different things.

240
00:33:18,830 --> 00:33:24,710
But for the purpose of this class, I want you to remember remember the MSI for our receptor.

241
00:33:25,800 --> 00:33:27,360
NC three are is important too,

242
00:33:27,360 --> 00:33:36,390
but for the most part this is the receptor that's of greatest the greatest importance in terms of inhibiting appetite in the brain.

243
00:33:40,950 --> 00:33:47,580
So if you lack the pharmacy, you have a voracious appetite.

244
00:33:49,170 --> 00:33:53,490
It also affects a hair color. So the mouse has red hair.

245
00:33:53,680 --> 00:33:57,060
The child who has a policy deficiency has red hair.

246
00:33:57,630 --> 00:34:01,980
It's an early onset of obesity in this case and in the child.

247
00:34:03,150 --> 00:34:09,030
And it occurs as a consequence of not being able to form that alpha MSH.

248
00:34:11,110 --> 00:34:13,140
And we talked a little bit about that before.

249
00:34:13,600 --> 00:34:24,100
And then if you can give there's a drug now, too, that can be given to people who have this deficiency set in Atlanta tied,

250
00:34:24,760 --> 00:34:29,200
and it can provide that inhibitory signal to inhibit appetite.

251
00:34:29,590 --> 00:34:41,499
And as I mentioned in a previous lecture, you also need to give them dexamethasone or a of particleboard to prevent the adrenal insufficiency,

252
00:34:41,500 --> 00:34:51,130
because you need that policy to make the hormones and activate that the pituitary adrenal gland as well.

253
00:34:51,960 --> 00:35:01,120
Now, you had a question on the website. So is the AP, are those like allosteric inhibitors of alpha?

254
00:35:01,210 --> 00:35:06,850
And you say, oh, I see what you're saying here. Yeah, exactly.

255
00:35:06,970 --> 00:35:22,980
The mechanism, how this works, I don't know. So we have two different, I should say,

256
00:35:23,140 --> 00:35:34,320
the systems that control appetite under that homeostatic and hedonic systems that are described in the literature.

257
00:35:35,740 --> 00:35:41,260
The homeostatic system refers to energy, the need for energy.

258
00:35:41,650 --> 00:35:47,880
So you're responding to under cues because you don't have enough energy.

259
00:35:47,890 --> 00:35:48,610
You're hungry.

260
00:35:48,910 --> 00:36:01,120
It's 11:00 in the morning and you're starting to get hungry and you're getting hungry because the energy substrates are going to decline.

261
00:36:01,570 --> 00:36:07,510
And that makes you hungry less enables decline less rapidly, but they do.

262
00:36:08,710 --> 00:36:14,800
You can actually lower your leptin levels to undetectable if you've worked too fast for 36 hours.

263
00:36:15,310 --> 00:36:22,090
So that's another signal that declines, but not as fast as something like glucose.

264
00:36:22,780 --> 00:36:32,080
And there's in concert with that, there's this hedonic system that has to do with food reward.

265
00:36:32,350 --> 00:36:40,659
And this has a strong influence on food intake and they had Adonis centers in the

266
00:36:40,660 --> 00:36:48,700
brain are going to be responding to the rewarding qualities of a particular food.

267
00:36:49,690 --> 00:36:56,680
Okay. So that's part of this system that regulates food intake.

268
00:36:58,090 --> 00:37:01,690
So here is the diagram again.

269
00:37:01,900 --> 00:37:09,340
And in this case, it's showing you the chocolate nucleus interacting with the lateral hypothalamus.

270
00:37:09,340 --> 00:37:13,030
And then the lateral hypothalamus is integrating all of this information.

271
00:37:13,930 --> 00:37:17,410
And it has projections here to the ventral striatum.

272
00:37:18,250 --> 00:37:26,900
And within the ventral striatum, you have the ventral segmental area that can relay this information to the nucleus accumbens.

273
00:37:26,920 --> 00:37:31,720
This is the center of the brain that can process this rewarding stimuli.

274
00:37:32,730 --> 00:37:38,050
Okay. And this can affect your appetite as well.

275
00:37:38,830 --> 00:37:45,969
So if you're in the presence of a highly palatable food, you may still consume that food,

276
00:37:45,970 --> 00:37:52,230
even though from an energetic perspective, you might not need to take that that particular food.

277
00:37:52,690 --> 00:38:02,050
So highly palatable food can override signals that produce satiety, causing you to consume more calories than you need.

278
00:38:04,040 --> 00:38:13,610
And then in addition to the leptin signal, the ghrelin can also influence these interactions as well.

279
00:38:16,240 --> 00:38:21,280
So let's talk a little bit about food reward. This has to do with the POW ability of food.

280
00:38:22,750 --> 00:38:27,220
It's been described as the non homeostatic feeding signal.

281
00:38:27,610 --> 00:38:35,080
Um, it, uh, and the paper describes how that might not be the best way to describe this system.

282
00:38:36,310 --> 00:38:41,620
It's affected. It affects the rewarding. It's affected by the rewarding properties of food.

283
00:38:42,750 --> 00:38:50,200
Um, so you can have sufficient energy storage or satiety after a meal,

284
00:38:50,200 --> 00:38:55,540
but you might continue to consume a particular food item because it really tastes so good.

285
00:38:57,370 --> 00:39:02,710
So when you are consuming a particular food, um,

286
00:39:03,010 --> 00:39:10,570
you may eat more or you may eat less depending on your perception of the rewarding qualities of that particular food.

287
00:39:11,770 --> 00:39:15,010
And this is going to change while you're eating that food.

288
00:39:15,640 --> 00:39:25,630
So, um, let's say you're eating, um, a large dessert item and it looks really good and you're consuming it.

289
00:39:25,990 --> 00:39:36,880
And as you're consuming it, um, that the glucose and the lipids within that particular item that you're consuming, increasing your blood.

290
00:39:37,150 --> 00:39:40,720
You get some stretch of the mechanical canto receptors in your gut,

291
00:39:41,260 --> 00:39:49,030
and this changes your perception of the rewarding qualities of that particular food, making you less willing to consume it.

292
00:39:50,290 --> 00:40:01,270
So in that way, this, um, pedantic or not homeostatic system is working in regulating how much food you're going to take in.

293
00:40:03,570 --> 00:40:10,270
Um. So. In regard to the rewarding quality of food.

294
00:40:10,540 --> 00:40:19,870
If you have a condition in which somebody had lost weight after fasting, the signal for leptin goes down.

295
00:40:20,290 --> 00:40:23,319
And then if you were to give you highly palatable food,

296
00:40:23,320 --> 00:40:36,430
it would look more desirable because the signal from leptin has declined and you would be more likely to consume a larger portion of a particular,

297
00:40:36,430 --> 00:40:41,050
highly palatable food. As a consequence of this signal being released as well.

298
00:40:41,500 --> 00:40:51,700
So these interactions are regulated or integrated in your brain, and these relationships are complex.

299
00:40:55,510 --> 00:41:01,000
So let's take a look at the hedonic value of food by just looking at these things.

300
00:41:01,900 --> 00:41:05,380
It's hard to describe them unless you experience them.

301
00:41:05,440 --> 00:41:07,750
So there's the visual appeal and there's the flavor.

302
00:41:08,590 --> 00:41:17,560
So right now, all of you nutrition students, your brains are freaking out because you're seeing food at great nutritional quality.

303
00:41:18,460 --> 00:41:22,510
So you're saying, Oh, wow, this is great. I want to eat that. That looks really good.

304
00:41:22,570 --> 00:41:27,550
I'm hungry now. I want to eat more lettuce than now.

305
00:41:27,560 --> 00:41:36,130
Okay. But if you were to see something like this image, right, you respond to that because you know, you're familiar with that food, right?

306
00:41:36,730 --> 00:41:42,700
You know what's in that cake? There's sugar, which will give you elevated levels of glucose.

307
00:41:42,700 --> 00:41:47,160
Right. And, you know, there's lipids that also will give you energy.

308
00:41:47,170 --> 00:41:52,899
So your brain responds to that and will seek out that kind of food because it's energy dense.

309
00:41:52,900 --> 00:41:59,670
Right. And it's going to have an effect on the reward and reward centers in your brain.

310
00:41:59,680 --> 00:42:05,500
It's going to make you feel good as you're eating it so you're attracted to that kind of food.

311
00:42:06,410 --> 00:42:09,500
And if you're presented with a bunch of different food options,

312
00:42:09,830 --> 00:42:17,950
you're more likely to choose foods with high hedonic value then of lower hedonic value such as this one.

313
00:42:17,960 --> 00:42:23,600
But your nutrition students say you don't respond to that chocolate cake, but anyway, you get the point.

314
00:42:23,960 --> 00:42:31,790
So the hedonic value of food can override signals that tell you to stop eating.

315
00:42:31,790 --> 00:42:38,180
And because the pleasantness of the food has this effect on the rewarding centers of your brain,

316
00:42:38,540 --> 00:42:44,090
you're more likely to consume more of it and choose these types of food over other types of foods,

317
00:42:44,480 --> 00:42:49,790
even though you're well-educated and you know that the nutritional value of different types of foods.

318
00:42:50,910 --> 00:42:55,010
Yeah. So when I look at the first picture of my mice, this is a great idea.

319
00:42:55,430 --> 00:43:01,950
But when you show the second picture, most of us move. Yeah, but isn't this level also controlled by the brain?

320
00:43:02,150 --> 00:43:07,570
Yes, sure. You're preparing your body to ingest a highly palatable food.

321
00:43:07,580 --> 00:43:15,889
Yeah. Yes. So in terms of the hedonic system,

322
00:43:15,890 --> 00:43:26,600
here is here's some areas in the brain that are known to respond to the value of the rewarding qualities of the food.

323
00:43:27,320 --> 00:43:39,110
So these areas, if you were to look at this blood circulating through different regions of the brain, you'd notice that these areas might light up.

324
00:43:39,920 --> 00:43:43,820
So you have areas within the frontal cortex, the orbitofrontal cortex,

325
00:43:44,300 --> 00:43:49,670
you have the dorsal striatum, the insula, you have the amygdala, the nucleus accumbens.

326
00:43:49,700 --> 00:43:56,000
All of these areas may, may show greater activity in a response to rewarding food.

327
00:43:56,650 --> 00:44:09,260
Now you've got other areas also within the lateral hypothalamus, a mental area and substantia nigra and then not shown.

328
00:44:09,260 --> 00:44:15,770
Here you can have areas within the occipital lobe light up as well, indicating that your brain,

329
00:44:16,430 --> 00:44:25,760
the activity in your brain, responds to visual cues in the form of the rewarding qualities of a particular food.

330
00:44:27,920 --> 00:44:36,470
So an example of this were some classic studies done here that were published in 2007.

331
00:44:37,620 --> 00:44:41,470
In this particular paper,

332
00:44:41,750 --> 00:44:55,400
you're looking at a human brain and you have here areas that have been mapped based on the flow characteristics or the activity in the brain.

333
00:44:55,670 --> 00:45:00,800
So these are areas in the brain that light up in response to different kinds of cue.

334
00:45:00,830 --> 00:45:06,830
So this is neuronal activation in response to visual stimuli as foods of high

335
00:45:06,830 --> 00:45:13,310
sonic value compared with foods of neutral hedonic value and a new caloric state.

336
00:45:13,550 --> 00:45:14,480
So what does that mean?

337
00:45:15,020 --> 00:45:24,020
So this is an individual who's having a brain scan done and they're looking at the neuronal activity and they're not in the hunger.

338
00:45:24,030 --> 00:45:28,410
They're not hungry and they're not sated. It's not after a meal there.

339
00:45:28,730 --> 00:45:34,280
They're just a neutral in terms of their need to take in food.

340
00:45:35,840 --> 00:45:39,079
So you have the very visual cortex that's lighting up.

341
00:45:39,080 --> 00:45:44,300
So there's a lot of activity in here when you're looking at foods with a high hedonic value

342
00:45:45,590 --> 00:45:51,920
that areas within the hypothalamus are lighting up and the motor cortex is lighting up as well.

343
00:45:53,180 --> 00:45:55,970
So this is the percent signal change.

344
00:45:56,690 --> 00:46:05,540
So you're comparing in this graph of you're looking at this response to visual stimuli of foods with high economic value compared to,

345
00:46:05,540 --> 00:46:07,640
for instance, a neutral exotic value.

346
00:46:08,420 --> 00:46:17,750
And you're getting greater activity in these regions of the brain, the hypothalamus and the inferior visual cortex in response to these images.

347
00:46:19,190 --> 00:46:31,070
Okay. Now, if you were to take the same individual and give them a meal, it's going to change that perception of that that meal,

348
00:46:31,160 --> 00:46:36,110
and it's going to affect the activity in these areas in the brain like this.

349
00:46:37,320 --> 00:46:46,380
So here is an individual of the brain scan of an individual who has consumed more calories than they need, so they're overfed.

350
00:46:47,850 --> 00:46:55,410
So this is the neural response to stimulate economic value compared with rates of neutral, the same type of scenario.

351
00:46:56,760 --> 00:47:01,050
Yet you see much less activity here in the different regions of the brain.

352
00:47:01,170 --> 00:47:13,230
And I showed you that we're lit up. Okay, so here's the your caloric state, the signal change, and here's the overfed state so that the.

353
00:47:15,400 --> 00:47:21,100
Characteristics of the food are much less desirable after you've had a meal,

354
00:47:21,100 --> 00:47:32,980
and if you overeat and it shuts down the activity in the centers of the brain that affect this idiotic response that the food consumption.

355
00:47:34,120 --> 00:47:49,590
Okay. So in regard to food abroad, we're talking about non-tech value and the motivation to work and for food and to consume that food.

356
00:47:50,430 --> 00:47:57,420
And it's this as Olympic dopaminergic neurons here in the ventral segmental area that we're talking about.

357
00:47:58,200 --> 00:48:03,720
So here is that the nucleus accumbens that I showed you a picture of previously.

358
00:48:04,110 --> 00:48:09,150
And these are our areas that are responding to food reward.

359
00:48:12,680 --> 00:48:15,680
And then you have the lateral hypothalamus.

360
00:48:15,680 --> 00:48:19,840
So neurons in the lateral hypothalamic area integrate reward related input.

361
00:48:20,740 --> 00:48:32,020
So there is cross-talk between the accurate nucleus and the lateral hypothalamic area and the nucleus accumbens and the ventral segmental area.

362
00:48:32,980 --> 00:48:44,320
So these circuits interact with one another and they can respond to foods of high dynamic value.

363
00:48:44,500 --> 00:48:47,890
There's this increased sense of timing.

364
00:48:48,820 --> 00:48:52,120
These signals can ultimately inhibit appetite.

365
00:48:53,020 --> 00:49:00,249
Or if there's low leptin and there's elevated ghrelin, uh, these signals will be more responsible,

366
00:49:00,250 --> 00:49:06,430
or these centers will be more responsive to things like ghrelin and foods of high hedonic value.

367
00:49:10,410 --> 00:49:14,130
So it's not just the need for energy that drives food intake.

368
00:49:14,640 --> 00:49:18,300
It's that hedonic or rewarding properties of a particular.

369
00:49:20,760 --> 00:49:28,000
Do you think someone people with like visual impairments would have a similar response or like other senses would be more sensitive?

370
00:49:28,020 --> 00:49:32,350
I would think their sense of smell might increase perhaps, and it's age dependent.

371
00:49:32,370 --> 00:49:36,810
They think there might be some compensation here. But that's a really, really interesting question.

372
00:49:38,040 --> 00:49:45,059
What about people who have no vision so they are who have never had vision?

373
00:49:45,060 --> 00:49:49,590
You know, they would be much more responsive to the odor and the taste of a particular.

374
00:49:56,700 --> 00:50:08,190
Okay. So that's that's how this idiotic system, they're warning properties of foods are integrated with these homeostatic systems.

375
00:50:08,350 --> 00:50:19,390
How they have influence, we should take. Now let's look at, um, responses to acute changes and, and energy in this example.

376
00:50:19,750 --> 00:50:28,180
This overview refers to what would happen if you had somebody who hasn't eaten in a while and their blood sugar levels drop.

377
00:50:29,210 --> 00:50:32,590
Okay, so here's the big picture.

378
00:50:33,100 --> 00:50:36,400
You have the players that are responding to this.

379
00:50:36,850 --> 00:50:46,480
The deficiency in available starch fuels the pancreas, the adipose tissue and the liver, and their signaling is down.

380
00:50:47,350 --> 00:50:56,920
And this affects the brain and different in many different ways, and it affects a higher sentence as a brain that ultimately affects reproduction.

381
00:50:57,790 --> 00:51:08,860
It effects feeding, as we've discussed. It can affect thermogenesis and it can affect the other pathways.

382
00:51:10,180 --> 00:51:15,820
And the brain can respond because, again, glucose is the preferred energy substrate of the brain.

383
00:51:16,030 --> 00:51:26,650
It can respond by releasing other hormones and activating responses that can raise blood glucose levels to normal.

384
00:51:27,310 --> 00:51:33,040
And it does this through hypothalamic pituitary axis, increasing corticosterone.

385
00:51:33,550 --> 00:51:42,660
It does this by increasing glucagon levels of actually release the pancreas and this would increase glucose output.

386
00:51:44,290 --> 00:51:53,500
Okay, let's break this down. So let's just look at insulin levels decline because blood glucose levels are low.

387
00:51:54,540 --> 00:51:57,720
Um, left in levels declined.

388
00:51:58,260 --> 00:52:11,970
Um, and as I said, I think you go without a meal 4 hours a day, a day and a half, but the levels can decline enough to where you would notice.

389
00:52:12,540 --> 00:52:21,720
And that would be a signal that, hey, peripheral energy stores are down, telling the brain, perhaps it's time to eat.

390
00:52:21,990 --> 00:52:28,200
And in this case, if there's no food available, the brain will respond by shutting down other activities.

391
00:52:29,160 --> 00:52:35,760
And then you have reduced glucose levels that are less circulating like food.

392
00:52:38,220 --> 00:52:41,340
So there's reduced, um, storage of energy.

393
00:52:41,340 --> 00:52:43,170
This is how the brain perceives this.

394
00:52:44,200 --> 00:52:54,370
We have less energy stores and there needs to be a mechanism that can conserve energy stores and the mechanisms are listed here.

395
00:52:55,330 --> 00:53:03,760
So the brain response to this low energy state, by reducing things that are energy expensive,

396
00:53:04,360 --> 00:53:11,410
so the brain conserves energy by inhibiting energy expensive processes like growth.

397
00:53:12,340 --> 00:53:17,170
So the the ability of the cell, the brain.

398
00:53:17,320 --> 00:53:23,860
Now, what it does is that it suppresses the hypothalamus, pituitary thyroid access.

399
00:53:23,860 --> 00:53:28,120
So it reduces the thyroid hormone reducing thermogenesis.

400
00:53:29,800 --> 00:53:35,350
It increases the need for this sensation of hunger.

401
00:53:36,460 --> 00:53:46,420
So there's an increased motivation here to eat, and it reduces the ability of this individual.

402
00:53:46,420 --> 00:53:52,000
If this is a prolonged reduction in energy stores, it reduces their ability to reproduce.

403
00:53:53,560 --> 00:54:02,620
So how does it do that? Well, a pathway that has been defined for this is lessened.

404
00:54:02,620 --> 00:54:05,250
So the leptin levels are low.

405
00:54:06,250 --> 00:54:17,620
Your ability to produce gonadotropin releasing hormones declines and the gonadotropin releasing hormone is critical for reproductive status.

406
00:54:18,580 --> 00:54:28,300
So when you restore leptin levels, gonadotropin releasing control is elevated again in this reproductive capacity increases.

407
00:54:28,870 --> 00:54:34,810
And then so these are our mechanisms to conserve energy.

408
00:54:36,340 --> 00:54:45,250
The less energy available energy, constant conservation occurs in the brain through these different types of mechanisms.

409
00:54:49,810 --> 00:54:55,240
So what else? This is how the brain responds to this energy efficiency.

410
00:54:55,960 --> 00:55:02,620
It can affect glucagon levels by increasing glucagon, causing the liver to produce more glucose.

411
00:55:03,580 --> 00:55:10,780
It activates the hypothalamic pituitary axis, increased corticosterone and all of these.

412
00:55:11,170 --> 00:55:17,650
These two effects increase hepatic glucose output and increase blood glucose levels.

413
00:55:18,970 --> 00:55:26,590
So there's mechanisms that conserve energy in the mechanisms that lead to greater glucose output.

414
00:55:33,690 --> 00:55:45,339
So. We have situations in which that appetite that you might have for a particular food or that particular time of day,

415
00:55:45,340 --> 00:55:48,610
that might and or be shut down immediately.

416
00:55:49,180 --> 00:55:53,830
And this has been described as the American emergency near a circuits that inhibit feeding.

417
00:55:55,060 --> 00:56:10,060
So the paper mentions some circumstances where there is a process that occurs in the brain that indicates that the individual is in danger.

418
00:56:11,800 --> 00:56:17,860
And this can come in the form of a particular food that you've ingested.

419
00:56:18,960 --> 00:56:23,190
So we are averse to bitter taste. For most of us are.

420
00:56:23,850 --> 00:56:32,370
And we're averse to bitter taste because many toxic substances found in food have this bitter sensation.

421
00:56:33,510 --> 00:56:36,900
So we don't like better foods, especially in young children.

422
00:56:37,080 --> 00:56:45,480
They don't like bitter foods. The consumption of things that have this bitter flavor is kind of like an acquired taste.

423
00:56:46,020 --> 00:56:50,880
So how many of you, when you were three years old, enjoyed consuming black coffee?

424
00:56:51,780 --> 00:56:55,080
Not any of you. Or, you know.

425
00:56:55,650 --> 00:57:02,580
So these are coffee and other types of food items have had this bitter flavor over time.

426
00:57:02,580 --> 00:57:05,670
Develop a taste preference for that. Right.

427
00:57:06,480 --> 00:57:11,850
And you've learned that that particular bitter flavor isn't going to harm you.

428
00:57:12,900 --> 00:57:17,910
But in many circumstances, the immediate reaction is, I don't like that.

429
00:57:17,910 --> 00:57:21,390
I'm not going to eat that because it might harm me.

430
00:57:21,630 --> 00:57:31,260
Okay. And this is an example of how this emergency circuit system is turned on, even if you're not if you're very hungry.

431
00:57:31,560 --> 00:57:42,930
Okay. So, you know, it's essentially an off switch that inhibits appetite regardless of your need for energy.

432
00:57:43,500 --> 00:57:51,900
So another example that I can give you is this is gross, but the smell of vomit.

433
00:57:52,200 --> 00:58:00,510
Okay. You know, once you no matter how hungry you are, if you get a whiff of that smell, your appetite is gone.

434
00:58:01,680 --> 00:58:09,090
Your brain is saying, hey, somebody maybe you did, but somebody in your vicinity has this reaction.

435
00:58:09,240 --> 00:58:12,300
And perhaps it means that we're in danger.

436
00:58:12,330 --> 00:58:15,930
So your appetite shuts down immediately.

437
00:58:16,110 --> 00:58:20,340
That's another example of how this system can be activated.

438
00:58:21,340 --> 00:58:27,990
Okay. Another example is if you are in a life threatening situation,

439
00:58:29,340 --> 00:58:35,820
you're being in the case that's mentioned in the paper, you're being chased by a predator.

440
00:58:37,170 --> 00:58:41,910
In modern times, life threatening situations can take many different forms.

441
00:58:42,180 --> 00:58:47,340
But the point of this is these emergency circuits are activated.

442
00:58:47,520 --> 00:58:52,020
And the purpose of them is to shut down appetite. So you can do other things.

443
00:58:52,230 --> 00:59:00,990
Okay. So these emergency circuits impinge on when you show up.

444
00:59:01,920 --> 00:59:05,490
They impinge on this particular center in the brain. Okay.

445
00:59:06,240 --> 00:59:10,260
So within this particular center, this is a pair of brachial nuclei.

446
00:59:10,710 --> 00:59:21,270
You have different inputs coming into this center. So you have projections from a goodie related peptide, neurons in the output nucleus.

447
00:59:21,870 --> 00:59:32,010
And this signal inhibits the activity of these neurons, these CG RPE neurons.

448
00:59:34,140 --> 00:59:39,060
These are neurons that can shut down appetite.

449
00:59:39,510 --> 00:59:47,790
So this is the, the calcitonin gene related peptide neurons.

450
00:59:47,790 --> 00:59:52,590
That's what S.T.A.R.T. stands for. Inhibits the activity of this.

451
00:59:53,040 --> 00:59:59,460
Okay. If you didn't have this inhibition, if these were allowed to act all by themselves, you never eat.

452
01:00:00,120 --> 01:00:08,910
So this is the off switch. And this off switch is inhibited by the neuron neuron projections from the HRP neurons and not after the effects.

453
01:00:10,510 --> 01:00:13,719
We also have projections,

454
01:00:13,720 --> 01:00:25,480
growth projections from the U.S. The NTSB is going to respond to emergency signals that can come in the form of of serotonin.

455
01:00:26,470 --> 01:00:35,860
Serotonin can activate receptors in the yes, there are projections and then get to the pair of brachial nuclei,

456
01:00:36,130 --> 01:00:43,150
activate this particular these sets of neurons. And this turns this response of eating, producing anorexia.

457
01:00:43,990 --> 01:00:51,129
So this is the off switch that occurs and this which can be activated with different

458
01:00:51,130 --> 01:00:58,090
kinds of stimuli that you find either dangerous or in the case of vomit on appetizing.

459
01:00:58,990 --> 01:01:05,020
It can also come in the form of a food that you you don't particularly like or you find disgusting.

460
01:01:05,200 --> 01:01:14,620
Okay? And so if you are presented with food options that you don't like, this can make you less hungry.

461
01:01:15,940 --> 01:01:24,250
So that's how this this is another system that can affect your desire to consume a particular food.

462
01:01:24,430 --> 01:01:33,909
Yeah, you know, because, like, with, like children's feeding disorders, especially in autistic are people on the autistic spectrum.

463
01:01:33,910 --> 01:01:37,870
They, a lot of teams are very averse to many types of food.

464
01:01:38,050 --> 01:01:43,320
So, you know, there's been research to see if this changes.

465
01:01:43,720 --> 01:01:54,860
So that's a really good question, first of all. But in order to do that type of research, we'd have to have some kind of a model system, right,

466
01:01:55,570 --> 01:02:03,670
where you would take somebody who has some taste divergence and then you would want to look at the activity in their brain perhaps,

467
01:02:04,210 --> 01:02:16,510
or their response to aversive stimuli versus some something that has no value in terms of their appetizer and appetizer.

468
01:02:17,170 --> 01:02:24,370
So you'd have to create a model system to study that I've not seen and not seen papers that have looked at that in particular.

469
01:02:24,390 --> 01:02:28,570
But that's potentially a mechanism.

470
01:02:28,570 --> 01:02:35,750
I don't know. I can as a as a parent to, um, to children who have autism.

471
01:02:36,230 --> 01:02:42,470
I can tell you that there's a lot of things going on there in terms of taste aversion, and it's, it's complicated.

472
01:02:42,830 --> 01:02:47,240
And their preferences for certain tastes change as they get older.

473
01:02:48,230 --> 01:02:53,060
And what we try to do as parents is to present them with many different food options.

474
01:02:53,720 --> 01:02:59,810
And, um, so they learned, you know, okay, you, you've got to have a fair amount of vegetables on your plate when you eat.

475
01:02:59,810 --> 01:03:04,040
And here's that, here's a protein source and a source of grains and so on.

476
01:03:04,520 --> 01:03:10,040
Within that structure, they were able to decide, I like this and I like this and I like this,

477
01:03:10,040 --> 01:03:17,899
but I know I it's good for me to eat these types of foods so you can by presenting them with lots of options,

478
01:03:17,900 --> 01:03:23,299
you can prevent them from avoiding entire food groups because they might have an aversion to a

479
01:03:23,300 --> 01:03:28,070
certain type of vitamin like broccoli as an example of a better food that kids just won't eat.

480
01:03:28,880 --> 01:03:34,720
Yeah. Is serotonin usually in emergency? So in this case.

481
01:03:35,230 --> 01:03:40,240
In this case, it is. Okay. So you can you can give.

482
01:03:40,480 --> 01:03:48,880
You can you can take a drug now that can stimulate this receptor and it can cause a cessation of appetite there.

483
01:03:49,150 --> 01:03:56,530
When we talk about pharmacologic treatment later in the semester, it uses this particular pathway.

484
01:03:57,320 --> 01:04:03,790
So if you have high serotonin levels, you are turning off this pathway.

485
01:04:04,670 --> 01:04:08,700
So this is this is a okay.

486
01:04:08,710 --> 01:04:11,950
This is a pathway.

487
01:04:12,670 --> 01:04:16,610
Here's a, um, a nuclear center within the brain.

488
01:04:16,640 --> 01:04:23,230
Okay. This is a cell body that produces serotonin in the brain.

489
01:04:24,620 --> 01:04:36,980
That activates this receptor. And in this system it inhibits appetite and activates this inhibitory effect and activates the RPA neurons.

490
01:04:38,450 --> 01:04:43,130
Emergency signals refers to other things, not not serotonin levels.

491
01:04:44,720 --> 01:04:52,850
So the serotonin is produced by these neurons. There's a difference.

492
01:04:52,850 --> 01:05:01,040
There's a difference there. What you're saying here. Okay.

493
01:05:01,040 --> 01:05:04,430
Any questions about this, these emergent signals?

494
01:05:04,760 --> 01:05:12,580
Good questions today, by the way. So this I think this is the last slide.

495
01:05:13,390 --> 01:05:17,770
This slide kind of gives a summary. So we have homeostatic and hedonic systems.

496
01:05:19,840 --> 01:05:26,680
So the homeostatic system we have this refers to metabolic regulation.

497
01:05:27,070 --> 01:05:42,640
It's driven by a biologic needs so that the signals that arise from having not enough glucose and lower levels of leptin, lower levels of insulin.

498
01:05:43,330 --> 01:05:54,580
This is an example of this homeostatic process activating the sensation of hunger based on the need for energy substrates.

499
01:05:55,210 --> 01:05:59,680
It's regulated by the nuclei.

500
01:05:59,770 --> 01:06:03,550
Hypothalamus and the nucleus is a solitary.

501
01:06:03,570 --> 01:06:15,900
Structures are yes brainstem. An idiotic system is the cognitive or emotional value of particular food leading to reward,

502
01:06:16,620 --> 01:06:21,060
and it's regulated by reward centers in the nucleus accumbens.

503
01:06:21,600 --> 01:06:26,190
And these systems are highly integrated.

504
01:06:26,490 --> 01:06:38,220
They affect your willingness to eat something, and it can also affect your perception of the value of that particular food while you're eating it.

505
01:06:39,720 --> 01:06:47,550
You gave the example of your you're eating a dessert item, let's say a piece of cake, and it looks really good.

506
01:06:47,790 --> 01:06:56,219
And your perception of that reward is higher if you are in a state where you need the

507
01:06:56,220 --> 01:07:01,620
calories or you have low levels of circulating blood glucose and more or less and so on.

508
01:07:02,220 --> 01:07:06,000
So that rewarding qualities of that food looked really good initially.

509
01:07:06,720 --> 01:07:13,980
As you eat that food, it activates this sensation of satiety slowly,

510
01:07:14,220 --> 01:07:20,490
and if you're eating that food more slowly, that you'll be more receptive to those types of signals.

511
01:07:21,100 --> 01:07:28,350
You reach a point where you either consume, you can consume all of it, or you are getting the sensation of fullness.

512
01:07:29,280 --> 01:07:36,030
And while you're getting the sensation of fullness, the rewarding properties of that food decline.

513
01:07:36,180 --> 01:07:40,980
So this response can in real time change very quickly.

514
01:07:42,360 --> 01:07:49,740
Yeah, I know this is not a well formulated question, but with, you know, the highly palatable foods.

515
01:07:50,730 --> 01:07:56,700
I was just thinking like, what if you're eating things that you, you know, feel bland or don't feel like?

516
01:07:56,730 --> 01:08:05,150
Is it possible to not feel satiated if you're eating things that don't have any type of reward in the.

517
01:08:05,310 --> 01:08:08,130
You know what I mean? That's a that's an interesting question.

518
01:08:08,770 --> 01:08:18,390
Can your sensation of of all this being affected by things with high reward versus things that are kind of neutral?

519
01:08:18,760 --> 01:08:25,500
Yeah. So. Those signals are going to.

520
01:08:25,560 --> 01:08:30,870
So they're rewarding properties of food that the hedonic system won't have the same influence.

521
01:08:32,090 --> 01:08:36,110
So it's an idiotic system isn't having the same influence.

522
01:08:36,740 --> 01:08:41,810
Perhaps your dispensation of fullness might come a little bit earlier.

523
01:08:42,410 --> 01:08:48,020
Right. There's not. So there's no interference from the rewarding qualities of that particular fruit.

524
01:08:48,920 --> 01:08:51,049
So the presence of highly palatable food,

525
01:08:51,050 --> 01:09:00,980
you're more likely to consume more calories than you actually need because they non-existent is suppressing the satiety signals and they don't exist.

526
01:09:01,070 --> 01:09:04,200
Are how many stacks? Thank.

527
01:09:05,250 --> 01:09:20,820
So this gets to the question of, okay, so what's going on now in terms of why we have why if you had this big change and an increasing BMI since 1960,

528
01:09:21,390 --> 01:09:33,600
and when you look back in history in terms of foods available, they all go back to what happened in terms of supplying soldiers in World War Two.

529
01:09:34,620 --> 01:09:44,460
So in World War two, you had the first development of convenience foods, and this came in the form of K rations and canned foods.

530
01:09:44,910 --> 01:09:53,460
And they also came in the form of convenience foods that they could eat that didn't require any kind of preservations preservation.

531
01:09:54,030 --> 01:09:57,900
So it was at that time that there was this birth of this new industry.

532
01:09:58,120 --> 01:09:58,980
Snack foods.

533
01:10:00,060 --> 01:10:10,350
So if you look at the number of snack foods available since the forties, they exploded in terms of the number of options that you can consume.

534
01:10:11,160 --> 01:10:18,000
And perhaps it's the snack foods that we're consuming that have this incredible appeal

535
01:10:18,390 --> 01:10:26,040
that can explain this rise in energy intake that we've seen in the past several decades.

536
01:10:28,050 --> 01:10:31,860
Okay. Yeah.

537
01:10:31,920 --> 01:10:40,979
Another kind of random question but like overall for I know we've talked a bit have some of the articles about like food addiction and stuff,

538
01:10:40,980 --> 01:10:48,120
but the overall like brain processes that go along with lighting up when we see something

539
01:10:48,990 --> 01:10:56,340
exciting is that like more with food than like other things in general that we might like?

540
01:10:56,340 --> 01:11:00,170
If someone really likes puppies and they see a puppy, is it like this?

541
01:11:00,480 --> 01:11:06,510
You know, similar over I know it's different process, but I just know like, are we compared to one another?

542
01:11:06,570 --> 01:11:09,160
Yeah, I don't know. That's a really good question.

543
01:11:09,660 --> 01:11:17,040
When you get the same, um, quantitatively, the same response to something that you find really pleasurable.

544
01:11:17,080 --> 01:11:24,810
Yeah, yeah. Good question. I don't know. Um, I do know I will say this though.

545
01:11:25,440 --> 01:11:38,100
Your perception of food reward can change. So, um, I showed you this image before I get it here, so.

546
01:11:42,800 --> 01:11:55,100
So for people who change their eating behavior and try to increase the amount of fruits and vegetables in their diet for whatever reason,

547
01:11:55,480 --> 01:12:03,950
and and if you study these people longitudinally and they stick to this, their perception of the hedonic value, it's not showing up here.

548
01:12:04,220 --> 01:12:12,060
Sorry. No.

549
01:12:12,710 --> 01:12:18,900
Somebody's messing with this. So I go back to 19.

550
01:12:27,750 --> 01:12:33,360
So it's not it's not even responding to the mass graves.

551
01:12:36,100 --> 01:12:42,890
It's working here, but not there. All right. So if you look at the figure that has the fruits and vegetables side of the vegetables on it.

552
01:12:44,180 --> 01:12:55,100
If your diet changes and you're getting into the habit of eating more fruits and vegetables, your pedantic system over time may respond to that.

553
01:12:56,390 --> 01:13:00,910
If you include more than your diet and it might increase the hedonic value of those types of foods,

554
01:13:00,920 --> 01:13:08,060
you might find them more pleasurable because you're eating less of other things and you're eating more of these healthy types of foods.

555
01:13:08,660 --> 01:13:15,270
And there's a there's a paper that I usually show, but it's, it's really long that that that response.

556
01:13:15,930 --> 01:13:25,159
Yeah. Because you are distorting sensations defense between different people for example depending that's for example binge eat

557
01:13:25,160 --> 01:13:32,440
or for those that have emotional eating do things like perceive that more things as more intense compared to others.

558
01:13:32,870 --> 01:13:35,930
So that reward sensitivity varies from person to person.

559
01:13:36,290 --> 01:13:43,699
And people who have been diagnosed with binge eating disorder have greater reward sensitivity.

560
01:13:43,700 --> 01:13:48,980
So they their hedonic systems are really fired up in response to highly palatable food.

561
01:13:49,070 --> 01:13:51,650
And that can initiate that type of behavior. Yes.

562
01:13:52,610 --> 01:14:03,469
And but again, you know, after after when somebody has changed their diet, um, it can change the perception of the reward itself.

563
01:14:03,470 --> 01:14:14,030
And then this can occur over a long period of time. And it's thought that providing people with a greater variety of food,

564
01:14:14,030 --> 01:14:18,620
that it can change your perception of a rewarding quality of a particular contact.

565
01:14:19,070 --> 01:14:26,390
And you are seeing images for the food choices actually works for short term.

566
01:14:28,970 --> 01:14:30,410
Explain what you mean by that.

567
01:14:31,370 --> 01:14:41,600
These people will serve these human committees and then they start to not want to eat certain food, but it works out around three months.

568
01:14:41,930 --> 01:14:45,950
So it's just like a conversion therapy now. Hypnotism, autism.

569
01:14:45,980 --> 01:14:49,150
I've not heard about this hypnotizing.

570
01:14:49,160 --> 01:14:53,480
Oh, yeah. Because of hypnotism, I have not had not heard that.

571
01:14:54,710 --> 01:14:58,550
Interesting. Okay. That's all I have for you today.

572
01:15:00,830 --> 01:15:06,680
So I will see you on Wednesday and I'll give you some details about this family.

573
01:15:10,530 --> 01:15:26,730
You know, I mean, you know, I certainly appreciate your insight into what it was like.

574
01:15:27,060 --> 01:15:27,301
Think I had to work out so well.

575
01:15:31,717 --> 01:15:31,927
And.
