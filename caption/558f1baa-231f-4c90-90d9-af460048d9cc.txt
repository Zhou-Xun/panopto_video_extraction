00:00:05,980 --> 00:00:15,340
Hello. You are watching this to learn about the next phase of your scaffolding assignment.

2
00:00:16,270 --> 00:00:20,800
So today we're going to go over your report, draft and peer review details.

3
00:00:23,860 --> 00:00:25,809
So far of your scaffolding assignment.

4
00:00:25,810 --> 00:00:36,340
You have had to submit your planning worksheet and submit the development three pager of about policies and programing.

5
00:00:39,300 --> 00:00:53,490
And what's due next. Which is in two weeks is the draft and not just the draft, but also the peer review that you'll be providing of the draft.

6
00:00:54,450 --> 00:01:01,860
So we'll go over both of these things. One will be due on November 18th and one will be due on November 21st.

7
00:01:05,570 --> 00:01:13,160
So first is the draft report again due November 18th at 11:59 p.m. and you will have two days grace period.

8
00:01:13,730 --> 00:01:17,960
After that will be the peer review of the draft report, which we'll go over in detail.

9
00:01:18,950 --> 00:01:23,720
This will be due November 21st at 1159. And you you'll also have a two day grace period for this.

10
00:01:25,960 --> 00:01:30,520
So for the draft. So you've been building up to this moment, right?

11
00:01:30,820 --> 00:01:35,200
You did a worksheet which is going to give you some information that's going to go into this draft.

12
00:01:35,560 --> 00:01:41,920
You did this policy and planning three pager, which should also contribute to this draft.

13
00:01:42,310 --> 00:01:46,240
And for this assignment, that should be no longer than five pages.

14
00:01:46,570 --> 00:01:52,870
We ask for you to include your page numbers. We want you to include an introduction and a conclusion.

15
00:01:53,140 --> 00:01:57,850
But an abstract is not necessary. We do ask that you use headings.

16
00:01:58,150 --> 00:02:03,820
It is encouraged. Headings that clearly organize your paper mean that you've.

17
00:02:04,540 --> 00:02:13,060
You've thought about how well-organized your paper could be. And so we're encouraging headings.

18
00:02:14,650 --> 00:02:19,270
We would like for you to cite your sources in either APA or AMA style and include

19
00:02:19,270 --> 00:02:24,759
a reference list that references will not be counted towards your page limit,

20
00:02:24,760 --> 00:02:32,590
which again is no longer than five pages. And we'd like you to use Time's new Roman font size 12 with one inch margins double spaced.

21
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:47,960
So the grading schema for this project is that between the five page draft and your peer review,

22
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:50,810
you're going to be graded out of a total of 100 points.

23
00:02:51,470 --> 00:02:57,380
So instructors will grade for completion of each section of the prompt, but we will not provide substantive feedback.

24
00:02:58,010 --> 00:03:01,760
The instruction evaluation of your draft is worth 80 points.

25
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:08,190
To get feedback to help you revise for the final, you'll actually complete and receive one peer review.

26
00:03:08,660 --> 00:03:15,950
So the substantive feedback that you will get about what needs to come next will actually come from your peer.

27
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:22,430
So you're going to provide substantive feedback to someone who's also doing the same state as you and vice versa.

28
00:03:23,960 --> 00:03:27,710
So the peer review you provide to your partner will be graded, right?

29
00:03:27,710 --> 00:03:33,170
So we are grading the quality of the peer review that you provide for your partner.

30
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:41,000
The peer review complete is worth 20 points, so 80 points for the five page or 20 points for the peer review.

31
00:03:42,830 --> 00:03:46,430
So the peer review portion will be assigned and graded by the size.

32
00:03:47,690 --> 00:03:52,520
The draft report and peer review together are worth 20% of your overall course grade.

33
00:03:54,900 --> 00:04:00,150
So let's go over the draft report prompt. So for your draft, you'll have two main goals.

34
00:04:00,300 --> 00:04:05,310
First, we want you to briefly summarize what you've learned and wrote for the planning worksheet and mini report.

35
00:04:06,060 --> 00:04:11,550
And second, we want you to develop a stronger understanding of racial disparities for COVID in your state or locality.

36
00:04:12,270 --> 00:04:18,780
So you are welcome and encouraged to use text from your own previously submitted work from the planning worksheet and the mini report,

37
00:04:19,230 --> 00:04:24,450
though you will likely need to revise as you prioritize and summarize to fit it into a shorter page limit.

38
00:04:24,990 --> 00:04:30,030
So we're not looking for you to copy and paste and then just put it into this new five pager.

39
00:04:30,390 --> 00:04:38,760
You're going to actually have to synthesize, reorganize, rethink how you want to position your your argument.

40
00:04:39,180 --> 00:04:44,790
And but you should consider that anything that you've already written is fair game to go into this draft.

41
00:04:46,830 --> 00:04:52,710
So the purpose of this assignment is to help you practice the following skills that are essential to your success in this course.

42
00:04:53,430 --> 00:04:59,340
Develop skills in seeking and compiling public health, relevant information and preparation for analysis and evaluation.

43
00:04:59,790 --> 00:05:05,040
You're already doing this. You are already doing a really great job of investigating and finding out what you need

44
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:09,330
to find and then putting that relevant information into the space that you need to.

45
00:05:10,380 --> 00:05:14,540
We want you to develop skills and understanding, analyzing and describing health disparities.

46
00:05:14,790 --> 00:05:19,889
And we want you to synthesize information to prepare for critical analysis of your state agencies.

47
00:05:19,890 --> 00:05:29,940
COVID Response. So for this for this five pager, we're not asking for any deep criticality from you, but we will for the final.

48
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:37,470
So just keep that in mind as you're thinking about and reading and writing what you're compiling for this page, for this five pager,

49
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:45,300
the next step is for you to add on to that five pages to give a slice of critical analysis about your state's COVID response.

50
00:05:45,300 --> 00:05:49,890
So we're going to ask you questions about how you think they did, what they were lacking,

51
00:05:49,890 --> 00:05:54,390
what you what you would have done to make it stronger, etc., etc.

52
00:05:56,010 --> 00:06:01,500
So this assignment will also help you to become familiar with the following important content knowledge in this discipline.

53
00:06:02,070 --> 00:06:09,690
So we want you to develop knowledge about racial and ethnic disparities and COVID 19 infection, hospitalization, mortality, and other impacts.

54
00:06:10,920 --> 00:06:16,050
And so now we've got to the tasks. This is what we want you to actually do for this segment.

55
00:06:16,770 --> 00:06:22,559
We expect 1.5 pages worth of the five pager for you to use information that you gathered in your

56
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:27,750
planning worksheet summarizing the main points surrounding COVID 19 and your state or locality,

57
00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:31,920
how your agency responded initially and how the response has evolved.

58
00:06:32,250 --> 00:06:39,000
Build a narrative for this space. So before there are just sentences and statements, now we want you to build a story.

59
00:06:40,290 --> 00:06:46,590
We also want you to develop 1.5 pages of the five pages in which you'll use the information you reported on in your mini report.

60
00:06:47,070 --> 00:06:52,410
And so you'll briefly summarize the policy and partnerships that are relevant to your state or local agencies.

61
00:06:53,280 --> 00:07:00,480
And then two new pages to summarize the impact of COVID 19 by racial and ethnic group in your state or locality.

62
00:07:01,470 --> 00:07:09,780
This will include a brief introduction summarizing if and how racial or ethnic health disparities played out in your locality with COVID 19.

63
00:07:10,710 --> 00:07:18,690
What is a racial breakdown of your state or region? What's the percentage of black latinxs and or indigenous people in your locality?

64
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:24,270
You can use census, dot gov and any other kind of data to support this.

65
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:32,970
How do COVID impacts the people in your region? BI racial group provide information on infection, hospitalization and mortality if available.

66
00:07:33,450 --> 00:07:34,169
For example,

67
00:07:34,170 --> 00:07:41,310
what was the COVID incidence rate and mortality rate among each group and how does it compare to the representation of that group in the population?

68
00:07:41,820 --> 00:07:44,730
So we want you to we want you to provide a data summary.

69
00:07:46,700 --> 00:07:53,600
The vaccination rates differ by race, where those who are most impacted by COVID 19 more are less likely to get vaccinated.

70
00:07:54,050 --> 00:07:59,570
So remember that in your planning three pager we asked you who were those that might be most impacted?

71
00:07:59,900 --> 00:08:04,430
Feel free to take that information that you've already provided to expound on it for this five pager.

72
00:08:05,510 --> 00:08:09,920
Did your state or local agency develop any programs to respond to racial disparities?

73
00:08:10,310 --> 00:08:14,930
What were they? How were they supposed to work? Is there any evidence of impact?

74
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:20,960
Those are the things we want you to consider and to answer for this five pager.

75
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:25,640
Now we will transition to the peer review.

76
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:29,540
So here are some basics on giving a peer review.

77
00:08:30,320 --> 00:08:36,440
Basically, peer reviews are a critique, and critiques provide insightful reflection on a written piece.

78
00:08:37,130 --> 00:08:40,790
They allow you the opportunity to express your thoughts on another person's work

79
00:08:41,150 --> 00:08:45,110
and either contribute or scholastically disagree with the author's main points.

80
00:08:45,890 --> 00:08:50,000
Prior to beginning the critique, we'd like you to read the source material several times.

81
00:08:50,510 --> 00:08:55,730
It's important to acknowledge what the author has done well in the same ways in which

82
00:08:56,150 --> 00:08:59,600
someone reading your work you'd want for them to acknowledge what you've done well.

83
00:09:00,470 --> 00:09:05,510
After identifying areas of success, then becomes easier to highlight areas for improvement.

84
00:09:06,650 --> 00:09:13,700
While you are making commentary about those areas for improvement, we would like you to avoid using language that's too casual.

85
00:09:14,030 --> 00:09:17,780
So saying something like I didn't like this paper would be inappropriate,

86
00:09:18,020 --> 00:09:23,330
but you could break down some of the problems that you thought you saw with the paper and then suggest recommendations.

87
00:09:24,530 --> 00:09:29,690
This critique should offer criticism of the author's ideas rather than attacking the author's personality.

88
00:09:30,140 --> 00:09:32,870
So we want you to be gracious. We want you to have grace.

89
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:41,780
We want you to be kind in how you're thinking about the criticism and reflection and review that you're providing to your classmates colleague.

90
00:09:43,880 --> 00:09:51,560
So this peer review is going to be due November 21st, a few days after the the five pagers do.

91
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:59,780
So, you will review the draft of your peer who has been working on the same locality as you please see to find your partner for the assignment.

92
00:10:01,130 --> 00:10:03,020
The purpose is to gain experience.

93
00:10:03,020 --> 00:10:10,010
In giving constructive feedback, you receive useful feedback on your paper from a peer as you prepare your final report.

94
00:10:10,940 --> 00:10:14,810
And we also want you to learn about the pandemic response from the research of a peer.

95
00:10:16,190 --> 00:10:21,950
So the guidelines include to first skim over your peers essay to quickly get an overview of the piece.

96
00:10:22,700 --> 00:10:27,230
Next, read the essay more slowly keeping the worksheet questions in mind.

97
00:10:28,220 --> 00:10:31,730
Highlight the pieces of text that let you directly address the worksheet.

98
00:10:31,730 --> 00:10:36,590
Questions you hope you'll get these worksheet questions in canvas and they're already posted there.

99
00:10:37,550 --> 00:10:46,190
And your responses to the worksheet questions focus on higher order concerns of content rather than lower order concerns like grammar and spelling.

100
00:10:46,610 --> 00:10:50,930
But remember, you are being graded overall for grammar and spelling.

101
00:10:51,230 --> 00:10:57,740
So if the paper you're reviewing is egregious, full of typos, things like that, then you want to make sure to mention it.

102
00:10:57,860 --> 00:11:06,169
But don't focus on every little bit. Be very specific in your responses, referring to your peers, actual language,

103
00:11:06,170 --> 00:11:11,150
mentioning terms and concepts that are either present or missing, and following the directions in the prompt.

104
00:11:11,990 --> 00:11:18,140
And of course again, use respectful language whether you are suggesting improvements to or praise in your peer.

105
00:11:18,890 --> 00:11:21,830
We expect you to spend about an hour on this assignment.

106
00:11:24,410 --> 00:11:30,770
These are the prompts that you'll find on canvas to help you with your guidance or to guide you through your review.

107
00:11:32,390 --> 00:11:39,860
In the first part of the draft, the essay should summarize the main points surrounding COVID 19 in the state or locality and how the agency responded.

108
00:11:40,520 --> 00:11:46,280
After reading the section of the essay, do you have an overall understanding of what happened in the state or locality?

109
00:11:46,580 --> 00:11:51,920
According to the pandemic and the agency's response, saying yes or no is okay here?

110
00:11:53,030 --> 00:11:57,440
What are the sections strengths? What could be done to improve the section?

111
00:11:57,920 --> 00:12:03,860
This is the place where you spend a little bit more time and making sure that you're letting your partner know.

112
00:12:04,190 --> 00:12:07,580
What are the strengths and what are the things that could be improved?

113
00:12:07,790 --> 00:12:14,450
And remember that we're grading your peer review of the other person, so we want you to be thorough and thoughtful.

114
00:12:16,670 --> 00:12:23,480
In the second part of the draft, the essay should briefly summarize the policy and partnerships that are relevant to the state or local agency.

115
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:30,170
After reading the section of the essay, do you have a good understanding of the local policy response to COVID 19?

116
00:12:30,920 --> 00:12:37,730
Due to some confusion related to the prompt, your peer might have addressed partnerships in general and not specific to vaccination.

117
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:41,900
Please consider both possibilities as valid responses to the prompt.

118
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:43,450
Yes or no is okay.

119
00:12:45,220 --> 00:12:51,760
After reading the section of the essay, do you have a good understanding of how the agency used partnerships to respond to COVID 19?

120
00:12:52,120 --> 00:12:57,550
Yes or no? Okay. What are the sections strengths and how could they improve this section?

121
00:12:59,590 --> 00:13:05,980
In the third part of the draft. The essay should summarize the impact of COVID 19 by race and ethnicity in the state or locality.

122
00:13:06,370 --> 00:13:11,109
So after reading the section, do you have a good understanding of the racial and ethnic health disparities that

123
00:13:11,110 --> 00:13:16,330
exist in the state or locality and whether or how the health agency is responding?

124
00:13:16,810 --> 00:13:22,540
Yes or no? Okay. So tell us what the section strengths are and how it could be improved.

125
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:26,340
Once you have completed your peer review and submitted it to canvas,

126
00:13:26,350 --> 00:13:34,420
please also send a copy to the authors so that they know what they need to do by the time they're able to work on their final draft,

127
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:38,080
which they'll submit into canvas at the end of the semester.

128
00:13:39,520 --> 00:13:43,300
Thanks for your attention and if you have any questions at all,

129
00:13:43,660 --> 00:13:50,380
please do not hesitate to send an email or go to office hours with myself, McKean or Jessica.

130
00:13:50,770 --> 00:13:51,370
Thanks so much.
