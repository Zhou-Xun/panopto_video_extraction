00:00:03,680 --> 00:00:14,000
Hi everyone. I am here to talk to you today about the next assignment that is due on October 20th,

2
00:00:14,630 --> 00:00:18,980
which we call the development part of the scaffolding assignment.

3
00:00:24,040 --> 00:00:29,079
So you have already submitted the planning worksheet.

4
00:00:29,080 --> 00:00:31,510
Thank you very much. That was due on September 22nd.

5
00:00:32,020 --> 00:00:40,450
And we have just recently made available and published online the next phase of the scaffold assignment for 381,

6
00:00:40,450 --> 00:00:46,510
which is policies and partnerships, and it's a three page mini report.

7
00:00:46,900 --> 00:00:54,370
So we're going to talk about the goals and details of this assignment and give you space to ask any questions you may have afterwards.

8
00:00:58,540 --> 00:01:06,670
So as I said, this is a three page mini report which basically sets up this work that that you do now that's due in October,

9
00:01:07,060 --> 00:01:12,610
will set you up nicely so that when it's time for you to submit the draft and then the final,

10
00:01:12,610 --> 00:01:16,510
you've already gotten this part of the work done of the report.

11
00:01:16,870 --> 00:01:20,829
So your goal in this assignment is to summarize how your state or the county that you've

12
00:01:20,830 --> 00:01:25,690
been assigned to addresses policies and partnerships with respect to its COVID 19 response.

13
00:01:26,230 --> 00:01:30,250
And this is a response in over time.

14
00:01:30,610 --> 00:01:38,050
So from the beginning of on, when your state declared a public emergency until now and looking at that trajectory.

15
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:43,540
So part one will focus on policies related to the pandemic that your state or locality enacted.

16
00:01:45,550 --> 00:01:53,800
And it will and this report will identify any policies that were created to respond to unique characteristics of your state or locality.

17
00:01:54,190 --> 00:02:00,009
And then part two is about focusing on the partnerships that your state or the county forged

18
00:02:00,010 --> 00:02:04,060
or leverage in order to carry out the policies and plans that you summarized in Part one.

19
00:02:08,220 --> 00:02:12,030
So let's go over part one. So part one is the policies piece.

20
00:02:12,900 --> 00:02:19,020
And some of the things that we're asking you are what were some of the current policies that were enacted at your state,

21
00:02:19,020 --> 00:02:27,180
county or city level around COVID 19? We'd like you to trace how these policies changed over time and what they look like currently.

22
00:02:28,020 --> 00:02:34,170
For instance, New York removed their mask mandate for public transit on September 7th, 2022.

23
00:02:35,220 --> 00:02:46,290
So think about the policies that you might investigate, which could include masks, distancing, stay at home policies, school or business closures.

24
00:02:47,430 --> 00:02:50,280
What happened in the retirement communities?

25
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:58,260
And we also want you to think about if there are any policies specific to your state or locality that might not be applicable to other states.

26
00:03:00,030 --> 00:03:03,640
Part two is then thinking about the partnerships.

27
00:03:03,690 --> 00:03:08,400
So who did your state have to partner with in order to get some of these policies done?

28
00:03:08,850 --> 00:03:15,270
You want you to provide evidence of partnerships between your health agency and other components of the public health system.

29
00:03:15,810 --> 00:03:19,620
You should describe how the partnerships you identify are defined.

30
00:03:19,890 --> 00:03:28,560
So the partnership will will alter and change depending on who the entities are and what that relationship is.

31
00:03:28,890 --> 00:03:35,430
So the kind of partnership that the State Health Department has with the pharmaceutical company or a drug chain

32
00:03:36,630 --> 00:03:44,340
might look different than the partnership it has with an educational or institutional academic institution,

33
00:03:44,340 --> 00:03:51,030
for instance. Did your state want to reach teachers in a particular kind of way?

34
00:03:51,030 --> 00:04:02,670
And so they partnered with the school board. Did your state partner with certain sporting agencies or groups?

35
00:04:02,700 --> 00:04:07,890
Did your state partner with a different academic institution?

36
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:14,070
I think a similarity or perhaps some sort of industry.

37
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:23,610
How did your partners, how did your state work with an entity from the federal level or a health care system, which is really important?

38
00:04:23,940 --> 00:04:28,890
Are there any non-profits or community based organizations that they that they worked with?

39
00:04:28,920 --> 00:04:37,950
So think about the different kind of partnerships that your state might have connected with in order to get some sort of policy enacted.

40
00:04:41,510 --> 00:04:49,400
So we're not looking for this to be super onerous. We're looking for this to be about three pages mass Mad Max.

41
00:04:50,810 --> 00:05:00,530
And we are looking for you can see the details in the prompt, which is found on the canvas assignment website.

42
00:05:01,010 --> 00:05:06,320
So underneath the canvas assignment for the development, you'll find a link to this video.

43
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:10,430
You'll find a link to the prompt. You'll find a link to these slides.

44
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:15,530
You'll also find a link to Maria's points where you can put your questions.

45
00:05:15,980 --> 00:05:24,680
And so the prompt itself gives you all of the details that we're looking for, all of which will look familiar after you've watched this video.

46
00:05:25,730 --> 00:05:32,330
So in that prompt, you'll see details around the spacing requirements, the citation requirements.

47
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:35,030
We want pros instead of bullets. This time,

48
00:05:35,030 --> 00:05:44,390
we want actual references and a citation list with parenthetical citations according to the citation requirements that we put on the prompt.

49
00:05:44,990 --> 00:05:50,810
So we want you to watch this video, read the prompt, and then come back with us with some questions.

50
00:05:51,230 --> 00:05:57,260
Excellent work will include an introduction which briefly summarizes what will be included in the paper.

51
00:05:57,260 --> 00:06:04,100
So don't just throw facts at us, but let us know how you're going to prepare us for what's coming.

52
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:09,229
We'd love for that to include any kind of subheadings and as well as an

53
00:06:09,230 --> 00:06:13,160
introduction so that you can describe exactly what it is that you'll be discussing.

54
00:06:13,580 --> 00:06:19,520
We want you to succinctly describe the important policies and partnerships relevant to your assigned help agencies.

55
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:25,370
COVID 19 Response. We want this to be written without grammatical or spelling errors.

56
00:06:25,640 --> 00:06:32,000
You want it to be well cited with every statement of fact followed by a citation and unlike the previous assignment,

57
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:37,400
please do not submit bullet point lists. Rather put your responses into prose or narrative.

58
00:06:39,180 --> 00:06:44,720
Last thing is, if you have any questions about this assignment,

59
00:06:44,730 --> 00:06:50,910
we want you again to watch this video first, then read the prompt closely, and then after doing so,

60
00:06:50,910 --> 00:06:58,470
be sure to let us know if you have any questions by putting it in the media link, which we have also put on canvas under the assignment prompt.

61
00:06:58,830 --> 00:07:04,620
But make sure that you use the prompt to guide you as you work through this next assignment.

62
00:07:05,010 --> 00:07:10,550
If you have any questions, let us know again through various points, through your office hours.

63
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:14,010
Do email to anyone on your the instruction team.

64
00:07:14,610 --> 00:07:19,350
We're here to answer any questions you may have, and they'll be time to go over this in class as well.

65
00:07:19,620 --> 00:07:20,010
Thanks.
