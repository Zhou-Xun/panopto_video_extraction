1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Walk through number three, the cohort studies. So we're going to do this on word document.

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:10,000
I think this is a better format. I can just write the answers in a document. OK.

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:19,000
So let's get started. Question one. Which are the following is true about the number needed to treat select all that apply.

4
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Remember, the number needed to treat is equal to one over the attributable risk or on the risk difference.

5
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:45,000
And its interpretation is essentially the number of people that you would need to treat

6
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:53,000
that treatment as preventative or expose to cause or prevent one additional case.

7
00:00:53,000 --> 00:01:00,000
So let's go through each one. Its interpretation is only appropriate if you believe the observed association is causal.

8
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:12,000
That's true. Because the only way that you could either induce an additional case or prevent a case is if the attributable risk or

9
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:17,000
the risk difference that you're looking at is actually causal and that if you apply the exposure or the treatment,

10
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:23,000
that would actually work. The next answer, it is inverse of the population attributable risk.

11
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:31,000
That's not true according to the formula below. It's one over where the reciprocal of the attributable risk or the risk difference.

12
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:38,000
It tells you how many people you need to treat in order to prevent all cases of the disease in populated population.

13
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Remember that we're just looking at disease in the population that are caused by the exposure.

14
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Not all cases of the disease. When we do a study.

15
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:53,000
And calculate something like an attributable risk, the attributable risk is obviously attributable to the exposure.

16
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:59,000
And not all cases of a disease in a population are typically caused by one exposure.

17
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:05,000
So we can roll that out. It is inverse of the attributable risk percent.

18
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:11,000
Again, just look at the formula there. That's not true. So we can rule that out.

19
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Last answer, it equals the attributable risk. It's not true because it's equal to one over or the reciprocal of the attributable risk.

20
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:26,000
OK. So question number two, can you calculate a prevalence odds ratio from across sectional study,

21
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:31,000
i.e. a study that has prevalent cases instead of instant cases?

22
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:34,000
So I think this question involves you knowing how knowing two things.

23
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:40,000
One is that prevalent is actually what you measure and all that you really can measure in a cross-sectional study.

24
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:48,000
And so we can circulate, certainly calculate property prevalence, but it also requires that, you know what all it is.

25
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:59,000
So as a reminder, odds equals the probability of an event.

26
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:09,000
Over one minus the probability of the event. So if an event is.

27
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Twenty five percent more likely than the odds would be. One.

28
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:32,000
So one, two, three odds. You can certainly do this with a prevalence that's calculated from across sexual study.

29
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:39,000
If you just substitute the probability or the prevalence, you actually calculate from it and then apply this formula.

30
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:44,000
You can calculate the odds as well. So the is.

31
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:49,000
Yes. OK.

32
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:55,000
Four questions, three and four. A case control study was done to examine the possible effect of recent oral

33
00:03:55,000 --> 00:04:02,000
contraceptive use on occurrence of breast cancer in white women ages 40 to 49.

34
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:09,000
A group of 200 newly diagnosed cases. Let's highlight the relevant information here.

35
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:12,000
Case control study, we need that information.

36
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Group of 200 newly diagnosed cases living in upstate New York where compared to a group of 400 controls selected from the same area.

37
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:31,000
Among cases, one hundred and fifty two women had to use two hundred and forty seven women had OCD use among controls.

38
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:37,000
So let's draw the case control two by two table. We'll set this up because we know we're going to calculate.

39
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:40,000
You can see question three there. We're going to calculate the odds ratio, OK?

40
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:49,000
So the way a case control study to be two table works is study like to do it like this on the outcome.

41
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:57,000
And I see a little thing like that. An outcome of the line over it means they didn't get the outcome and exposure.

42
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:03,000
No exposure. So in this two by two table column over here is gonna be your controls, right?

43
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:07,000
Because it the the controls are people in your population that didn't get the disease.

44
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:14,000
So make it easier for ourselves. The total controls will be four hundred.

45
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:22,000
The total cases. Two hundred, so that it gives you the information about the exposure which we need.

46
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:28,000
So among cases. So the first column here. One hundred and fifty two women had.

47
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:32,000
So. Fifty two would go here.

48
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:39,000
And then what do we put in this box? It's going to be the difference between the two. Right. Forty eight.

49
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:52,000
Among controls, this column. Two hundred forty seven women had OCD stoats, two forty seven were exposed, and then the difference to fill in this 153.

50
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:56,000
So now we have everything we need to solve this, these next questions.

51
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:10,000
So calculate the OAH. So the short formula for the odds ratio is A times the over, B times C.

52
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:15,000
That's the label. This is how. They're typically done.

53
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:27,000
If you set the two by two table up like this, which you should. So the odds ratio here is one fifty two times one.

54
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:34,000
Three over two. Forty seven times.

55
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:52,000
That gives us an odds ratio of one point nine six.

56
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:58,000
One point ninety six to. OK.

57
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:07,000
Calculate the 95 percent confidence interval for the odds ratio that we just got calculated.

58
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:13,000
So here we need the formula for the standard error of the log of the odds ratio.

59
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:22,000
Whenever we're calculating confidence limits for a ratio, it's going to be you can't get the standard error on the log scale.

60
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:25,000
And we can talk about in another venue why that is.

61
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:34,000
But just know that as a rule, if you're calculating confidence limits for a risk difference, then that's not going to be the case.

62
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:39,000
But it is the case here. So what's the formula for the standard error of the odds ratio?

63
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:52,000
It's going to be moved down here. Standard error, the log of the O are equal to square root.

64
00:07:52,000 --> 00:08:02,000
Over A plus over A, B, C.

65
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:12,000
So unlike in a situation where you calculate in confidence limits for a raid ratio, all the cells on the table to table.

66
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:30,000
Factor into the error calculation. So it's just gonna be this is gonna be on over 150 to plus one over forty eight plus one over ten.

67
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:35,000
Forty plus one over one fifty three.

68
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:42,000
I guess I did this a little bit of out of order huh. So but it doesn't really matter because you're just adding all of them take.

69
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:55,000
So the second one is actually see here.

70
00:08:55,000 --> 00:09:18,000
Two forty eight. This. 247, rather.

71
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:26,000
He's right. OK. So what does this equal? So we get from this point on.

72
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:34,000
I'm having trouble with my nine today.

73
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:41,000
One nine. OK. So that's the standard error.

74
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:46,000
That's a start. You have to apply that 95 percent competent formula.

75
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:49,000
I like to read it all out in one step.

76
00:09:49,000 --> 00:10:10,000
So so the lower 95 percent confidence interval is kind of B e to the log of the V o r what they are again, one point nine six to.

77
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:17,000
Minus, remember, that's a lower confidence limits or subtract one point nine.

78
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:22,000
Six times the standard error, which is 0.01.

79
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:34,000
Nine. They get their.

80
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:42,000
Three. That's right.

81
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:51,000
OK. So upper 95 percent confidence interval.

82
00:10:51,000 --> 00:11:06,699
This time it's the same. Except we add one point nine, six times the standard error.

83
00:11:08,123 --> 00:11:23,123
That's going to be to. OK, so four questions, five to eight,

84
00:11:23,123 --> 00:11:29,123
a cohort study was conducted in a closed at risk population of two thousand persons where

85
00:11:29,123 --> 00:11:36,123
twenty five percent of the population was exposed over a follow up period of three years.

86
00:11:36,123 --> 00:11:44,123
Sixty exposed persons and one hundred and twenty unexposed persons developed a the disease of interest.

87
00:11:44,123 --> 00:11:49,123
OK. So initially when I first started to do this, I actually calculated a two by two table to calculate the rate.

88
00:11:49,123 --> 00:11:54,123
But then I realized this question asks you about the cumulative incidence ratio ratio.

89
00:11:54,123 --> 00:12:03,123
That's what the CIA stands for. The cumulative incidents, remember, is the another word for that is the risk ratio.

90
00:12:03,123 --> 00:12:09,123
And so this is the two detail we need for it. It's going to be similar to the control tables.

91
00:12:09,123 --> 00:12:15,123
So we have one column that is people with our outcome on their column.

92
00:12:15,123 --> 00:12:37,123
Although the outcome. And then we've got exposed people, unexposed people.

93
00:12:37,123 --> 00:12:46,123
All right. So what do we have here? So close cohort of two thousand people.

94
00:12:46,123 --> 00:12:53,123
Right. Twenty five percent of the population was exposed. So what goes in the first row?

95
00:12:53,123 --> 00:13:09,123
Twenty five percent of two thousand, which is five hundred. And so by subtraction, we get fifteen hundred for the folks who were unexposed.

96
00:13:09,123 --> 00:13:12,123
And then how do we fill in the boxes here?

97
00:13:12,123 --> 00:13:19,123
So 60 exposed persons and one hundred and twenty expert unexposed persons developed the disease of interest.

98
00:13:19,123 --> 00:13:26,123
So that lets us fill in the first column here. So 60 Expo's persons got the disease.

99
00:13:26,123 --> 00:13:31,123
One hundred and twenty unexposed persons got that disease.

100
00:13:31,123 --> 00:13:46,123
By subtraction, we can get the. People who didn't have the outcome, which is 140.

101
00:13:46,123 --> 00:13:54,123
Thirteen, eighty. So now we have everything we need to calculate the C.A.R.

102
00:13:54,123 --> 00:14:06,123
So the cumulative incidence ratio is equal to the risk in the exposed over the risk unexposed.

103
00:14:06,123 --> 00:14:14,123
So what's that? So the risk in the exposed is 60 over 500.

104
00:14:14,123 --> 00:14:20,123
The risk and the unexposed is 120. Over 15 hundred.

105
00:14:20,123 --> 00:14:33,123
That's going to equal one point five. Calculate the attributable risk over the three year follow up.

106
00:14:33,123 --> 00:14:40,123
The attributable risk, remember, is equivalent to the risk difference.

107
00:14:40,123 --> 00:14:45,123
Is that a risk difference? Because the risk.

108
00:14:45,123 --> 00:14:59,123
The exposed group minus the risk unexposed group. So the risk in the exposed group is, again, that's 60, over 500.

109
00:14:59,123 --> 00:15:05,123
Minus one, Tony. Fifteen hundred.

110
00:15:05,123 --> 00:15:16,123
It's going to equal O point for. Or four percent.

111
00:15:16,123 --> 00:15:21,123
The attributable risk percent calculate the attributable risk percent over the three year follow up period,

112
00:15:21,123 --> 00:15:28,123
the attributable risk percent is the proportion of the disease in the exposed that can be attributed to exposure.

113
00:15:28,123 --> 00:15:39,123
Assuming the relationship is causal. So the attributable risk person, you can calculate a couple different ways.

114
00:15:39,123 --> 00:15:50,123
One good way to do it is you can use the risk ratio minus one over the risk ratio, which we already have, or.

115
00:15:50,123 --> 00:16:01,123
The. The risk and exposed over the risks difference.

116
00:16:01,123 --> 00:16:09,123
But let's use the first formula. It's kind of easier. One point five minus one over one point five.

117
00:16:09,123 --> 00:16:14,123
And that's equal to a third.

118
00:16:14,123 --> 00:16:25,123
So we can say a third, assuming the relationship is causal. About a third of the disease and the exposed population can be attributed to exposure.

119
00:16:25,123 --> 00:16:36,123
Questioning. Calculate the P r. The P R stands for the population attributable risk.

120
00:16:36,123 --> 00:16:45,123
Not to go one to the risk in the total population, minus the risk and the unexposed population.

121
00:16:45,123 --> 00:16:55,123
You think about it makes sense. We're trying to calculate the proportion of the risk in the entire population that can be attributed to exposure.

122
00:16:55,123 --> 00:17:03,123
So we take the risk and the whole population and subtract out what we know is attributable to not a trivial tool to exposure.

123
00:17:03,123 --> 00:17:19,123
And so we get what's left. So it makes sense in that way. So the risk in the total population is one money plus 60 over two thousand.

124
00:17:19,123 --> 00:17:36,123
Get that information from that to which I try to table. Subtract that from risk and the unexposed, which is 120 over fifteen hundred.

125
00:17:36,123 --> 00:17:49,123
And as a call to go on one or one percent.

126
00:17:49,123 --> 00:17:56,123
Question nine. Which of the following is not a general advantage of cohort studies over other observational designs?

127
00:17:56,123 --> 00:18:01,123
So if we think about it, what are the other observational designs? So we've got EqualLogic studies.

128
00:18:01,123 --> 00:18:04,123
We know those have problems. Haven't really learned too much about those yet.

129
00:18:04,123 --> 00:18:09,123
We've got cross case control studies and we've got cross-sectional studies.

130
00:18:09,123 --> 00:18:14,123
So let's go through each point. So efficient for a rare disease. So remember and cohort study.

131
00:18:14,123 --> 00:18:22,123
You select a group of people typically. And those people are either exposed or unexposed and you follow them forward through time.

132
00:18:22,123 --> 00:18:28,123
So it wouldn't really be good for a rare disease because you would need a lot of people enrolled in your cohort

133
00:18:28,123 --> 00:18:36,123
study in order to get enough cases for your side to be powerful enough to have good statistical precision.

134
00:18:36,123 --> 00:18:45,123
So it's not efficient for a rare disease. So we're not going to we're going to select that one because this answer this question is negatively worded.

135
00:18:45,123 --> 00:18:52,123
Which of the following is not a general advantage? You can better establish the temporal relationship between exposure and outcome.

136
00:18:52,123 --> 00:18:57,123
Now compare a cohort study to a case control study or cross-sectional study.

137
00:18:57,123 --> 00:19:05,123
That is a legitimate merit of the current study because we know that the exposure occurred typically before the outcome occurs,

138
00:19:05,123 --> 00:19:15,123
because we fall followed people forward in time. So we won't slight that one efficient for a disease with a long latency and induction period.

139
00:19:15,123 --> 00:19:22,123
I don't think that's true because of this of similar reasons to the first answer.

140
00:19:22,123 --> 00:19:28,123
We're following people forward in time. And so conversely, if if you've got a disease with a long latency or induction period,

141
00:19:28,123 --> 00:19:34,123
you have to wait a really long time for the exposure to actually cause any of the outcomes.

142
00:19:34,123 --> 00:19:40,123
So let's let that one to. Can be used to study a rare exposure.

143
00:19:40,123 --> 00:19:45,123
That's a legitimate advantage of a cohort study because we can select what we call enriched cohorts.

144
00:19:45,123 --> 00:19:48,123
So if we're trying to study exposure to a rare chemical,

145
00:19:48,123 --> 00:19:53,123
we can select people in a certain community that may or may not have been exposed to a chemical like,

146
00:19:53,123 --> 00:19:58,123
let's say, as we know, it's in some water supplies, but not others.

147
00:19:58,123 --> 00:20:04,123
Or we can select special exposure over it like an occupational exposure cohort.

148
00:20:04,123 --> 00:20:08,123
We want to study something like noise or working with a certain piece of machinery or something.

149
00:20:08,123 --> 00:20:16,123
So that is a legitimate advantage. Next, it is possible to study multiple diseases using one cohort.

150
00:20:16,123 --> 00:20:21,123
Again, a legitimate advantage of a cohort study because we're following people forward in time.

151
00:20:21,123 --> 00:20:26,123
And in fact, many, many large population based cohort sites like the Health or Retirement Study,

152
00:20:26,123 --> 00:20:32,123
the Framingham Heart Study are used to study many outcomes because we collect a wide variety of data.

153
00:20:32,123 --> 00:20:39,123
And so we won't select that either. And so we have these two.

154
00:20:39,123 --> 00:20:44,071
And that's it for today's quiz.
