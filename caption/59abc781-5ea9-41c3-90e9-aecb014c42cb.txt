1
00:00:00,505 --> 00:00:06,467
In this session we'll be talking about Calculating and Interpreting LOD Scores.

2
00:00:06,467 --> 00:00:10,759
Learning Objectives are to Define, Calculate and interpret LOD scores.

3
00:00:10,759 --> 00:00:15,490
And to Evaluate whether a marker is linked to a disease in a family.

4
00:00:15,973 --> 00:00:19,958
In Linkage Analysis we have two hypotheses.

5
00:00:19,958 --> 00:00:24,477
One hypothesis called the null hypothesis is that there's no linkage between

6
00:00:24,477 --> 00:00:27,488
the marker and the disease that you're looking at or

7
00:00:27,488 --> 00:00:30,378
between the two LOD side that you're looking at.

8
00:00:30,378 --> 00:00:37,844
And remember the recombination fraction data associated with no linkage is 0.5.

9
00:00:37,844 --> 00:00:42,005
We're going to compare that hypothesis to what we call H1 or

10
00:00:42,005 --> 00:00:47,404
the alternative hypothesis that there is linkage between those two low side.

11
00:00:47,404 --> 00:00:51,026
And we're gonna evaluate that linkage at a range of theta.

12
00:00:51,026 --> 00:00:55,642
But specifically, we can focus on evaluating it when theta is

13
00:00:55,642 --> 00:00:58,945
equal to the maximum likelihood estimate.

14
00:00:58,945 --> 00:01:00,751
To test the hypothesis.

15
00:01:00,751 --> 00:01:06,785
We're going to use the lod score or the log of the LOD Score.

16
00:01:06,785 --> 00:01:11,794
The LOD Score is evaluated using the log base 10 of

17
00:01:11,794 --> 00:01:12,427
the ratio of the likelihood of seeing that pedigree configuration.

18
00:01:18,562 --> 00:01:21,637
When theta is equal to the MLE compared to the likelihood of seeing

19
00:01:24,591 --> 00:01:28,922
that pedigree configuration when theta equals one-half.

20
00:01:30,193 --> 00:01:35,760
Looking at some examples when we have a pedigree with k

21
00:01:35,760 --> 00:01:42,084
recombinant meosis and n minus k non-recombinant meosis.

22
00:01:42,084 --> 00:01:45,285
The relationships are given in the table below.

23
00:01:45,285 --> 00:01:48,323
If you have a theta greater than 0,

24
00:01:48,323 --> 00:01:52,491
you can evaluate the lods for the log of the odds.

25
00:01:52,491 --> 00:01:53,707
By taking the log base 10 of the probability of

26
00:01:57,012 --> 00:02:01,760
a non-recombinant meosis raised to the number of

27
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:06,736
observed non-recombinant meiosis in the pedigree

28
00:02:06,736 --> 00:02:11,611
times the number of recombination meosis raised.

29
00:02:11,611 --> 00:02:18,274
I'm sorry times the probability of a recombinant meosis raised to the number of

30
00:02:18,274 --> 00:02:20,166
recombinant meosis divided by one-half to the total number of meosis that you see.

31
00:02:25,347 --> 00:02:31,856
So this part is the likelihood of the pedigree under theta equals the MLE.

32
00:02:31,856 --> 00:02:38,044
And this part is the likelihood of the pedigree when theta equals one-half.

33
00:02:38,044 --> 00:02:42,761
We'll take that ratio and take the log base 10 and

34
00:02:42,761 --> 00:02:46,827
that will give us C of theta or our LOD Score.

35
00:02:46,827 --> 00:02:52,565
If you have a situation where you're evaluating theta equals 0 which

36
00:02:52,565 --> 00:02:57,678
is complete linkage and you have no recombinants at all in your data.

37
00:02:58,216 --> 00:03:04,350
If you have a situation where theta equals 0 you're evaluating for complete linkage

38
00:03:04,350 --> 00:03:09,646
but you see at least one recombination in your data that's not possible.

39
00:03:09,646 --> 00:03:14,513
So the Z of theta or the lod score is actually negative infinity

40
00:03:14,513 --> 00:03:17,884
because you can't have a recombination if

41
00:03:17,884 --> 00:03:21,542
there is complete linkage between those two lod sign.

42
00:03:22,205 --> 00:03:28,004
One really nice thing about lod scores is that they can be summed across pedigrees.

43
00:03:28,004 --> 00:03:32,981
So if you're trying to look at say the relationship between the disease and

44
00:03:32,981 --> 00:03:34,688
some marker of interest an individual pedigree will only be able to give you so

45
00:03:38,116 --> 00:03:39,467
much information.

46
00:03:39,467 --> 00:03:43,656
So what you wanna do is you wanna get a collection of pedigrees,

47
00:03:43,656 --> 00:03:47,846
all of which have people who have that disease of interest, and

48
00:03:47,846 --> 00:03:50,455
look at markers in the genome and see for

49
00:03:50,455 --> 00:03:56,016
each marker if it's segregating with the disease in all of the families combined.

50
00:03:56,016 --> 00:04:01,315
And the way you do that is by adding live scores across pedigrees.

51
00:04:01,693 --> 00:04:06,425
The important thing here is when you're adding LOD Scores you

52
00:04:06,425 --> 00:04:10,161
have to evaluate them at the same value of theta.

53
00:04:10,161 --> 00:04:13,195
So you can take the LOD Score for

54
00:04:13,195 --> 00:04:18,680
pedigree 1 at theta equals 0.1 plus the lod score for

55
00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:22,311
pedigree 2 at theta equals 0.1.

56
00:04:22,311 --> 00:04:28,310
You can put those together to accumulate evidence for linkage but

57
00:04:28,310 --> 00:04:33,556
you could never take the lod score pedigree 1 at its MLE.

58
00:04:33,556 --> 00:04:36,570
Let's say it's theta equals 0.1 and

59
00:04:36,570 --> 00:04:42,159
add that to the LOD Score of pedigree 2 at its MLE which might be different.

60
00:04:42,159 --> 00:04:46,948
So let's say it's MLE is 0.2 you can't add those together.

61
00:04:47,745 --> 00:04:50,697
What is the interpretation of lod scores?

62
00:04:50,697 --> 00:04:57,470
Well, we can understand them as actually corresponding to the following odds.

63
00:04:57,470 --> 00:05:05,805
If you have a lod score equal 0 it is equally likely that the no hypothesis and

64
00:05:05,805 --> 00:05:09,855
the alternative hypothesis exist.

65
00:05:09,855 --> 00:05:16,552
So we don't have any evidence for or against linkage.

66
00:05:16,552 --> 00:05:20,560
If you have a LOD Score that's negative that's

67
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:23,623
accumulating evidence against linkage.

68
00:05:24,174 --> 00:05:28,834
So if you have a LOD Score that's negative 2 that

69
00:05:28,834 --> 00:05:33,504
corresponds 100 to1 odds against linkage.

70
00:05:33,504 --> 00:05:38,432
On the other hand if you have a lod score that's positive 2

71
00:05:38,432 --> 00:05:42,128
that's 100 to 1 odds in favor of linkage.

72
00:05:42,364 --> 00:05:45,892
So just remember that lod scores can be positive or negative.

73
00:05:45,892 --> 00:05:48,602
So when we're summing across pedigrees,

74
00:05:48,602 --> 00:05:53,571
it might not be the case that the more pedigrees you have, the more evidence for

75
00:05:53,571 --> 00:05:58,259
linkage you have, you might just accumulate evidence against linkage.

76
00:05:58,259 --> 00:05:58,539
Let's take a look at lod scores across different values of theta.

77
00:06:03,053 --> 00:06:07,614
So here we're looking at the LOD Scores Z of theta and

78
00:06:07,614 --> 00:06:12,395
we're looking at the recombination fraction theta.

79
00:06:12,395 --> 00:06:15,188
So for each pedigree,

80
00:06:15,188 --> 00:06:20,811
we can plot their trajectory using these axes.

81
00:06:21,071 --> 00:06:26,844
So if you have a situation where you're evaluating a marker for its association

82
00:06:26,844 --> 00:06:31,925
with disease and a family and that marker is not linked to the disease,

83
00:06:31,925 --> 00:06:37,306
you'll always get a negative LOD Score no matter what value of theta you use.

84
00:06:37,551 --> 00:06:41,002
So here's where theta is equal to 0.5.

85
00:06:41,002 --> 00:06:45,209
And as you can see when theta gets smaller and smaller.

86
00:06:45,209 --> 00:06:50,759
And so your hypothesis is that the disease and these Locusts are more and

87
00:06:50,759 --> 00:06:55,224
more linked, you get more and more evidence against linkage.

88
00:06:55,674 --> 00:07:03,179
This family is giving you evidence against linkage at every point along this line.

89
00:07:03,325 --> 00:07:05,557
And it gets more and more negative and

90
00:07:05,557 --> 00:07:10,747
it goes to negative infinity because when you evaluate for linkage at theta equal 0.

91
00:07:10,747 --> 00:07:15,651
This line goes infinitely negative because this family

92
00:07:15,651 --> 00:07:19,825
has recombination events in the pedigree, but

93
00:07:19,825 --> 00:07:25,250
a family who actually where the marker is linked to the disease

94
00:07:25,250 --> 00:07:31,717
you can see that if you evaluate that family at different levels of theta,

95
00:07:31,717 --> 00:07:36,867
eventually you reach a point where this line is a maximum.

96
00:07:36,867 --> 00:07:43,934
In this example, this family's maximum likelihood estimate of theta is 0.1.

97
00:07:43,934 --> 00:07:46,050
So in this family the proportion of time that you would see

98
00:07:48,276 --> 00:07:51,721
a recombination event is 10% of the time.

99
00:07:51,721 --> 00:07:56,712
Theta equals 0.1 because the lod score is maximized there.

100
00:07:56,712 --> 00:07:56,935
As you evaluate for tighter and tighter linkage.

101
00:08:01,903 --> 00:08:04,121
This line will also go negative and

102
00:08:04,121 --> 00:08:09,714
will go to negative infinity because there are recombinants in this pedigree as well.

103
00:08:09,714 --> 00:08:13,148
If there were no recombinants,

104
00:08:13,148 --> 00:08:18,234
the line would actually stop at the lod score of n

105
00:08:18,234 --> 00:08:22,808
log 2 which I showed you in the previous slide.

106
00:08:23,336 --> 00:08:26,683
Let's talk about the significance of LOD Scores.

107
00:08:26,683 --> 00:08:31,794
So if you have a lod score that is equal to 3 or more.

108
00:08:31,794 --> 00:08:36,466
The probability of linkage given the results that you have is 1000 times

109
00:08:36,466 --> 00:08:40,121
greater than the probability that the genes are unlinked.

110
00:08:40,121 --> 00:08:44,173
We call this significant evidence in favor of linkage.

111
00:08:44,173 --> 00:08:49,453
So a lod score 3 or more is significantly supporting

112
00:08:49,453 --> 00:08:54,375
linkage and it has a P value of about .0001.

113
00:08:54,375 --> 00:08:58,302
If a LOD Score is less than negative 2,

114
00:08:58,302 --> 00:09:03,424
we call that significantly in favor of no linkage.

115
00:09:03,424 --> 00:09:08,631
If the LOD Score is in between negative 2 and 3,

116
00:09:08,631 --> 00:09:15,626
that is not significant evidence either for or against linkage.

117
00:09:15,626 --> 00:09:20,831
You would need to look at more pedigrees at that same

118
00:09:20,831 --> 00:09:26,050
value of theta in order to get a conclusive result.

119
00:09:26,050 --> 00:09:31,262
These LOD Scores of 3 being significantly in favor of linkage and

120
00:09:31,262 --> 00:09:36,760
negative 2 being significantly in favor of no linkage are standards

121
00:09:36,760 --> 00:09:42,268
that have been set by the field when we started doing linkage studies.

122
00:09:42,374 --> 00:09:45,798
There is a stronger criterion for

123
00:09:45,798 --> 00:09:51,298
linkage because the Z has to be above 3 then no linkage

124
00:09:51,298 --> 00:09:56,081
because the Z only has to be below negative 2.

125
00:09:56,081 --> 00:10:01,632
Because we don't wanna make a mistake where we say yes there's linkage and

126
00:10:01,632 --> 00:10:02,785
we're wrong.

127
00:10:02,785 --> 00:10:07,783
We would much rather make a mistake if we say no it's not linked and be wrong.

128
00:10:07,783 --> 00:10:12,285
So that's why there's a difference in the absolute

129
00:10:12,285 --> 00:10:17,205
values of the lod scores supporting linkage versus not.

130
00:10:17,205 --> 00:10:21,991
Okay, LOD Scores vary with theta.

131
00:10:21,991 --> 00:10:26,808
So as I showed you in the previous graphic you can calculate lod scores in

132
00:10:26,808 --> 00:10:29,377
a pedigree a longer range of thetas and

133
00:10:29,377 --> 00:10:33,968
you will want to find the one that maximizes Z of theta the lod score.

134
00:10:33,968 --> 00:10:39,846
And at that point will be when theta is equal to the MLE.

135
00:10:39,846 --> 00:10:45,644
The LOD Scores also vary with the data, each pedigree gives different information.

136
00:10:45,644 --> 00:10:51,761
And as I mentioned before, the LOD Scores are additive across independent pedigrees.

137
00:10:51,761 --> 00:10:56,522
So we can sum data from all the pedigrees at the same value of theta to get

138
00:10:56,522 --> 00:10:57,825
a final lod score.

139
00:10:59,800 --> 00:11:02,190
Okay, let's do an example.

140
00:11:02,190 --> 00:11:06,718
We're going to look at this disease that's running in this family.

141
00:11:06,718 --> 00:11:10,856
And ask the question is the disease linked to the marker?

142
00:11:11,257 --> 00:11:12,568
This person.

143
00:11:12,568 --> 00:11:19,103
The dad has a bigdilio which is causing the disease and a smalldilio.

144
00:11:19,103 --> 00:11:24,478
And the genotype the marker we're evaluating is 1 2.

145
00:11:24,478 --> 00:11:28,210
The mom has small D, Small D.

146
00:11:28,210 --> 00:11:29,849
And we're evaluating.

147
00:11:29,849 --> 00:11:34,463
And the alleles at the VMTR we're evaluating are 1 1.

148
00:11:34,463 --> 00:11:40,631
So this mom can only pass a small D 1 haplotype to her offspring.

149
00:11:40,631 --> 00:11:44,915
And the dad, we don't know the dad's phase.

150
00:11:44,915 --> 00:11:50,215
So the dad could be big D1 and small D2.

151
00:11:50,215 --> 00:11:53,819
Or big D2 and small D1.

152
00:11:54,102 --> 00:11:56,958
We don't know how those are arranged in the chromosome.

153
00:11:56,958 --> 00:12:00,167
So this pedigree is phase unknown.

154
00:12:00,167 --> 00:12:03,196
We're going to look at these kids and

155
00:12:03,196 --> 00:12:07,796
see what alleles were transmitted to this generation.

156
00:12:10,111 --> 00:12:13,692
So as I mentioned before we don't know the phase and dad.

157
00:12:13,692 --> 00:12:17,141
Okay, what do we do with a phase unknown pedigree?

158
00:12:17,141 --> 00:12:20,825
We have to evaluate it under two scenarios.

159
00:12:20,825 --> 00:12:28,123
So we have to evaluate the pedigree under this scenario we'll call it phase one.

160
00:12:28,123 --> 00:12:32,705
Where the dad has a big D1 haplotype and a small D2.

161
00:12:32,705 --> 00:12:37,288
And we have to evaluate in this scenario where the big D and the 2 allele

162
00:12:37,288 --> 00:12:42,119
are traveling together and the small D and the 1 are traveling together.

163
00:12:42,119 --> 00:12:46,487
So we're gonna take the average of these two likelihoods.

164
00:12:46,487 --> 00:12:51,748
So our likelihood of theta in this pedigree is going to be half

165
00:12:51,748 --> 00:12:57,317
times the likelihood of theta, given that the dad is in phase one

166
00:12:57,317 --> 00:13:03,628
plus half of the likelihood of theta, given that the dad is in phase two.

167
00:13:03,628 --> 00:13:10,508
This is what we will always do when we have phase unknown people in the pedigree.

168
00:13:10,508 --> 00:13:16,796
And how can we compare the probability of linkage, the probability of no linkage?

169
00:13:17,510 --> 00:13:22,727
We're gonna take the ratio of the likelihood of linkage

170
00:13:22,727 --> 00:13:27,722
at the maximum likelihood versus the likelihood of no

171
00:13:27,722 --> 00:13:31,498
linkage where theta is equal to 0.5.

172
00:13:31,498 --> 00:13:35,618
So to calculate theLOD Score, let's look at the phase.

173
00:13:35,618 --> 00:13:40,296
If the dad is in this phase which will call phase 1 then there

174
00:13:40,296 --> 00:13:44,617
are 4 nonrecombinant and 1 recombinant offspring.

175
00:13:44,617 --> 00:13:49,354
So if dad has this configuration, this kid got

176
00:13:49,354 --> 00:13:54,344
a big D1 from the dad and a small D1 from the mom.

177
00:13:54,344 --> 00:13:58,156
And that's consistent because dad has a big D1 to give so

178
00:13:58,156 --> 00:14:00,228
that's a non-recombinant.

179
00:14:00,228 --> 00:14:05,279
This kid got a small D1 from mom and a small D2 from dad.

180
00:14:05,279 --> 00:14:08,783
Those are both parental non-recombinant.

181
00:14:08,783 --> 00:14:11,268
This one got a small D1 from mom and

182
00:14:11,268 --> 00:14:15,819
a small D1 from dad that would need to be have a recombination.

183
00:14:15,819 --> 00:14:19,888
If the dad was in this phase there would need to be a recombination between

184
00:14:19,888 --> 00:14:21,564
the small D and the1 allele.

185
00:14:21,564 --> 00:14:25,940
So this child would be recombinant and these 2 would be non-recombinant.

186
00:14:25,940 --> 00:14:30,855
So you have 4 non-recombinants and 1 recombinant under this phase for dad.

187
00:14:30,855 --> 00:14:35,325
And the likelihood of theta is 1 minus theta to the fourth

188
00:14:35,325 --> 00:14:39,891
because we have 4 meosis that are non-recombinant times

189
00:14:39,891 --> 00:14:44,752
theta to the 1 because we have 1 meosis that is recombinant.

190
00:14:44,752 --> 00:14:49,601
if you evaluate the kids and assuming that dad is in the other phase,

191
00:14:49,601 --> 00:14:52,167
what you'll find is the opposite.

192
00:14:52,167 --> 00:14:55,783
These 4 children The 1st, 2nd, 4th, and

193
00:14:55,783 --> 00:15:00,905
5th will be recombinant and this guy will be non-recombinant.

194
00:15:00,905 --> 00:15:05,910
Because if you look here they've still got a small D1 from mom and

195
00:15:05,910 --> 00:15:11,464
a small D 1 from dad and dad actually in this phase has a small D1 to give.

196
00:15:11,464 --> 00:15:15,208
So the likelihood of theta for this pedigree,

197
00:15:15,208 --> 00:15:19,912
if the phase is this is the probability of recombination or

198
00:15:19,912 --> 00:15:25,672
theta to the fourth because we have 4 recombinant meosis that we see and

199
00:15:25,672 --> 00:15:27,584
1 minus times 1 which is the probability of a non-recombinant meosis.

200
00:15:34,716 --> 00:15:39,660
So we can take those likelihoods which I just showed you at

201
00:15:39,660 --> 00:15:45,019
phase 1 at phase 2 and we can evaluate at some value of theta.

202
00:15:45,019 --> 00:15:48,713
So let's evaluate for theta equals 0.1.

203
00:15:48,713 --> 00:15:54,129
The likelihood in this first phase 1 minus theta to the fourth

204
00:15:54,129 --> 00:15:59,753
times theta would be 1 minus 0.1 to the fourth times 0.1 or

205
00:15:59,753 --> 00:16:02,790
0.9 to the fourth time 0.1.

206
00:16:02,790 --> 00:16:04,916
In phase 2 will do the opposite.

207
00:16:04,916 --> 00:16:09,725
We have theta to the fourth times 1 minus theta which is

208
00:16:09,725 --> 00:16:13,916
this in yellow and then at theta equals 0.5.

209
00:16:13,916 --> 00:16:18,074
We actually know that theta is equal to 1 minus theta.

210
00:16:18,074 --> 00:16:20,247
Both of them equal 0.5.

211
00:16:20,247 --> 00:16:24,626
So the likelihood is 0.5 raised to the number

212
00:16:24,626 --> 00:16:28,903
of informative meosis is 0.5 to the fifth.

213
00:16:28,903 --> 00:16:31,251
Putting that all into the lod score.

214
00:16:31,251 --> 00:16:32,282
Here's what we're gonna do.

215
00:16:32,282 --> 00:16:34,360
We've got the log base 10.

216
00:16:34,360 --> 00:16:38,435
We've got the average of the likelihood under phase 1 and

217
00:16:38,435 --> 00:16:40,693
the likelihood under phase 2.

218
00:16:40,693 --> 00:16:45,318
And then we're dividing that by the theta equals 0.5 raised to

219
00:16:45,318 --> 00:16:47,849
the number of informative meosis.

220
00:16:47,849 --> 00:16:52,041
So we're comparing the likelihood under theta equals 0.1 to

221
00:16:52,041 --> 00:16:55,384
the likelihood that they're unlinked entirely.

222
00:16:55,384 --> 00:17:00,359
And we get the LOD Score 0.0217.

223
00:17:00,374 --> 00:17:04,018
If we calculate for this pedigree,

224
00:17:04,018 --> 00:17:09,969
the likelihood at all of these different values of theta,

225
00:17:09,969 --> 00:17:14,219
this is where we calculate the lod score,

226
00:17:14,219 --> 00:17:21,397
the Z of theta under all of these different potential values of theta.

227
00:17:21,397 --> 00:17:25,847
If you look across the lod score, you can see that it's at negative infinity when

228
00:17:25,847 --> 00:17:29,782
theta equals 0 because we do see potentially recombinant offspring.

229
00:17:29,782 --> 00:17:35,824
And the lod score is highest when theta equals 0.2.

230
00:17:35,824 --> 00:17:42,158
That means that this value of theta 0.2 is the maximum

231
00:17:42,158 --> 00:17:47,827
likelihood estimate of theta for this pedigree.

232
00:17:47,827 --> 00:17:53,706
And the lod score at that maximum likelihood estimate is 0.12.

233
00:17:53,706 --> 00:17:58,320
So that means there's not significant evidence in favor of linkage or

234
00:17:58,320 --> 00:17:59,579
against linkage.

235
00:17:59,579 --> 00:18:05,595
But we can look across other pedigrees at theta equals 0.2 to see if we can increase

236
00:18:05,595 --> 00:18:11,612
this lod score enough to be significant or decrease it enough to be non-significant

237
00:18:11,612 --> 00:18:16,973
evidence of linkage between the disease and the marker we're evaluating.
