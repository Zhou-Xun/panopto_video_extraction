1
00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:06,750
Go ahead and start. Welcome back. I hope everyone had a restful fall break.

2
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:12,060
Uh, we are working on grading the exam.

3
00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:21,209
So. So far, I haven't seen any big red flags in terms of something not being understood or one of the main concepts.

4
00:00:21,210 --> 00:00:27,090
It seems like people are essentially getting most of what I'm talking about based on what I can see so far.

5
00:00:27,100 --> 00:00:33,870
So that's that's a good sign. And then so we'll have one more exam that's the same format as that one and then your term paper.

6
00:00:33,870 --> 00:00:38,640
So that'll be kind of it as far as the rest of the class goes.

7
00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:44,820
Any questions before we jump into the material for today?

8
00:00:47,850 --> 00:00:58,140
Related The paper that we have to do by the end of this semester on November nine, we have to give you our our topics and.

9
00:00:59,860 --> 00:01:09,010
Do we have to write it down like like a brief resume or something related to the topic or just pick up the topic?

10
00:01:09,220 --> 00:01:13,240
No, it could just be a brief. I think I'll have to double check the cabinet site.

11
00:01:13,240 --> 00:01:20,640
But I think where when that assignment it's I think it's already open where you're going to like submit there's like a text box there.

12
00:01:20,650 --> 00:01:26,410
Right. And I think just like in general, just let me know what you're thinking about because that way, you know,

13
00:01:26,410 --> 00:01:34,660
I can kind of start thinking about things, you know, that kind of preparing myself to read what is coming in and kind of on that same note,

14
00:01:34,660 --> 00:01:38,470
if anyone has any questions about a topic they're thinking about,

15
00:01:38,920 --> 00:01:46,990
you're not sure if it's an appropriate combination of toxicant and health outcome or something to that effect.

16
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:51,460
Obviously, just come ask me or email or come to office hours.

17
00:01:52,120 --> 00:01:59,319
So but yeah, I'm not looking for a big long, you know, like a abstract or anything.

18
00:01:59,320 --> 00:02:02,660
Just like, just let me know what your topic is, what topic is like.

19
00:02:04,250 --> 00:02:10,940
Um. Okay, with that, I will just jump into the material.

20
00:02:11,900 --> 00:02:17,240
It has always been some good discussion going last time, so if anyone has any comments or questions,

21
00:02:17,810 --> 00:02:21,860
just raise your hand and we'll we'll talk about whatever you want to talk about.

22
00:02:23,150 --> 00:02:26,430
Um. Okay.

23
00:02:26,440 --> 00:02:31,240
So this is part two, the reproductive and Endocrine Systems Toxicology series of lectures.

24
00:02:31,630 --> 00:02:35,800
Again, this one is kind of near and dear to my heart because this is the field that I work in specifically.

25
00:02:38,410 --> 00:02:42,340
So last lecture, we covered the current systems of endocrine disruption.

26
00:02:42,790 --> 00:02:49,840
And as with a lot of things in this class, it had to be a pretty high level overview of the concepts related to those.

27
00:02:50,650 --> 00:02:56,840
But I think we got the main ideas across there with them at the second half or so.

28
00:02:56,860 --> 00:03:00,580
We started to talk about the actual gonads and gametes.

29
00:03:01,420 --> 00:03:02,800
And that was kind of where we cut off.

30
00:03:02,830 --> 00:03:09,040
So this lecture, I'm not sure if this is going to spill over into part of the third lecture because there is quite a bit of material.

31
00:03:10,090 --> 00:03:18,580
But what I'm going to try to cover in this lecture is sexual differentiation and reproductive development overall as a target of toxicants.

32
00:03:18,970 --> 00:03:23,860
And then we'll talk a little bit more about gonadal function and gonads as a target of toxicants.

33
00:03:25,750 --> 00:03:29,230
So just to kind of pick up where we left off, because it's been a week.

34
00:03:30,130 --> 00:03:35,530
Last time we talked about the gonads, which in the male are the testes and in the female are the ovaries.

35
00:03:36,940 --> 00:03:41,070
And so when we think about the toxicant impacting these origins,

36
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:46,810
the some of the major functions of the body that could be affected by a toxicant damaging these organs

37
00:03:47,110 --> 00:03:54,100
are things like gamete production and what of the gametes to someone was tell me what the gametes are.

38
00:03:56,710 --> 00:04:00,100
Two things. There's one that comes from the testes, one that comes from the ovary.

39
00:04:01,670 --> 00:04:09,550
They are. These sperms from the testes and the ovum or the egg from the ovary.

40
00:04:10,300 --> 00:04:16,540
So. And those are the two, you know. So those are essentially fuzed together.

41
00:04:17,080 --> 00:04:23,050
Fertilization as part of the reproductive process. And then the other main function of the gonads.

42
00:04:23,530 --> 00:04:32,469
If you damage the gonads, one of their main functions is the production of sex, sex, steroid hormones, which drive a lot of processes in the body.

43
00:04:32,470 --> 00:04:38,920
And so toxic an injury to these organs can impact that as well and have health effects in that way.

44
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:47,070
So we talked about Silent Spring, which is written by Rachel Carson in the early sixties.

45
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:55,380
And then in the mid-nineties we had this other book that also covered endocrine disruption called Our Stolen Future.

46
00:04:55,830 --> 00:05:02,070
And then we actually brought this up last time was this newer book that came out in 2020 by Shanna Swan.

47
00:05:03,270 --> 00:05:06,900
It's been researching reproductive health for decades.

48
00:05:07,830 --> 00:05:14,219
Her book that just came out called Countdown. And the Countdown in this book is referring mostly to sperm count.

49
00:05:14,220 --> 00:05:21,990
Right? So we're seeing these declines in sperm count globally based on a number of epidemiology studies that have been published and shot.

50
00:05:21,990 --> 00:05:31,080
A lot has been kind of at the forefront of a lot of that research. And we talked about last time about sperm of toxicity,

51
00:05:32,520 --> 00:05:41,190
about how things like a chemical exposure could lead to decreased sperm count or impact on the ability of the testes to produce more sperm.

52
00:05:41,910 --> 00:05:46,710
Impact of a toxicant could potentially impact the ability of the sperm to swim or move.

53
00:05:49,020 --> 00:05:53,620
And it could. And I showed an example this of a chemical impacting the shape of the sperm.

54
00:05:53,640 --> 00:05:57,630
So they have this like kinked tails or malformed heads and things like that.

55
00:05:58,500 --> 00:06:00,690
And this is your kind of typical sperm shape here.

56
00:06:03,170 --> 00:06:12,140
So some of the things that are actually highlighted in Dr. Swan's book are, you know, used to sort of make this case that we have this like,

57
00:06:13,190 --> 00:06:21,470
you know, concerned about impacts on sperm quality and quantity, relate to these factors that we use to evaluate sperm quality.

58
00:06:21,480 --> 00:06:30,500
So one thing we can look at of sperm count is like the concentration of the sperm per usually reported as millions of sperm per milliliter of semen,

59
00:06:30,500 --> 00:06:39,730
for example, the vitality, the percent of live sperm in a given sample, the ability of the sperm to move as as as I said, and morphology.

60
00:06:39,740 --> 00:06:45,110
So these are all things that are part of the quality of the sperm and are going to essentially give us

61
00:06:45,110 --> 00:06:52,220
an idea about how likely an organism is to like reproduce and how the successful fertilization event.

62
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:57,350
So just to like talk about some baseline like numbers here.

63
00:06:57,470 --> 00:07:03,710
Normal sperm concentration ranges from about 15 to 200 million sperm per milliliter of semen.

64
00:07:04,910 --> 00:07:12,500
The World Health Organization classifies anything less than 15 million per milliliter to be low sperm counts.

65
00:07:14,920 --> 00:07:18,430
And so we can also look at things like the ability of a sperm to swim, though.

66
00:07:18,440 --> 00:07:24,610
So we have like standards for what we think about in terms of how fast the sperm moves,

67
00:07:25,300 --> 00:07:29,500
in terms of its likelihood to produce like a fertilization of that.

68
00:07:29,530 --> 00:07:35,079
So, for instance, sperm that move less than 25 millimeters per second, like under a microscope.

69
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:41,950
And if you measure this stuff under a microscope is considered like not likely to produce a successful pregnancy.

70
00:07:43,640 --> 00:07:48,350
So and this is what's laid out in Dr. Swan's book that based on these criteria there appears

71
00:07:48,350 --> 00:07:53,330
to be a global trend of decreasing sperm quality across basically all of these parameters.

72
00:07:56,140 --> 00:07:57,550
And here's some examples, right?

73
00:07:57,560 --> 00:08:05,200
So the W.H.O. or the World Health Organization has actually, over time lowered what they considered the criteria for low sperm count.

74
00:08:06,040 --> 00:08:13,690
It was lowered from 40 million to 20 million around 1980 and then down to the 15 million mark that I just discussed in 2010.

75
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:17,500
So they've kind of been based on the average sperm counts that we're seeing.

76
00:08:17,500 --> 00:08:21,360
They're kind of saying, okay, well, the average is here and what we consider low is here.

77
00:08:21,370 --> 00:08:26,800
So it's kind of like changing with the times that we're noticing these kind of concerning trends.

78
00:08:28,470 --> 00:08:32,250
Compared to like the 1940s, we are seeing numbers like 60 million per bill.

79
00:08:35,580 --> 00:08:39,000
So other things that doctor saw points to in her book.

80
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:44,310
You know, she talks about men that are donating sperm to sperm banks.

81
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:50,190
So the sperm that are donated are need to meet certain criteria, like the ones I just talked about.

82
00:08:51,720 --> 00:09:03,270
And she points to a study in 2016 that where they took samples both at 2023 and 2013, and the percentage of sperm donors whose sperm quality,

83
00:09:03,390 --> 00:09:15,450
so to speak, made the cut, that that percentage went down from about 70% to like 40, 45% or so between, you know, in ten years.

84
00:09:15,870 --> 00:09:18,810
So it's pretty kind of a short time frame in terms of some of these, you know,

85
00:09:19,110 --> 00:09:27,610
when we talk about some of these trends and this didn't appear to be explained by things like alcohol use, which can affect sperm quality,

86
00:09:27,640 --> 00:09:34,680
sperm count, smoking, body weight, etc., some of these other sort of lifestyle factors or other health factors that can impact sperm

87
00:09:34,680 --> 00:09:42,030
health because there's actually an improvement in that stuff between the two from 2003 to 2013.

88
00:09:42,510 --> 00:09:48,210
So it doesn't seem like that was explaining this impact in lower sperm quality.

89
00:09:48,870 --> 00:09:54,750
So one alternate explanation would be exposure to something in the environment.

90
00:09:55,130 --> 00:10:01,430
You know, some of these chemicals we talk about in this class. But there are other explanations as well.

91
00:10:03,080 --> 00:10:09,500
So, you know, we still don't understand the entire picture, but that's certainly a very compelling potential explanation.

92
00:10:14,090 --> 00:10:19,190
And she also notes in that book we're seeing effects on female reproductive endpoints as well.

93
00:10:19,220 --> 00:10:25,820
It's not quite as dramatic. Based on the data we have right now as what we see with like the sperm quality stuff.

94
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:31,700
But it's important to note that there are male or female reproductive health endpoints that we're seeing impacts on.

95
00:10:32,690 --> 00:10:37,070
So we're seeing things like girls experiencing puberty earlier in some parts of the world.

96
00:10:37,080 --> 00:10:42,170
You know, you see these studies coming out of epidemiology, studies of girls going into puberty earlier.

97
00:10:42,980 --> 00:10:50,330
And what this indicates is there may be some kind of impact on the hormonal systems, you know, because this is regulated by the endocrine system.

98
00:10:51,460 --> 00:10:59,810
Um, and beyond that, there's actually a really, like a very real health endpoint attached to that phenomenon because early

99
00:10:59,810 --> 00:11:04,790
puberty is associated with adverse outcomes like breast and endometrial cancers.

100
00:11:05,750 --> 00:11:12,560
So this is also a public health issue and causes a degree of concern.

101
00:11:13,280 --> 00:11:16,009
We're seeing increases in things like endometriosis,

102
00:11:16,010 --> 00:11:22,700
and this is a type of tissue that usually grows in the uterus, but it can grow in other parts of the body.

103
00:11:22,710 --> 00:11:28,970
And when we see that, that's considered that's associated with a host of health problems as well.

104
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:38,780
Um, so we have ovarian reserve, so we have these basically the supply of ovaries that, that, that females have seems to have decreased.

105
00:11:38,780 --> 00:11:46,160
So this a similar to the sperm count phenomenon. And so we're seeing a diminished ovarian reserve from 2004 to 2011,

106
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:52,170
some studies showing increases in recurrent miscarriages over the past few decades.

107
00:11:52,190 --> 00:11:59,479
So there's, you know, not to be it's kind of a doom and gloom kind of set of slides.

108
00:11:59,480 --> 00:12:06,380
But this is just to highlight and set the stakes for why we're interested in these phenomena and why we really want to understand what's going on.

109
00:12:06,940 --> 00:12:12,710
Um, so back to the gonads as a target of toxicants.

110
00:12:13,950 --> 00:12:26,740
Any questions so far? So we talked about mutagenesis and actually found another slide that I think actually illustrates this even better.

111
00:12:26,750 --> 00:12:35,810
So just to talk about this one more time, so give me the genesis is what gives rise to the sperm or the egg, right.

112
00:12:37,010 --> 00:12:42,080
The gametes. And so you have male give me the genesis on this side and then female give me the genesis on this side.

113
00:12:42,590 --> 00:12:47,630
And we the process of developing is gametes.

114
00:12:48,740 --> 00:12:55,250
This arises through this, these two rounds of meiosis that are shown through this series of pictures here.

115
00:12:55,670 --> 00:13:01,670
So you have your pairing up of your chromosomes. You have your maternal chromosome and your paternal chromosome.

116
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:09,780
We get these chromosomes that form what are called sister chromatids, where they double their genetic their DNA.

117
00:13:11,590 --> 00:13:16,450
And then you get these crossing over events between the paternal and maternal chromosomes.

118
00:13:18,520 --> 00:13:27,220
And then you get two rounds of cell division, which so you get one round of cell division in which one chromosome goes to one,

119
00:13:27,460 --> 00:13:32,350
one replica replicated cell and the other one goes to the the also the other replicated cell.

120
00:13:32,710 --> 00:13:36,160
And then those chromatids get pulled apart for the second round of cell division.

121
00:13:36,640 --> 00:13:41,020
And that's what gives rise to the four haploid sperm.

122
00:13:41,030 --> 00:13:49,329
So they have 23 chromosomes. So. So you go from one cell to four cells in the case of the formation of sperm in female can be two.

123
00:13:49,330 --> 00:13:50,620
Genesis It's different.

124
00:13:50,620 --> 00:14:04,060
You go from one diploid cell which has two pairs of chromosomes to one haploid cell with one set of sorry, one set of chromosomes, right?

125
00:14:04,330 --> 00:14:09,309
And instead of making equivalent cells with these cell divisions,

126
00:14:09,310 --> 00:14:15,940
in the case of the development of the the ovum or the egg, you're instead of making equivalent cells,

127
00:14:15,940 --> 00:14:20,259
you get the formation of these things called polar bodies, which, as far as we know,

128
00:14:20,260 --> 00:14:24,250
just kind of degenerate, don't play much of a role in reproduction.

129
00:14:25,070 --> 00:14:32,620
So that's just, again, to highlight the differences between male the male formation of the gamete and the female formation of the can.

130
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:42,080
So there's some really pretty distinct phenomena in both those cases, even though you have this meiosis process that's occurring for both situations.

131
00:14:45,300 --> 00:14:48,920
So. Spermatogenesis.

132
00:14:51,520 --> 00:14:58,240
So males are born with what are called Super Patagonia, which are basically the sperm stem cell population.

133
00:14:59,520 --> 00:15:09,630
And so that's pictured here in this cartoon. And these for medical you can essentially divide to produce more sporadic Monia or differentiate

134
00:15:10,080 --> 00:15:16,650
into the sperm out of sites the sperm and eventually the spermatozoa in a fully formed sperm.

135
00:15:16,670 --> 00:15:21,540
Right. The sperm medical near the stem cell population can be replenished throughout life.

136
00:15:22,530 --> 00:15:29,580
So you have the store in the case of the male of the stem cells that keep replenishing the supply of sperm.

137
00:15:30,510 --> 00:15:36,210
So spermatogenesis begins at puberty. Once it begins, it just keeps going throughout life.

138
00:15:38,370 --> 00:15:41,120
So you get the sperm production that continues throughout the adult lifetime.

139
00:15:41,130 --> 00:15:47,040
And we'll talk about how that's distinct from the case of O Genesis and the formation of the the oocytes.

140
00:15:49,750 --> 00:15:52,990
In terms of toxic effects on the sperm.

141
00:15:53,770 --> 00:16:03,729
This phenomenon of the sperm, Patagonia versus the sperm at of sites that differentiated cells is important to bear in mind because if a toxicant,

142
00:16:03,730 --> 00:16:07,450
let's say I don't know, is pulling a toxicant out of this out of the air like arsenic.

143
00:16:07,450 --> 00:16:10,120
Right. Causes apoptosis in a lot of cells.

144
00:16:10,750 --> 00:16:16,720
If someone is exposed to arsenic and it's causing apoptosis in one of these stages of the differentiation pathway,

145
00:16:18,760 --> 00:16:20,979
if you take away the exposure to that chemical,

146
00:16:20,980 --> 00:16:29,890
you could potentially reverse the effects and recover your sperm cell population because you have it impacted your store of stem cells,

147
00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:40,239
your sporadic Ionia. So if those aren't affected and you take away the toxic toxicity, your exposure, you could over time replenish your sperm.

148
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:43,500
Your sperm count could theoretically go back up to normal.

149
00:16:43,510 --> 00:16:47,870
Right. However, if this format of GONYEA are the target of toxicity,

150
00:16:47,870 --> 00:16:53,780
then you're impacting your main store like your backup supply, if you will, of sperm cells.

151
00:16:54,230 --> 00:17:01,250
And in that case, you might be thinking about you might be finding a case of permanent sterility or a permanent case of permanent low sperm count.

152
00:17:02,330 --> 00:17:09,580
So this is a critical cell type. Yeah.

153
00:17:09,620 --> 00:17:13,530
So you could keep producing viable germ cells if you still have a population of super medical.

154
00:17:16,820 --> 00:17:22,309
And we have an example of a sad example from workers that were exposed to a

155
00:17:22,310 --> 00:17:29,330
pesticide with this long name one to die bromo three chloro propane or DBP.

156
00:17:33,610 --> 00:17:42,310
So it was found that DBP exposure reduced or eliminated sperm in a group of men working in a pesticide factory like manufacturing this chemical.

157
00:17:43,980 --> 00:17:48,120
And when they looked at testicular biopsies, they saw that there was a complete loss of the sperm, Patagonia.

158
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:56,730
And another sort of point of evidence was that sperm count was inversely correlated with years of working at the plant.

159
00:17:57,420 --> 00:18:02,760
So what does that mean? It means the longer they were working there, the lower the sperm count was.

160
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:11,200
There's actually a film that I have not seen, but there's like a documentary film about this called Song of the Canary.

161
00:18:13,180 --> 00:18:18,000
So it was found, you know, long story short, has found that this chemical damages the DNA of this paramedic.

162
00:18:18,010 --> 00:18:21,190
Tony also talked about how destructive DNA damage can be.

163
00:18:21,700 --> 00:18:29,260
And this resulted insult salt that this for medic donia and these workers were like, you know permanently impaired in fertility.

164
00:18:30,040 --> 00:18:32,529
So very sad sad case.

165
00:18:32,530 --> 00:18:39,430
And this is why we take the stuff, you know, why it's a really important public health issue when chemicals are impacting these on points.

166
00:18:41,830 --> 00:18:51,400
So that's one example. Really jump into on the female side of things the process of ovulation and the ovaries as an origin.

167
00:18:51,880 --> 00:18:55,800
Because we've talked about the testes a good amount and we're going to talk about O Genesis, right?

168
00:18:55,810 --> 00:19:03,610
So here's a cartoon picture of the ovaries and you'll see it kind of place within like the fallopian tubes are here.

169
00:19:03,610 --> 00:19:08,839
The uterus is here, right? So this is the over.

170
00:19:08,840 --> 00:19:17,760
The ovaries are. And just to like, you know, maybe just highlight the process of fertilization.

171
00:19:18,620 --> 00:19:24,689
I'm not sure how familiar everyone is of this, but, um, essentially the eggs are released from the ovaries.

172
00:19:24,690 --> 00:19:31,110
They travel down the fallopian tube. The sperm will then find their way into the fallopian tube where fertilization will occur.

173
00:19:31,800 --> 00:19:35,550
And then this fertilized egg will essentially, over the next few days,

174
00:19:36,150 --> 00:19:40,500
travel down the fallopian tube and implant and essentially implant into the wall of the uterus.

175
00:19:40,740 --> 00:19:48,870
And that's where you start to get the formation of the placenta and the growth of the embryo in the fetus and then on from there.

176
00:19:49,680 --> 00:19:56,880
Right. So just to orient everyone to those are some of the main processes of fertilization that will kind of sit on in this talk.

177
00:20:00,540 --> 00:20:05,640
So just some quick notes about ovulation and or Genesis.

178
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:09,330
Females are born with about 1 million. Oocytes are eggs.

179
00:20:11,130 --> 00:20:15,240
Ovulation is the process of releasing an old site into the fallopian tubes so the

180
00:20:15,240 --> 00:20:18,810
oldest can be released into the fallopian tube and be fertilized or not fertilized.

181
00:20:19,340 --> 00:20:25,860
So, you know, it's not that every every egg or every also does not undergo fertilization.

182
00:20:28,800 --> 00:20:34,290
So, you know, this cycle of ovulation, this you know, this is what we think of as what we call a menstrual cycle.

183
00:20:35,100 --> 00:20:41,070
What happens here is about 10 to 20 eggs begin sort of developing and maturing,

184
00:20:41,640 --> 00:20:45,690
but only one actually matures completely and gets released into the fallopian tube.

185
00:20:46,800 --> 00:20:50,000
And then again, either fertilization can occur or not occur.

186
00:20:53,110 --> 00:20:56,530
And we'll talk about what that felt like a little bit about what that for. I'm sorry.

187
00:20:56,560 --> 00:21:03,980
What that. Mature maturation process kind of looks like in another in a slide coming up here.

188
00:21:05,710 --> 00:21:11,430
But you know, we've all heard of like the menstrual cycle and things. And, you know, it's important to understand that there's, you know,

189
00:21:11,470 --> 00:21:16,360
different a lot of like important changes that are occurring in the body across during the cycle.

190
00:21:16,360 --> 00:21:19,750
And so some of them this is just taken from Wikipedia, but I think it's a pretty good image.

191
00:21:22,990 --> 00:21:28,180
Like things like, you know, body temperature, for example, can kind of fluctuate a little bit across the cycle.

192
00:21:28,510 --> 00:21:30,850
Things like some of the hormone hormones that we've talked about,

193
00:21:30,850 --> 00:21:36,310
you see this like dynamics of these hormones kind of spiking and going back down across the cycle.

194
00:21:36,760 --> 00:21:41,440
And then this is a cartoon depicting the development and the release of the oocyte.

195
00:21:41,740 --> 00:21:45,790
And then there's actually, you know, some events after its release that are kind of important as well.

196
00:21:46,540 --> 00:21:48,459
And then you have, you know, we're not going to go into all of this,

197
00:21:48,460 --> 00:21:54,790
but you have like the menses, the buildup of tissues that can get released once per cycle.

198
00:21:54,790 --> 00:21:58,680
And, you know, so that's just kind of setting the stage for that.

199
00:21:58,690 --> 00:22:05,469
I mean, this is like just really fascinating biology. You can really, you know, talk about this for multiple courses.

200
00:22:05,470 --> 00:22:16,330
But, um, so the maturation and release of the whole site is depicted here.

201
00:22:16,540 --> 00:22:18,400
This is kind of the main points here, right?

202
00:22:18,970 --> 00:22:27,640
So we haven't, we haven't all the site or a maturing egg here that's surrounded by a structure called a follicle, basically like a.

203
00:22:28,910 --> 00:22:33,560
Like a structure that just sort of surrounds the whole site with with multiple cells.

204
00:22:34,160 --> 00:22:37,700
And this is similar to how, at least to my mind,

205
00:22:37,700 --> 00:22:44,509
how the super bada sites are sort of supported as they differentiate and develop into fully formed sperm by

206
00:22:44,510 --> 00:22:49,219
this are totally cells to kind of in close proximity to each other this they're totally cells are like close

207
00:22:49,220 --> 00:22:54,770
proximity to the sperm out of sites and help them as they're going along their process of differentiation the

208
00:22:54,770 --> 00:23:02,780
follicles a similar thing to my mind in terms of like supporting the oocyte as it's maturing and developing.

209
00:23:03,290 --> 00:23:08,869
And then, you know, there's a few different structures and things and events here that we're not going to have time to get into.

210
00:23:08,870 --> 00:23:14,720
But the main point is that eventually this ovum gets released into the fallopian tube.

211
00:23:15,790 --> 00:23:25,209
And another important point is that the follicle after the egg gets released, it doesn't just like degenerate.

212
00:23:25,210 --> 00:23:34,360
It actually turns into like a different structure called the Corpus Lithium, which is active and supplying hormones in the event of like, say,

213
00:23:34,360 --> 00:23:43,089
fertilization, it's going to supply like some of that hormone signaling that helps this this blastocyst and this embryo or eventually this fetus.

214
00:23:43,090 --> 00:23:49,299
Like it'll start to go on the path towards development into an organism.

215
00:23:49,300 --> 00:23:55,120
Right. So I'll stop right there as any questions to some extent so far.

216
00:23:56,530 --> 00:24:01,649
Okay, cool. Yeah.

217
00:24:01,650 --> 00:24:04,800
So this is just kind of what I just talked about regarding the follicles,

218
00:24:05,700 --> 00:24:12,690
the follicular cells they like surround the oocyte and they synthesize hormones like estrogen and progesterone and androgen.

219
00:24:12,810 --> 00:24:18,660
Right. Oh yeah.

220
00:24:19,120 --> 00:24:27,180
Single oocyte per follicle. And I think I briefly mentioned this last time.

221
00:24:27,450 --> 00:24:35,790
So when we're talking about Biogenesis, the development of these all sites that will eventually be released into the fallopian tube,

222
00:24:36,930 --> 00:24:41,190
this process is more of a start and stop process. Remember, I talked about Spermatogenesis?

223
00:24:41,670 --> 00:24:45,300
It kind of it's turned on puberty and just keeps going for the rest of the lifetime.

224
00:24:45,810 --> 00:24:52,230
But things are a little bit more it's a little bit more nuanced in how the genesis works.

225
00:24:52,260 --> 00:24:57,750
So initially, you have your stem cells, the organism, as opposed to the sperm, Patagonia.

226
00:24:58,870 --> 00:25:04,059
And prenatally so in utero those Ogoni Yeah.

227
00:25:04,060 --> 00:25:11,200
So they're going to proliferate and you're going to get your store of all your organism and then again prenatally and in utero,

228
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:15,460
they're going to progress and they're going to differentiate into the primary oocytes.

229
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:22,390
And so that's a difference between the male and female case. In the female case, you do not have the store of the stem cells.

230
00:25:23,260 --> 00:25:30,790
The males have the sporadic odium, the organism of all sort of like differentiate into these oocytes in utero.

231
00:25:31,030 --> 00:25:34,990
So it's already happened by the time an individual is born.

232
00:25:36,100 --> 00:25:41,620
And so they start their meiosis process and then they kind of like put a pause on it again in utero.

233
00:25:41,620 --> 00:25:49,480
So they start these, these all of a sudden start differentiating and undergoing their differentiation pathway into being a fully functional gamete.

234
00:25:50,110 --> 00:25:55,760
They start that process and then hit the pause button. And then it starts up again around puberty.

235
00:25:57,050 --> 00:26:01,700
And so let's see. So this would be all before birth, right?

236
00:26:01,700 --> 00:26:05,929
So you have your Oregonian dividing and proliferating,

237
00:26:05,930 --> 00:26:11,690
and then they differentiate into this primary goal site, and then you essentially hit the pause button.

238
00:26:13,940 --> 00:26:17,329
Let's see. Yeah.

239
00:26:17,330 --> 00:26:22,100
And then it's things start up again right around puberty just before the first ovulation occurs,

240
00:26:24,200 --> 00:26:32,240
and then the pause button is hit again and it doesn't start up again to complete that process of meiosis unless a fertilization event occurs.

241
00:26:32,810 --> 00:26:38,210
So it's kind of stuck and it's not going to do the rest of that differentiation unless fertilization happens.

242
00:26:40,280 --> 00:26:44,989
So does that make sense? So you have this like these pause situations that happened before this.

243
00:26:44,990 --> 00:26:54,140
The whole process starts again in terms of the development of these oversights into like a full, fully sort of functional egg, if you will.

244
00:26:54,980 --> 00:26:59,090
So this is quite different than the male case where it's just head starts of puberty.

245
00:26:59,090 --> 00:27:06,730
It just keeps going. So this is basically kind of what I just talked through.

246
00:27:06,740 --> 00:27:10,410
So again, and this is important for toxic effects, right?

247
00:27:10,430 --> 00:27:19,100
So toxic impacts. So, you know, depleting the stores of old sodium can have a really big impact on the ability of individuals to, you know,

248
00:27:19,100 --> 00:27:25,340
get, you know, have successful pregnancies later in life because there's these early events that occur in utero.

249
00:27:26,060 --> 00:27:29,570
And when the oocytes are sort of developing and differentiating.

250
00:27:30,380 --> 00:27:37,160
So female babies do not have a large and distinct damaged stem cell population like we do with the male situation.

251
00:27:38,440 --> 00:27:47,620
We have the start and stop process in the case of, oh, Genesis. You know, another one is this, um, once you complete Genesis,

252
00:27:47,620 --> 00:27:53,679
you've gone from one single primary oocyte to only one gamete as opposed to the male situation.

253
00:27:53,680 --> 00:27:56,800
You're going from 1 to 4 gametes.

254
00:27:59,690 --> 00:28:07,590
Any of these productions, of these polar bodies in the female case, and then this old genesis as opposed to the male situation, it stops.

255
00:28:07,610 --> 00:28:07,910
Right.

256
00:28:08,360 --> 00:28:14,990
And so typically, you know, we think we call this either menopause or reproductive senescence, where this whole Genesis process eventually starts.

257
00:28:19,790 --> 00:28:25,910
And so each one of these stages that I talked about and I don't think I necessarily need to read through all of these,

258
00:28:26,840 --> 00:28:31,350
represents like a critical stage that could be impacted by intoxicants.

259
00:28:31,370 --> 00:28:37,060
If you can think about it's like your store of well your Ogoni of for example are proliferating.

260
00:28:37,070 --> 00:28:47,809
If you're if a chemical exposure leads to a lot of apoptosis of those Ogoni then that's going to set how many all of sites that have at later stages.

261
00:28:47,810 --> 00:28:54,050
Right. So earlier events can have effects later in life if they occur during certain

262
00:28:54,980 --> 00:28:58,970
critical stages of a product during this process of holistic development.

263
00:29:02,100 --> 00:29:07,590
So yeah, I won't I won't go over all this again. But yeah, you can you can read that.

264
00:29:08,790 --> 00:29:12,869
So, you know, DNA damage comes into play here a lot.

265
00:29:12,870 --> 00:29:20,640
So damage also DNA can, you know, again, just deplete the storm oocytes if it's if you get a severe enough impact,

266
00:29:21,030 --> 00:29:23,340
you know, you're talking about something like sterility, right?

267
00:29:24,090 --> 00:29:30,120
Or another way this manifests is you can see early onset of menopause or early reproductive senescence.

268
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:36,560
This example of a chemical that's used in rubber production where individuals are exposed.

269
00:29:37,340 --> 00:29:41,470
It was found that this chemical was metabolized to a DNA damaging impact side.

270
00:29:41,510 --> 00:29:47,720
Remember it oxides one of those really reactive types of chemicals that can really damage DNA.

271
00:29:48,650 --> 00:29:52,760
And it was you know, so it was metabolized to this DNA damaging impact side.

272
00:29:53,270 --> 00:29:59,149
And what what they saw was selective depletion of oocytes in some of the follicles as this

273
00:29:59,150 --> 00:30:03,190
like DNA damage was causing your cells to undergo a pap ptosis because the cells are saying,

274
00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:10,400
oh, that's damaged damaged DNA would need to basically undergo this process of directed cell death.

275
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:21,020
And so that's obviously going to impact the ability for those individuals to reproduce or have a successful pregnancy.

276
00:30:24,080 --> 00:30:32,110
And here's an example of where we get this appears to manifest as premature reproductive senescence.

277
00:30:32,120 --> 00:30:33,920
So this is a case of cigaret smoke.

278
00:30:34,880 --> 00:30:43,790
So we see studies that show that women who smoke had a decreased age of when their menopause was the onset of menopause.

279
00:30:43,790 --> 00:30:49,609
Right. So you can see this curve of individuals, of people going through menopause.

280
00:30:49,610 --> 00:30:55,250
And the nonsmoker looks like, you know, there's a range of ages at which women are going through menopause.

281
00:30:55,820 --> 00:31:00,710
But you can see overall, as you increase the number of packs per day that they're smoking,

282
00:31:01,040 --> 00:31:05,240
the overall sort of curve gets shifted to earlier and earlier time points.

283
00:31:05,900 --> 00:31:09,580
Right. So it's kind of a this kind of it's kind of like a dose response, right?

284
00:31:10,370 --> 00:31:13,849
Kind of with one pack a day shifting it a little bit and two packs are more of

285
00:31:13,850 --> 00:31:17,870
shifting it even more so where they're undergoing menopause at earlier stages.

286
00:31:20,330 --> 00:31:23,899
It's thought that one of the main factors, you know,

287
00:31:23,900 --> 00:31:29,450
the component within the cigaret smoke that might be causing this are these polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons,

288
00:31:30,080 --> 00:31:40,490
which we've talked about a couple of times in this class of these patches are metabolized again to denatured DNA, damaging metabolites.

289
00:31:40,580 --> 00:31:46,880
So they're messing up the DNA and breaking the DNA, leading to, you know,

290
00:31:47,150 --> 00:31:52,550
probably death in the specific cell population of the all the sites are all going.

291
00:31:54,050 --> 00:31:56,300
We're not all going. Him in this case will be holsten's.

292
00:31:57,920 --> 00:32:04,360
And so we could back this up with animal studies that show pages deplete primary oocytes in rodents

293
00:32:04,370 --> 00:32:10,220
so it's easier to control the exposure in an animal model than to observe individual smoking.

294
00:32:10,520 --> 00:32:15,110
We could, like, isolate like an actual cage molecule, for example,

295
00:32:15,110 --> 00:32:21,080
and treat rodents with that because there's lots of chemicals that are found in cigaret smoke.

296
00:32:21,260 --> 00:32:27,470
And so finding out which one is actually causing this effect is kind of a challenge, right?

297
00:32:28,490 --> 00:32:35,059
So I kind of like the slide because it kind of shows how you can kind of merge or incorporate

298
00:32:35,060 --> 00:32:40,820
observations in like epidemiology studies with like toxicology studies in order to fully,

299
00:32:41,720 --> 00:32:47,450
you know, more deeply understand the specific mechanism and the specific molecule.

300
00:32:47,480 --> 00:32:56,630
In this case, with the polycyclic polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons causing the specific effect in a specific cell type.

301
00:32:57,140 --> 00:33:00,469
So it's I think it's kind of cool to be able to kind of like look at all of that.

302
00:33:00,470 --> 00:33:05,270
So you kind of can really gain an understanding of what's happening that might be causing this health effect.

303
00:33:08,450 --> 00:33:16,379
APPLAUSE for any comments or questions that are. I think the stuff is really cool.

304
00:33:16,380 --> 00:33:24,990
So I'm just going to like go off and keep talking about it. Summer make sure to pause so I'm okay.

305
00:33:25,710 --> 00:33:29,350
So how are we doing on time? We may get through all the slides.

306
00:33:29,850 --> 00:33:30,270
We'll see.

307
00:33:31,410 --> 00:33:41,790
So the process of sexual differentiation is, you know, as you may already know, is largely driven by hormone and endocrine system signaling.

308
00:33:41,790 --> 00:33:52,680
Right. So in early development, like the early embryo, there is no sex differences that are observed in the gonads.

309
00:33:52,740 --> 00:33:57,060
Right. Male and female embryos kind of look the same.

310
00:33:57,180 --> 00:34:04,700
And we call the structure like the by potential gonad. But after about the six weeks you're starting to get,

311
00:34:05,540 --> 00:34:11,030
you're able to differentiate between the two based on this in some of these structures that you see here.

312
00:34:11,570 --> 00:34:16,219
I mean, this is kind of the internal reproductive tract. So in the case of the female,

313
00:34:16,220 --> 00:34:20,900
eventually what you'll get is arising from this like five potential structure is

314
00:34:21,230 --> 00:34:24,590
the formation of the ovaries and you'll see the formation of the fallopian tubes,

315
00:34:25,550 --> 00:34:30,500
the uterus and the vagina. In the case of the male, you're going to see the development of the testes,

316
00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:35,680
a structure called the epididymis and the vast deferens and several other structures here.

317
00:34:35,690 --> 00:34:39,349
Quite early on, as part of the spine and central gonad,

318
00:34:39,350 --> 00:34:45,050
there's a couple of ducts or just like the tubes called the delirium duct in the Wolfie and duct.

319
00:34:45,620 --> 00:34:48,769
And depending on whether it's a male or female embryo,

320
00:34:48,770 --> 00:34:53,300
you're going to get one or the other of those structures is essentially going to degenerate or go away.

321
00:34:53,450 --> 00:34:58,440
And the other one, it's going to give rise to a lot of the structures of the reproductive tract.

322
00:34:59,930 --> 00:35:06,170
In the case of flow through this in a minute here, in terms of the external genitalia,

323
00:35:07,100 --> 00:35:13,669
you're going to get the formation of your arm and you're going to undergo a similar process of development in the female.

324
00:35:13,670 --> 00:35:16,970
You're going to get the development of the clitoris, the vagina.

325
00:35:17,660 --> 00:35:23,209
In the case of the male, you're getting the development of the the penis and the scrotum and the testes.

326
00:35:23,210 --> 00:35:29,030
Right? You'll see that, you know, we call this like the potential gonads or, you know, because,

327
00:35:29,900 --> 00:35:33,550
you know, you can kind of see that these are arising from like similar structures, right?

328
00:35:33,560 --> 00:35:37,850
It's just kind of like different things are turned on or off in terms of signaling pathways and tissue,

329
00:35:37,850 --> 00:35:42,770
morphology type of pathways along this process of differentiation.

330
00:35:44,800 --> 00:35:48,760
Let's see. What did I want to get on here? Yeah.

331
00:35:48,760 --> 00:35:56,649
So both male and female tissue's expressed androgen receptors and energy receptors, other receptors that the androgens,

332
00:35:56,650 --> 00:36:02,590
like testosterone or the more potent DHT act on and bind those androgen receptors.

333
00:36:03,460 --> 00:36:09,160
The androgens are in large part responsible for the differentiation into the male external genitalia.

334
00:36:10,870 --> 00:36:16,740
We'll talk through some of that here. So when we talk about sex, we can talk about it.

335
00:36:17,070 --> 00:36:22,350
We can talk about it sort of in different biological domains, if you will.

336
00:36:22,680 --> 00:36:27,840
We can talk about the chromosomal sex, which is basically the presence or not of the Y chromosome.

337
00:36:28,170 --> 00:36:35,100
We can talk about the gonadal sex, which is which gonads are, you know, phenotypically associated with an organism.

338
00:36:35,520 --> 00:36:41,459
Or we can talk about phenotypic sex, which is kind of some of the other female typical characteristics that we associate with one or the other.

339
00:36:41,460 --> 00:36:46,970
Sex, right. And this is kind of all on a continuum in some ways when you think about it.

340
00:36:47,750 --> 00:36:53,510
So this is this is a case that's showing the male reproductive tract differentiation.

341
00:36:54,320 --> 00:36:58,100
So this is kind of started by the presence of the Y chromosome.

342
00:36:58,100 --> 00:37:01,550
So instead of an X X for the sex chromosomes, they have an accent, a Y.

343
00:37:02,640 --> 00:37:12,390
And so the the Y chromosome has a region on it called the sex determining region Y gene that produces a protein.

344
00:37:12,840 --> 00:37:16,450
It has a few different names. One of it is called testes determining factor.

345
00:37:16,470 --> 00:37:18,360
So you have the presence of this Y chromosome.

346
00:37:18,660 --> 00:37:27,270
And so because you have that, um, s r y location, you're getting the production of the specific gene that's arising from that Y chromosome.

347
00:37:28,110 --> 00:37:32,340
This testes determining factor stimulates the formation of the testes.

348
00:37:33,520 --> 00:37:41,380
And the testes as they start to form produce testosterone, which is going to continue to look at them as androgen receptors and drive, you know,

349
00:37:41,530 --> 00:37:46,450
some of these other various like structures, both internal and external,

350
00:37:46,450 --> 00:37:53,319
that are forming on that male pathway so that the testes are going to produce testosterone.

351
00:37:53,320 --> 00:37:56,590
And they're also going to produce a chemical called anti-malarial hormone,

352
00:37:57,010 --> 00:38:04,600
which is basically going to prevent those structures that would have developed into the female reproductive tract.

353
00:38:04,630 --> 00:38:09,220
Those will just basically regenerate or go away, not develop along the female tract.

354
00:38:09,940 --> 00:38:14,150
Does that make sense? So there's this continuum of events.

355
00:38:15,300 --> 00:38:22,350
And, you know, theoretically, a chemical toxic could disrupt any one of these events,

356
00:38:23,880 --> 00:38:28,070
you know, damaging the DNA or influencing the testes ability to produce testosterone.

357
00:38:28,080 --> 00:38:33,510
And so that's how a chemical might disrupt reproductive development in the male.

358
00:38:37,520 --> 00:38:43,010
This is just a picture I wanted to show that shows how over time you get sort of this dynamic,

359
00:38:43,670 --> 00:38:47,720
this dynamic levels of like hormones that are produced by the testes.

360
00:38:48,170 --> 00:38:56,040
So like at birth, you have these are different like levels are actually not just hormones but like for instance, proteins like SSRI and testosterone.

361
00:38:56,040 --> 00:39:00,649
There's this like spike that occurs before birth of testosterone and then it kind

362
00:39:00,650 --> 00:39:04,820
of the testosterone levels go down and then kind of spike back up around puberty.

363
00:39:06,290 --> 00:39:11,809
And this testosterone spike here is helping to like cause like a lot of proliferation of these,

364
00:39:11,810 --> 00:39:24,380
like medical linea that are going to eventually be giving your sperm cell supply once, like all those processes are initiated, you're near puberty.

365
00:39:24,530 --> 00:39:30,260
Right. And then here's the anti-malarial hormone, which is like it hits a spike here and then kind of drops off over time.

366
00:39:30,770 --> 00:39:37,849
So these hormonal like levels are really interesting in how they sort of they're, you know, vary across time, across like years.

367
00:39:37,850 --> 00:39:44,569
Right. So this is the female reproductive tract differentiation.

368
00:39:44,570 --> 00:39:48,290
And it's in a lot of ways like just the inverse of what we just saw with the male.

369
00:39:50,360 --> 00:39:56,750
You in this case, when we're talking about things at the chromosomal level, there's no Y chromosome, and so you have no s, r y.

370
00:39:57,790 --> 00:40:01,390
So then you don't do not get the formation of the testes.

371
00:40:01,930 --> 00:40:10,930
And in the absence of that signaling pathway, you get the formation of the ovaries and you also do not get the production of anti-malarial hormone.

372
00:40:11,500 --> 00:40:15,670
So this means that the female reproductive tract that will be allowed to go along,

373
00:40:15,670 --> 00:40:20,530
it's like sort of preprogramed differentiation pathway, if you will.

374
00:40:21,730 --> 00:40:27,340
And in this case, the male it's the male track that fails to survive in the absence of testosterone.

375
00:40:28,360 --> 00:40:32,409
So you see how these are sort of like complementary product processes and that

376
00:40:32,410 --> 00:40:35,940
it's a lot of it's just driven by the presence or not of this Y chromosome.

377
00:40:36,430 --> 00:40:44,140
But there are key events that take the presence of the Y chromosome all the way to, you know, these other events that occur.

378
00:40:44,870 --> 00:40:52,849
Right. Making sense. Yeah.

379
00:40:52,850 --> 00:40:55,460
And this is just showing like what these eventually will turn into.

380
00:40:55,490 --> 00:41:03,200
So like one end of the military index is going to form the fallopian tubes and the other end is going to form like the body of the uterus.

381
00:41:06,110 --> 00:41:10,759
And we talked about D Arthur D E s or die as well.

382
00:41:10,760 --> 00:41:15,020
Still pester all this. It's a really potent synthetic estrogen.

383
00:41:15,140 --> 00:41:20,780
And it was given to pregnant women. It was thought to help with things like recurrent miscarriage or preterm birth.

384
00:41:21,080 --> 00:41:25,700
I believe it was also thought to help with morning sickness associated with pregnancy.

385
00:41:26,360 --> 00:41:32,629
And again, it was later found out to be actually not really good at preventing those things and in fact,

386
00:41:32,630 --> 00:41:41,810
was causing all types of disruption in the female reproductive tract of not only having effects on the individuals taking it,

387
00:41:41,810 --> 00:41:49,280
but the daughters of females that were in utero at the time they grew up to have reproductive tract problems.

388
00:41:49,940 --> 00:41:59,629
So most daughters that were exposed to D in utero had these like this morphogenesis of different aspects of the reproductive tract.

389
00:41:59,630 --> 00:42:06,380
So they had things like an ectopic pregnancy where the, like the blastocyst implants not in the uterus but in the fallopian tube,

390
00:42:06,380 --> 00:42:14,900
which is not compatible with like a successful pregnancy. And, you know, things like abnormal vaginal and cervical epithelium,

391
00:42:14,900 --> 00:42:19,309
like the cells that are lining those tissues were like abnormal, which is you don't want that to be abnormal.

392
00:42:19,310 --> 00:42:30,080
It could lead to the formation of cancers, structural defects in the uterus, like a more constricted uteri, and then again, like cancers.

393
00:42:30,080 --> 00:42:38,510
You know, there's quite a few things like listed here. You know, these are just some of them, this other reproductive effects that we saw as well.

394
00:42:38,510 --> 00:42:49,340
So a very sad case where these daughters grow up to have these impacts after exposure to this really potent and endocrine active chemical.

395
00:42:53,260 --> 00:42:58,479
We also saw and again, you know, I like to point out that there's not this like one or the other all the time.

396
00:42:58,480 --> 00:43:03,820
Like in biology, there's always like a little bit of like bleed over between the males and female cases.

397
00:43:04,600 --> 00:43:09,490
We do see you know, there is some data that suggests that there's disruption in the male reproductive tract as well.

398
00:43:10,240 --> 00:43:11,950
This is a little bit more inconsistent.

399
00:43:12,400 --> 00:43:21,100
But there have been reports that boys, you know, that were like males that were exposed in utero to the US had higher rates of like testicular cancer.

400
00:43:22,090 --> 00:43:24,880
You know, there's some animal studies that show that this might be the case.

401
00:43:25,960 --> 00:43:31,870
You know, increased reproductive tract malformations such as like system, the epididymis or like smaller testes.

402
00:43:32,530 --> 00:43:38,120
So it's not just the females maybe, but it looks like, you know, and it stands to reason that if your you know,

403
00:43:38,140 --> 00:43:40,690
if this is such a potent estrogen, that you might be having effects.

404
00:43:41,200 --> 00:43:48,700
So we talked about how anti androgen chemicals can have some degree of estrogen active activity.

405
00:43:48,710 --> 00:43:54,760
So there's, you know, there's some sort of crosstalk there in terms of how some of these chemicals work.

406
00:43:58,520 --> 00:44:03,320
We talked about this last time. There's this other, more potent version of testosterone called DHT.

407
00:44:05,460 --> 00:44:10,860
That gets converted from testosterone to DHT by an enzyme called five alpha reductase.

408
00:44:12,500 --> 00:44:20,240
And this is, you know, really this is what's what kind of drives a lot of the differentiation in the external genital tissues that the male.

409
00:44:25,990 --> 00:44:29,979
Yeah. This is just kind of the this is just more about the sex differentiation.

410
00:44:29,980 --> 00:44:33,640
I think we have to go over this again necessarily.

411
00:44:34,360 --> 00:44:37,390
Um. Right.

412
00:44:37,420 --> 00:44:47,110
So some of the like birth defects or malformations we see in the male sexual differentiation are what one event is called hyperspeed.

413
00:44:47,950 --> 00:44:51,220
So this is an abnormal positioning of the urethra on the penis.

414
00:44:52,150 --> 00:45:00,220
So these are some examples of different types of hyperspeed ideas where the opening of the urethra is found somewhere else rather than the tip.

415
00:45:00,730 --> 00:45:05,290
And so this occurs with insufficient androgen stimulation.

416
00:45:05,710 --> 00:45:07,300
And we see this of anti-androgen,

417
00:45:07,360 --> 00:45:15,160
particularly in like mammalian like rat models and things we can like causes if we give them anti androgenic compounds or chemicals.

418
00:45:17,940 --> 00:45:24,509
Another one is called crypt organism. So this is when the testes do not descend into the scrotal from the abdomen.

419
00:45:24,510 --> 00:45:29,010
So the testes are usually in the abdomen of early on and then eventually will descend into the scrotum.

420
00:45:29,650 --> 00:45:37,800
And this is also driven by androgen. So testosterone stimulation and anti-androgen chemicals can cause cryptokitties.

421
00:45:40,170 --> 00:45:45,330
And we see that sometimes with like pre-term babies, male babies. And again,

422
00:45:45,450 --> 00:45:49,620
like sometimes you hear about a cure about something and it won't like really

423
00:45:49,620 --> 00:45:52,889
register right away that there's some kind of health effect associated with it.

424
00:45:52,890 --> 00:45:58,709
Such as like the early puberty thing might be like, well, some can maybe think, oh, someone's going through puberty early.

425
00:45:58,710 --> 00:46:04,650
Like, what does that really mean in a health sense? But there are like real health impacts of that similar to this.

426
00:46:04,650 --> 00:46:11,480
This lack of descent in the testes is associated with things like infertility or other, like impaired development process.

427
00:46:11,730 --> 00:46:27,090
Impaired development of the testes. And there's actually this whole field of study looking into some of these phenomena.

428
00:46:28,020 --> 00:46:32,670
Uh, and it's, it's been given the name Testicular Dust, this Genesis syndrome,

429
00:46:33,360 --> 00:46:41,720
which is sort of a description of all of these different processes driven by androgen stimulation that sort of manifest in different ways.

430
00:46:41,730 --> 00:46:47,309
So we have like the hyperspace is, we have the CryptoKitties, you know, there's a couple others.

431
00:46:47,310 --> 00:46:54,810
And it's thought that a lot of this is rooted in impacts on testes development probably early on in,

432
00:46:55,800 --> 00:47:00,600
uh, early in life, like either in utero or maybe, you know, just after birth.

433
00:47:02,870 --> 00:47:06,980
And this may help to explain some of this poor semen quality trends that we're seeing.

434
00:47:07,640 --> 00:47:11,360
So this encompasses things like poor semen, quality testes, cancer.

435
00:47:11,960 --> 00:47:15,350
You know, Burkitt is, um, hyperspeed is, you know,

436
00:47:15,350 --> 00:47:20,580
the general idea is that there's an underlying phenomenon going on that's related to the

437
00:47:21,050 --> 00:47:26,060
formation of the testes and that's essentially getting knocked off track in one way or another.

438
00:47:28,870 --> 00:47:36,310
It's thought that it can be produced by, you know, estrogenic chemicals or anti androgenic chemicals during critical developmental periods.

439
00:47:37,030 --> 00:47:39,610
And so, you know.

440
00:47:41,510 --> 00:47:48,350
The researches that are, you know, looking into this kind of take into account things like there may be genetic contributions to this,

441
00:47:48,350 --> 00:47:52,550
but they're also thinking about endocrine disrupting chemicals and environmental factors.

442
00:47:52,560 --> 00:48:01,550
Right. And you can kind of walk through this and see, you know, so, again, all of this is rooted in the testes, not developing property properly.

443
00:48:02,240 --> 00:48:06,500
And there's a couple of things that can kind of follow from that event.

444
00:48:06,500 --> 00:48:06,770
Right.

445
00:48:06,770 --> 00:48:16,520
So you could have something like disturbed certainly cell function this until these cells play a critical role in germ or sperm cell differentiation.

446
00:48:16,550 --> 00:48:21,200
Right. And so that could lead to something like if you have disturbance or totally cell function,

447
00:48:21,560 --> 00:48:25,760
you could have reduced even quality or even testicular cancer like these cells are

448
00:48:25,760 --> 00:48:29,390
proliferating and not being regulated in terms of how much they're proliferating.

449
00:48:29,720 --> 00:48:37,220
Other types of events like that, a lot of like cell division, maybe some DNA errors are occurring leading to testicular cancer.

450
00:48:40,140 --> 00:48:45,720
So these are a couple of like outcomes that may be rooted into this testicular genesis phenomenon.

451
00:48:46,260 --> 00:48:54,270
But in addition, there's things like the production of hormones, like testosterone leading to things like hyperspace is a crypto organism.

452
00:48:54,510 --> 00:48:55,470
Like I said earlier.

453
00:48:56,430 --> 00:49:04,590
And so the idea here is basically like if you look at each of these, although they're kind of all rooted in the testes in one way or another,

454
00:49:06,090 --> 00:49:11,810
they kind of look almost like at the end, like a different sort of health outcome,

455
00:49:11,820 --> 00:49:17,040
like something like a hyper speedy versus something like reduced semen quality.

456
00:49:17,460 --> 00:49:23,760
You might not be you know, you might not necessarily be thinking those are rooted in a similar cause.

457
00:49:24,510 --> 00:49:35,340
So this is a way of sort of understanding that some of that some of these may be linked to impacts on testes development in that way.

458
00:49:35,370 --> 00:49:37,919
So kind of like tying these things together in a way,

459
00:49:37,920 --> 00:49:42,690
even though they kind of might seem like disparate outcomes when we actually, like, pick them up in a.

460
00:49:43,080 --> 00:49:48,310
Like a. Like an epidemiologist study. Father real quick.

461
00:49:48,330 --> 00:49:51,810
Anyone have any thoughts or questions?

462
00:49:54,990 --> 00:50:03,190
He can keep just marching on. So yeah, you'll hear it talked about as tedious or testicular Genesis syndrome.

463
00:50:06,970 --> 00:50:11,530
Yeah. And so we can model this testicular, this Genesis syndrome phenomenon.

464
00:50:11,530 --> 00:50:18,129
Um, in lab animals pretty in a lot of cases with a lot of chemicals, right?

465
00:50:18,130 --> 00:50:26,170
So if you take like male laboratory animals and expose them in utero to certain chemicals like endocrine disrupting chemicals,

466
00:50:26,170 --> 00:50:34,480
you see like these symptoms that are, you know, associated with tedious, like anti energetic or estrogenic chemicals.

467
00:50:34,490 --> 00:50:39,990
And here's some examples here. So that's why we think that there might be an environmental contribution to that.

468
00:50:39,990 --> 00:50:45,420
We can basically replicate the symptoms, if you will, of tDCS like in animal models.

469
00:50:46,230 --> 00:50:53,370
And we're seeing like some of these a male reproductive endpoints are appear to be increasing in some cases.

470
00:50:53,370 --> 00:50:59,390
And you know, it's not necessarily it's not explained by like genetic variation or anything else that we can come up with.

471
00:50:59,400 --> 00:51:10,450
So the environment is a potential contributor. Phthalates are really we've talked about phthalates a few times.

472
00:51:10,450 --> 00:51:17,350
Remember, these are like these plasticizer chemicals that are in like everything or a lot of stuff.

473
00:51:18,040 --> 00:51:21,339
And exposure is very common at a fairly low levels.

474
00:51:21,340 --> 00:51:26,280
But we are told very kind of they're pretty ubiquitous in the environment.

475
00:51:26,290 --> 00:51:34,599
I have to say that exposure like in animal models to phthalates in utero produces what's called balance syndrome,

476
00:51:34,600 --> 00:51:42,040
which is basically the same as to us. Right. So you'll see in the literature of researchers will sometimes talk about family

477
00:51:42,040 --> 00:51:48,430
syndrome and so and phthalates do inhibit testosterone production in the testes so.

478
00:51:52,080 --> 00:51:56,730
And a key component of this is this idea of like sensitive windows of exposure.

479
00:51:57,180 --> 00:52:01,589
So what certain organs like the testes are going through, like the early development,

480
00:52:01,590 --> 00:52:08,940
the idea is that exposure at a particularly sensitive window by that organ is developing could lead to health outcomes later in life.

481
00:52:09,510 --> 00:52:17,460
And I thought this was a good figure to kind of illustrate that. So this is a case of rats that were exposed to a phthalate called DHP.

482
00:52:19,110 --> 00:52:24,700
And so they were exposed leading up to birth for like it looks like maybe a couple of weeks leading up to birth to the starlet.

483
00:52:26,140 --> 00:52:31,780
So the way that would happen is they're probably just putting the DHP either in the food or the water of the pregnant rat.

484
00:52:32,170 --> 00:52:40,120
And the active metabolites of DHP are being delivered into the the fetuses right after birth.

485
00:52:41,590 --> 00:52:46,360
They're not exposed to any other chemicals. And 60 days and 200 days later,

486
00:52:46,360 --> 00:52:52,569
the researchers were like measuring levels of hormones in their gonads or the adrenal glands and

487
00:52:52,570 --> 00:52:59,500
seeing disrupted levels of things like testosterone or estradiol in the case of the females.

488
00:53:00,160 --> 00:53:02,680
And so they were not currently being exposed to anything.

489
00:53:02,710 --> 00:53:07,990
This exposure occurred during a specific window of development and they were picking up effects later on.

490
00:53:08,020 --> 00:53:15,130
So I just like how this is like overlay here on the timeline to show where the exposure occurred and then where they were picking up the effects.

491
00:53:16,120 --> 00:53:21,669
So again, in euro, as the testes are developing, as the sperm Antigone are dividing,

492
00:53:21,670 --> 00:53:25,930
you're getting this spike in hormone levels that you see early on.

493
00:53:27,940 --> 00:53:32,050
You know, then the testosterone levels go down and then come back up to puberty.

494
00:53:32,590 --> 00:53:38,800
That early spike in testosterone, you know, is there for a reason in driving a lot of the development of this organ.

495
00:53:42,290 --> 00:53:48,720
So I've talked a lot about. Animal models.

496
00:53:49,020 --> 00:53:52,680
So far, a little bit about some of the human studies.

497
00:53:53,700 --> 00:53:58,169
It's really easy to predict some of these effects in animal models because we

498
00:53:58,170 --> 00:54:02,490
can control how much they're getting and control a variety of other variables.

499
00:54:03,950 --> 00:54:10,730
The human data, as you might expect, like in epidemiology studies, is a little bit more murky, I guess you might say.

500
00:54:11,210 --> 00:54:16,880
So I just wanted to pull a few examples of studies that were looking at exposures

501
00:54:16,880 --> 00:54:22,430
to phthalates and different health outcomes like hyperspace is or crypt organism.

502
00:54:23,300 --> 00:54:26,950
And you see it's not like 100% one way or the other.

503
00:54:26,960 --> 00:54:31,130
You'll see a study here or there that where there is an adult in this case,

504
00:54:31,130 --> 00:54:35,570
an occupational exposure was associated with increased risk of hyper status.

505
00:54:35,960 --> 00:54:41,620
However, there's several studies that found no association. Similarly with CryptoKitties a brain.

506
00:54:42,720 --> 00:54:48,660
Some studies are suggesting there's some kind of link between DHB exposure and CryptoKitties.

507
00:54:50,310 --> 00:54:52,890
However, some of the studies were not seeing this linkage. Right?

508
00:54:53,880 --> 00:54:59,810
So that's just a you know, I just wanted to give you that sort of, you know, there's reasons for that.

509
00:54:59,860 --> 00:55:05,400
You know, these people are not under controlled exposure scenarios or anything like that.

510
00:55:06,250 --> 00:55:13,890
There's like genetic variation that's occurring in these humans, you know, cohorts that are not present in typically in like animal models.

511
00:55:15,360 --> 00:55:20,399
So yeah, so that's just to kind of give you the full spectrum of like what the data,

512
00:55:20,400 --> 00:55:23,430
the state of the data, the state of that field looks like right now.

513
00:55:25,600 --> 00:55:30,110
Any questions? Cool.

514
00:55:32,990 --> 00:55:44,870
Okay. So as an example of an androgen antagonist, there is a metabolite of DDT that I think we've mentioned before in this class called PPD.

515
00:55:45,680 --> 00:55:50,719
It's a major metabolite of DDT. This is a potent androgen receptor antagonist.

516
00:55:50,720 --> 00:55:57,590
Does anyone remember what an antagonist is? I'll give you a clue.

517
00:55:57,590 --> 00:56:00,740
An agonist binds to a receptor and turns it on.

518
00:56:01,780 --> 00:56:05,050
Doesn't it shut it off or block it? Exactly.

519
00:56:05,500 --> 00:56:12,040
Exactly. Yeah. It binds and an antagonist will bind the receptor, not activate it, and basically block it up.

520
00:56:13,030 --> 00:56:17,260
It's basically blocking the actual hormone from interacting with that receptor.

521
00:56:18,310 --> 00:56:21,880
So this is what this chemical, this metabolite of DDT does.

522
00:56:22,780 --> 00:56:27,370
This is actually a case of wildlife toxicology or eco toxicology.

523
00:56:28,270 --> 00:56:33,700
There's a case of a lake in Florida where they saw abnormal differentiation of the

524
00:56:33,700 --> 00:56:38,440
male reproductive tract in alligators in a lake that was contaminated with DDT.

525
00:56:40,690 --> 00:56:47,350
Things like really abnormally small penises and some other things are related to like the development of the male reproductive tract.

526
00:56:49,100 --> 00:56:55,610
And then you also saw this in battles in rats exposed prenatally.

527
00:56:55,820 --> 00:57:02,510
So in utero to this to this to DDT or maybe directly to the metabolite, I'm not quite sure.

528
00:57:03,320 --> 00:57:06,590
But again, this androgen this.

529
00:57:08,250 --> 00:57:09,840
Androgen receptor antagonist.

530
00:57:09,840 --> 00:57:18,600
What's producing all of these effects like delays in puberty, reduction of testosterone levels, decreased size of various sex glands.

531
00:57:19,950 --> 00:57:25,080
Importantly, it doesn't impact the circulating levels of testosterone.

532
00:57:25,530 --> 00:57:30,510
Right. So that's kind of a point I wanted to highlight there.

533
00:57:31,520 --> 00:57:36,710
That this chemical is not affecting the levels of testosterone.

534
00:57:37,070 --> 00:57:45,049
The testosterone levels are the same. But what's happening is the chemicals interfering with the ability of the testosterone to essentially do its

535
00:57:45,050 --> 00:57:52,610
job to bind to these receptors and trigger and activate certain pathways in the male reproductive process.

536
00:57:53,210 --> 00:58:00,000
Does that make sense? So this is what makes things kind of challenging in doing risk assessments of chemical.

537
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:05,850
Sometimes really understanding what's really going on is that sometimes you can't just take

538
00:58:06,000 --> 00:58:10,860
someone's blood and look at the levels of testosterone and understand the whole picture.

539
00:58:11,220 --> 00:58:16,350
If they're exposed to a chemical that's binding to their androgen receptors and blocking them up.

540
00:58:17,420 --> 00:58:20,810
The testosterone is not necessarily going to tell you anything. They might look normal.

541
00:58:21,620 --> 00:58:27,409
So this is why we have to really think through the full biological context of

542
00:58:27,410 --> 00:58:30,590
some of these pathways to really understand what's going on in some cases.

543
00:58:31,130 --> 00:58:34,580
Because if you were to just like perform this experiment and just say,

544
00:58:34,580 --> 00:58:39,380
I'm going to measure levels of testosterone in these rats, that's going to be the only endpoint I look at.

545
00:58:39,920 --> 00:58:44,510
Well, you're going to miss a really important part of the picture. So does that make sense?

546
00:58:50,300 --> 00:58:58,040
Okay. So there's a lot of really interesting biology underlying various mechanisms of male impotence.

547
00:58:58,040 --> 00:59:04,010
We won't have time to go over all of those, but I just wanted to hit a few examples.

548
00:59:04,640 --> 00:59:11,900
So chemicals that alter the central nervous system like narcotics or ethanol or certain like psychotropic chemicals,

549
00:59:12,290 --> 00:59:17,119
can impact the central nervous system and like getting and maintaining an erection.

550
00:59:17,120 --> 00:59:20,900
Some of that signaling or a lot of that signaling actually starts in the central nervous system.

551
00:59:21,290 --> 00:59:27,050
And so chemicals that interfere with those types of processes can lead to male impotence in some cases,

552
00:59:27,410 --> 00:59:30,560
and that is a part of the overall reproductive process.

553
00:59:31,520 --> 00:59:35,660
Um, hormone modulators can also interfere with this.

554
00:59:35,870 --> 00:59:40,670
So, you know, hormone levels are important for male appearance as well.

555
00:59:41,960 --> 00:59:53,930
We've even seen in some animal models like pesticides for example can that are anti androgens can impact like impotence in animal models.

556
00:59:54,080 --> 00:59:57,890
So there's a variety of chemicals that can induce these types of effects as well.

557
00:59:59,620 --> 01:00:04,840
But yeah there's some, like, really interesting, like, signaling because it's like the way.

558
01:00:04,930 --> 01:00:11,710
Like, what's it like Viagra. Like the signaling pathways that they were interrogating to like that led to the development of Viagra.

559
01:00:12,220 --> 01:00:18,650
That's a whole thing. I don't think we'll have time to go into it, but. Okay.

560
01:00:19,490 --> 01:00:26,750
I'll just pause and hopefully not go into I feel like I'm like really marching through these slides really fast, so I hope I'm not going too fast.

561
01:00:28,250 --> 01:00:33,860
Just want to double check. Check in with everyone. So one.

562
01:00:35,670 --> 01:00:41,129
This is a I think I have a few more slides, but one kind of important thing I was going to say one final thing,

563
01:00:41,130 --> 01:00:47,400
but one important thing I want to sort of also highlight is how genetic diversity

564
01:00:47,790 --> 01:00:53,400
sort of overlays onto this as well and adds another wrinkle in the picture.

565
01:00:54,270 --> 01:00:59,280
So I was actually at a conference. I think this paper is published by now or probably some published for a number of years.

566
01:00:59,280 --> 01:01:09,030
But but I really like I asked the researcher that put this figure together actually to send me this slide because I thought it was so interesting.

567
01:01:09,780 --> 01:01:15,209
So what they did here was. They used a series of mouth strains.

568
01:01:15,210 --> 01:01:21,810
So there's this like series of. So most most mouse strains that we use in research, I think genetically identical.

569
01:01:22,650 --> 01:01:29,880
And so there's this push to develop ways to use animal models that capture true human genetic diversity.

570
01:01:30,180 --> 01:01:39,930
It's called the collaborative cross model. You may have heard of it before, but the idea is basically these are like genetically distinct,

571
01:01:39,930 --> 01:01:47,280
like strains of mice that like put together will share like the actual variation in genetic variation we see in the human population.

572
01:01:48,120 --> 01:01:53,670
And so what they did was they took like a bunch of strains from these like collaborative cross models.

573
01:01:54,060 --> 01:01:58,770
And you could see here that it's labeled like a therapy. So these are like two different strains of mice.

574
01:01:59,280 --> 01:02:05,129
And they treated the mice with an endocrine disruptors or like some kind of engineered active compound.

575
01:02:05,130 --> 01:02:12,030
I forget the exact compound. It was I think it was like some kind of estrogen, like a diet pill, still best or all type of chemical.

576
01:02:14,430 --> 01:02:20,040
And so they were looking at male reproductive effects of this, like estrogenic chemical on these mice.

577
01:02:20,040 --> 01:02:25,819
And one of the things they looked at was sperm count. And so some of the chemical, some of the mouse strains,

578
01:02:25,820 --> 01:02:31,969
if you look at like strain a the this and different disrupter or this endocrine active compound has like no effect on

579
01:02:31,970 --> 01:02:37,730
sperm count or like very little like this is like 100% compared to like probably the standard control and they use.

580
01:02:39,340 --> 01:02:47,379
However, you can see a wide variety of responses across these animal strains down to like these last few.

581
01:02:47,380 --> 01:02:52,220
It's like the sperm count is like almost obliterated entirely.

582
01:02:53,200 --> 01:02:56,260
So I thought this was a very nice sort of, uh,

583
01:02:56,680 --> 01:03:03,190
illustration of how genetic diversity might play a role because other than the genetic differences across these strains,

584
01:03:03,970 --> 01:03:07,810
I mean, ostensibly this would be the same conditions.

585
01:03:08,170 --> 01:03:10,180
Animals are fed, the same food, same, you know,

586
01:03:10,180 --> 01:03:16,300
everything's the same except for the genetic differences and exposure to this estrogen active chemical.

587
01:03:16,660 --> 01:03:18,639
And so you see this wide degree of variation.

588
01:03:18,640 --> 01:03:25,690
So that's why we have to think about in a public health context how diverse humans can be in terms of their responses to chemicals.

589
01:03:26,830 --> 01:03:33,489
I'm just curious what kind of like research this is being used in so far with these diverse strains, if any?

590
01:03:33,490 --> 01:03:42,100
And I guess personally, where you see this being most applicable and like how how big of a change is this going to give us and our perspectives?

591
01:03:42,100 --> 01:03:44,650
Because this seems like a completely different way of thinking about it.

592
01:03:45,100 --> 01:03:54,520
Yeah, you know, honestly, I am a little because the collaborative cross strains have been around for quite a while at this point, like I want to say.

593
01:03:56,180 --> 01:04:00,620
I lose track of time, but I want to say like ten years, if not more.

594
01:04:00,720 --> 01:04:09,650
Right. And I just I think I don't really kept up with like how many papers have come out like published using this particular approach.

595
01:04:09,650 --> 01:04:16,670
But yes, I, you know, I'd like to see things move in this direction. I think the problem is that it's cost, you know.

596
01:04:16,670 --> 01:04:19,639
So I think there's a couple of competing things going on here. What does it cost?

597
01:04:19,640 --> 01:04:27,830
Because like, you know, to do a study with just one strain costs X amount and then multiply that by however many strains, right?

598
01:04:28,820 --> 01:04:35,959
And then get into statistical power to pick up an fact that's you're you're really getting into like really high level studies.

599
01:04:35,960 --> 01:04:43,310
But like, you know, there's core, like, like, you know, centers and things at universities that could like approach this type of scale of work.

600
01:04:43,850 --> 01:04:49,130
Um, maybe there is only what has to be done by the government institutions too.

601
01:04:50,060 --> 01:04:54,770
So that's one thing. The other thing that I think might be sort of a competing.

602
01:04:56,030 --> 01:04:57,379
Like a counteracting force.

603
01:04:57,380 --> 01:05:05,570
And that is we're trying also to like reduce the number of animals we're using in toxicology studies for like a variety of reasons,

604
01:05:05,570 --> 01:05:14,720
you know, ethical cost, you know, like we want to move things more into in utero or not in Europe, in vitro where we can.

605
01:05:15,200 --> 01:05:17,450
So that might be pushing back against that a little bit.

606
01:05:18,950 --> 01:05:28,309
But yeah, I mean, I would love like if you gave me a multi-million dollar grant, knock on wood, I would love to incorporate this.

607
01:05:28,310 --> 01:05:31,400
Like, this is like this is so striking to me, like to see this.

608
01:05:31,910 --> 01:05:38,270
I want to go back to like find the actual paper because this is like sort of a stripped down version because they hadn't published yet.

609
01:05:38,270 --> 01:05:41,870
So they just give they gave me like just the bare bones of information.

610
01:05:42,290 --> 01:05:43,939
But I want to go back and like read the whole paper.

611
01:05:43,940 --> 01:05:50,900
Like I still have the email from like this is like the Society of Toxicology meeting in like 2018 and I haven't gone back.

612
01:05:51,470 --> 01:06:00,650
But yeah, I think it's like, why would you not? If you're doing like a public health based study, why would you not incorporate this into your study?

613
01:06:01,160 --> 01:06:04,190
Um, but I think really it's a resource limitation at this point.

614
01:06:05,700 --> 01:06:08,490
So that's a great question. Thank you for clarifying question.

615
01:06:08,520 --> 01:06:13,710
Is this the result of individual minds from the strain or the average of multiple mice per stream?

616
01:06:13,740 --> 01:06:17,220
That's a good question. I think, again, this is like an early version of this.

617
01:06:17,230 --> 01:06:18,820
I don't know what the variation looks like.

618
01:06:18,840 --> 01:06:25,320
I think for the purposes of this, we would assume that this is the average, but we don't yeah, we don't have the error bars there.

619
01:06:25,800 --> 01:06:30,690
So I don't know what the error bars look like. So that's why I just want to use that as an illustration purpose.

620
01:06:30,690 --> 01:06:36,360
Like I don't know where this went from that point, but yeah, that's a good point.

621
01:06:36,360 --> 01:06:40,439
The variation, you know, if like the error bars are like going from here to here,

622
01:06:40,440 --> 01:06:43,500
that's going to be quite a different story than if they're like really tiny error bars.

623
01:06:44,070 --> 01:06:48,240
If you can find the people who share it with us. Yeah, yeah. I'll make a note to do that.

624
01:06:59,030 --> 01:07:04,990
And yeah, she was so nice to, like, just follow up with me and share the slide with me, so.

625
01:07:05,750 --> 01:07:19,880
Oh. Okay.

626
01:07:26,030 --> 01:07:28,510
Okay. So we're actually going to make it through this.

627
01:07:28,520 --> 01:07:33,530
Well, we'll probably have a few left over, I'm thinking, but I can't believe I marched through all of those.

628
01:07:35,210 --> 01:07:45,980
Okay. So this is just a picture of the kind of the what we already talked about, but just maybe for a little bit more clarification of what happens,

629
01:07:45,980 --> 01:07:53,930
you know, you get the release of the oocyte in the case of fertilization, which obviously doesn't happen every time.

630
01:07:54,740 --> 01:08:00,860
But you get the fertilization that day, zero with this this fertilized.

631
01:08:02,850 --> 01:08:06,509
EG moving down the fallopian tube and the cell division start occurring over the

632
01:08:06,510 --> 01:08:14,570
next few days and moves into the uterine compartment and then into the implant.

633
01:08:14,640 --> 01:08:20,310
This is called the blastocyst. At this stage, this blastocyst is implanting into the uterine wall.

634
01:08:22,500 --> 01:08:29,100
And you can imagine the the sort of signaling pathways and timing of hormones that

635
01:08:29,430 --> 01:08:34,409
pathways that need to be active for this to occur in a sort of timely manner.

636
01:08:34,410 --> 01:08:40,110
Right. So this is a cartoon.

637
01:08:40,110 --> 01:08:46,649
And I want you to like, you know, a lot of these I mean, maybe I should have said this earlier, like a lot of these ads, like a ton of labels on them.

638
01:08:46,650 --> 01:08:51,960
Please don't think you up like memorize that whole slide or anything. These are just to illustrate the overall point.

639
01:08:52,320 --> 01:08:57,420
So like for this, like, please don't feel like you have to memorize every single one of these terms here or anything like that.

640
01:08:58,320 --> 01:09:02,660
So this is just a cartoon showing like the process of implantation.

641
01:09:02,670 --> 01:09:06,840
So you get this like fertilized egg and it's sort of just like essentially just like,

642
01:09:06,840 --> 01:09:13,079
um, invades into the uterine, the uterine wall and you see kind of illustrated here,

643
01:09:13,080 --> 01:09:19,350
like you're getting the formation and like remodeling of uterine blood vessels that are

644
01:09:19,350 --> 01:09:23,640
going to end up delivering the blood supply that nourish the fetus during pregnancy.

645
01:09:24,180 --> 01:09:27,840
Right. And so this is kind of an in-between point.

646
01:09:28,320 --> 01:09:34,530
And then here you got you you really have like the start of what is going to eventually be like the placenta here,

647
01:09:35,340 --> 01:09:38,100
which is directly interfacing with like maternal blood.

648
01:09:38,220 --> 01:09:45,360
And you get all these like uterine arteries are remodeled to be allowed to bring in more blood to,

649
01:09:45,390 --> 01:09:49,590
you know, essentially provide nutrients and various things for the fetus as it develops.

650
01:09:53,150 --> 01:09:55,880
Yeah. I think that's about all I wanted to get to there.

651
01:09:58,680 --> 01:10:11,340
So during pregnancy, one important thing to consider is steroid hormone production largely shifts from the ovaries to the placenta slash fetus.

652
01:10:13,060 --> 01:10:21,010
During pregnancy. And so you get here, this is a just a pathway of hormone synthesis during pregnancy.

653
01:10:21,010 --> 01:10:24,370
And you see different hormones are produced in different compartments.

654
01:10:24,970 --> 01:10:28,480
So you get uptake of cholesterol from the maternal blood.

655
01:10:29,020 --> 01:10:37,809
The cholesterol is done via various enzymatic reactions, transformed into different hormones in the fetal adrenal cortex.

656
01:10:37,810 --> 01:10:42,130
There's some other sort of hormonal reactions that take place.

657
01:10:42,760 --> 01:10:46,089
Um, yeah. That things are secreted back out.

658
01:10:46,090 --> 01:10:53,800
A few like hormone intermediates come back to the placenta and then you get like estrogens and things are pumped back out into the maternal blood.

659
01:10:54,910 --> 01:10:59,290
So there is this like circuit of like hormone synthesis that develops.

660
01:10:59,440 --> 01:11:03,250
What do you have the placenta and fetus as part of pregnancy?

661
01:11:04,840 --> 01:11:11,319
So again, this is why this to me, this is such a cool area of research because if you're thinking about like,

662
01:11:11,320 --> 01:11:18,750
say, you know, designing a drug like or, you know, just thinking about chemical exposures or whatever, you know,

663
01:11:18,760 --> 01:11:23,530
the pregnancy is like this whole other in terms of like hormone production is like

664
01:11:23,530 --> 01:11:29,080
this whole other state that individuals go through compared to the standard,

665
01:11:31,060 --> 01:11:36,969
you know, standard non-pregnant person without, you know, with, you know, where their hormones are produced in the ovaries and everything.

666
01:11:36,970 --> 01:11:43,480
So these are sort of like exceptions that we are typically thinking about are always really interesting to me, you know,

667
01:11:43,480 --> 01:11:47,410
that you feel like designing a drug you want to if it's potentially that if

668
01:11:47,410 --> 01:11:50,319
there's a potential that someone who's pregnant is going to be taking it and

669
01:11:50,320 --> 01:11:57,520
you know that it like has some type of kinetics within the body where it ends up in the placenta or something and it has effects on hormone pathways.

670
01:11:57,520 --> 01:12:01,419
Well, you got to start to think about what it's going to do to the ability of that

671
01:12:01,420 --> 01:12:06,610
person to like make certain hormones that are critical for whatever in the body.

672
01:12:06,610 --> 01:12:13,460
So. Let's see.

673
01:12:13,730 --> 01:12:17,990
Yeah. And so this is kind of going back to the diagonal still pastoral example.

674
01:12:19,160 --> 01:12:22,370
So the daughters that were exposed to diapers the best are all in utero.

675
01:12:22,760 --> 01:12:29,409
They had increased risk of miscarriage and it was thought to be linked.

676
01:12:29,410 --> 01:12:35,690
So you see comparable compared rate rates of miscarriage in the exposed versus not exposed women.

677
01:12:35,690 --> 01:12:38,870
It's like more than double in the exposed women.

678
01:12:40,490 --> 01:12:43,459
And this is thought to go along with like malformations in the uterus.

679
01:12:43,460 --> 01:12:50,280
So it's sort of sexually harder to carry a pregnancy all the way to term in the case of like a malformed uterus.

680
01:12:50,280 --> 01:12:58,700
And we talked about how like there was this like sort of constricted T-shaped to the uterus for individuals exposed to, to us.

681
01:12:59,240 --> 01:13:02,450
And so that's a very sad case.

682
01:13:06,200 --> 01:13:15,440
So in terms of the blastocyst implanting into the uterus, the universe has to be receptive for that to happen.

683
01:13:15,590 --> 01:13:19,909
There's certain signaling things that are signaling pathways that are activated that basically

684
01:13:19,910 --> 01:13:27,049
tell the uterine tissue to get ready for the blastocyst to like start to invade and,

685
01:13:27,050 --> 01:13:33,940
you know, to be receptive to implantation there. And so if you just and so a lot of that is, like I said, driven by hormones.

686
01:13:34,010 --> 01:13:43,550
So if you alter some of these hormonal pathways and the current disruptor could alter the receptivity of the uterus to this blastocyst to implant.

687
01:13:44,490 --> 01:13:52,680
Um. Yeah. So the receptivity of the uterine lining requires this, like, proper sequencing of, like,

688
01:13:52,710 --> 01:13:59,310
estrogen and progesterone stimulation to, like, be ready for the blastocyst to arrive.

689
01:13:59,430 --> 01:14:04,200
Right. And we've seen chemicals that, like, for instance,

690
01:14:04,200 --> 01:14:10,980
estrogen agonist that can disrupt this uterine differentiation that gets the uterus ready for implantation.

691
01:14:11,510 --> 01:14:19,620
Um, and then you also have placenta formation, which is this whole other, it's a whole other set of developmental processes going on.

692
01:14:22,520 --> 01:14:25,820
So the Foxy Claw. So this is an example. We see this in a rat model.

693
01:14:26,270 --> 01:14:29,180
The Foxy Claw is a pesticide. It's an estrogen agonist.

694
01:14:29,600 --> 01:14:38,740
It turns on estrogen signaling it increases the rate of this fertilized egg moving through the fallopian tube.

695
01:14:38,750 --> 01:14:42,070
So it moves at a certain pace over a few days.

696
01:14:42,080 --> 01:14:47,420
Right. But and so you don't want it to go too fast or too slow.

697
01:14:47,420 --> 01:14:50,960
Basically, it's like a pretty coordinated sequence of events.

698
01:14:51,530 --> 01:14:58,820
And so what can happen is that the embryo basically arrives when the uterus is not ready for implantation.

699
01:15:00,050 --> 01:15:04,340
So this could lead to like pregnancy loss, right? Because the embryo just doesn't implant into the uterus.

700
01:15:10,350 --> 01:15:16,830
So the things that could go wrong with pregnancy. You know, we've talked about all of these failed implantation.

701
01:15:18,270 --> 01:15:22,980
I didn't really talk about the plantation part, but that involves this remodeling of the spiral arteries,

702
01:15:23,220 --> 01:15:27,990
which are in the uterus that need to be widened to allow blood to flow through that.

703
01:15:28,440 --> 01:15:36,810
We see some indications that that certain know biotics might alter that process as well, leading to things like abnormal classification.

704
01:15:38,760 --> 01:15:45,050
Yeah. So these are basically all the things we just talked about. So.

705
01:15:46,390 --> 01:15:52,450
Someone at some point had mentioned breast milk contamination. So there's various chemicals that can wind up in the breast milk.

706
01:15:53,770 --> 01:15:57,880
Alcohol, for instance, can distribute distributes into breast milk,

707
01:15:58,720 --> 01:16:03,800
kind of forming this 1 to 1 ratio with the mother's blood chemicals that are lipophilic

708
01:16:03,850 --> 01:16:08,290
and can concentrate in breast milk because there's a high fat content in breast milk.

709
01:16:09,220 --> 01:16:10,150
Here's some examples.

710
01:16:13,420 --> 01:16:21,069
But most studies at this point are, you know, the overall suggestion still is that breast milk is so good for the developing baby,

711
01:16:21,070 --> 01:16:27,650
that despite the fact that we find some of these chemicals in breast milk, it's still better to breastfeed than to switch to formula overall.

712
01:16:27,970 --> 01:16:38,620
So. Well, we'll sort of revisit that maybe at some point, but that's the current suggested as suggested methods of breastfeeding.

713
01:16:41,400 --> 01:16:49,050
So through these last two lectures, we've talked about various parts of the lifespan and how they're susceptible to toxic insults.

714
01:16:52,790 --> 01:16:59,420
Yeah. And I think just kind of one of the last things I want to leave off is that you'll see how in many ways,

715
01:16:59,540 --> 01:17:03,200
whether we're talking about a workplace exposure or whether we're talking about exposure

716
01:17:03,350 --> 01:17:07,340
in utero or in early life when some of these developmental processes take place,

717
01:17:07,910 --> 01:17:14,420
like, well, that I sort of encourage people to do is to incorporate thinking about like what

718
01:17:14,420 --> 01:17:20,719
the social role that someone plays in terms of like what they play in society,

719
01:17:20,720 --> 01:17:24,440
in terms of their exposure to chemicals, like who is at risk. In other words,

720
01:17:25,850 --> 01:17:30,440
private individuals aren't always at the forefront of our thinking in terms of chemical impacts

721
01:17:30,440 --> 01:17:35,900
on health workers that might be working in occupations that we don't think about every day.

722
01:17:36,020 --> 01:17:41,540
You know, like certain crops, you know, people working with certain pesticides, you know, that's another thing to really consider.

723
01:17:41,540 --> 01:17:47,000
And I encourage people to sort of incorporate that way of thinking about things as they go through their career.

724
01:17:47,330 --> 01:17:53,059
And then so we can think about like occupations being sort of like at risk populations.

725
01:17:53,060 --> 01:17:59,240
We can think about pregnant individuals as being like a special case of a particularly at risk or vulnerable population,

726
01:18:00,080 --> 01:18:06,110
individual, you know, fetuses in utero, you know, that will eventually be born.

727
01:18:06,110 --> 01:18:15,470
And you look at early life, you know, all of these, you know, these sort of like things that together make up like a lot of the public.

728
01:18:15,830 --> 01:18:20,120
But individually, we don't kind of always incorporate those into the way we think about it.

729
01:18:20,450 --> 01:18:28,909
And I think really the examples that like endocrine active chemicals should like sort of

730
01:18:28,910 --> 01:18:34,660
illustrate are like a great way to sort of start to think about these types of situations and,

731
01:18:35,090 --> 01:18:40,340
and whatnot. So thanks for listening, but I can't believe I actually got through all the slides.

732
01:18:40,340 --> 01:18:46,370
So thanks. I think next time is kidneys and then we'll have a guest lecturer and we'll just keep rolling.

733
01:18:46,370 --> 01:18:51,770
So thanks again, albeit often our questions.
