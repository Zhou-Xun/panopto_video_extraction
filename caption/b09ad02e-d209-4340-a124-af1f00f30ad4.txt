00:00:09,390 --> 00:00:14,580
The Nurses Health Study is one of the United States's most amazing scientific resources.

2
00:00:15,090 --> 00:00:22,500
This study was started in 1976 by one of my former mentors, Frank Speiser, at the Harvard School of Public Health.

3
00:00:22,980 --> 00:00:29,520
And it's been prospectively following over 120,000 nurses from around the country ever since.

4
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:34,140
It's contributed to our understanding of health outcomes in countless ways.

5
00:00:34,860 --> 00:00:41,459
And yet the research is based primarily on white female nurses who are all more likely to be

6
00:00:41,460 --> 00:00:47,490
health informed and are less ethnically and socioeconomically diverse than the general population.

7
00:00:48,570 --> 00:00:53,250
So one of the questions that has arisen over the years is can we take results from

8
00:00:53,250 --> 00:00:57,630
these women and assume that it applies more generally to other groups of people?

9
00:00:58,410 --> 00:01:03,120
For example, can I take findings from the Nurses Health Study and apply them to men?

10
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:09,540
Can we assume that we'd get the same findings as what we would see for the full United States population?

11
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:13,410
What about the people of Europe or maybe Africa?

12
00:01:14,160 --> 00:01:21,660
In this particular video, I'm going to talk about this notion of whether or not findings in one study hold up

13
00:01:21,660 --> 00:01:27,360
elsewhere or whether or not these study findings are generalizable to different populations.

14
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:34,770
I'm then going to relate this concept of generalizability to another concept that's called effect modification.

15
00:01:35,460 --> 00:01:39,690
Effect modification means that results differ by person, place, or time.

16
00:01:40,530 --> 00:01:44,220
Finally, I'll talk you through what causes effect modification.

17
00:01:45,930 --> 00:01:48,780
So here is the definition of generalizability.

18
00:01:49,440 --> 00:01:58,890
Generalizability is the concept that findings from a research study in some sample population are applicable to other non sampled populations.

19
00:01:59,370 --> 00:02:07,860
For example, what those findings from the population of mostly white female nurses be applicable to the full U.S. population of men and women?

20
00:02:09,570 --> 00:02:16,830
Or are the results from a study on air pollution, exposure and respiratory health in children applicable to adults?

21
00:02:17,820 --> 00:02:22,770
Now often people make the assessment of if something is generalizable by simply

22
00:02:22,770 --> 00:02:27,510
considering how different the study population is from their population of interest.

23
00:02:28,260 --> 00:02:32,880
Now, clearly, there's huge differences in age between children and adults by definition.

24
00:02:33,450 --> 00:02:35,520
And thinking back to the Nurses Health study.

25
00:02:35,820 --> 00:02:42,720
There's no doubt that the study participants don't look like the full U.S. population with respect to many different characteristics.

26
00:02:43,530 --> 00:02:51,900
But here's the thing it's actually not enough just to have differences in characteristics between the two populations of interest.

27
00:02:52,260 --> 00:02:57,780
In order for us to determine that the results from one population don't apply to the other.

28
00:02:59,490 --> 00:03:06,630
The reason why is that when you say that the results from one sample population are not applying elsewhere,

29
00:03:06,990 --> 00:03:11,639
what you're actually implying is that there's some fundamental difference in

30
00:03:11,640 --> 00:03:17,490
how these two populations would experience the impacts of exposure on health.

31
00:03:19,320 --> 00:03:25,740
This brings us to the notion of effect modification, because if you're saying something is not generalizable,

32
00:03:26,100 --> 00:03:33,240
you're saying that effect modification is present and the modifier is different between two populations.

33
00:03:34,260 --> 00:03:42,479
So what is effect modification? Well, effect modification defines a scenario when the strength or direction of an association

34
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:47,700
between an exposure and an outcome differs because of some other third variable.

35
00:03:48,540 --> 00:03:56,790
Well, this sounds very similar to confounding. It differs importantly in that it's not a form of bias to be removed or accounted for,

36
00:03:57,210 --> 00:04:02,280
but rather it's a real phenomenon that is of interest and the utmost importance.

37
00:04:04,100 --> 00:04:10,070
Now differences that we see because of effect modification, again, are not because of bias.

38
00:04:11,090 --> 00:04:14,030
So let's think about why we see differences.

39
00:04:14,390 --> 00:04:21,800
Again, revisiting my example of air pollution, respiratory health in kids will try and understand this concept.

40
00:04:22,940 --> 00:04:30,410
Now, there's actually several reasons that kids might have a stronger response between air pollution exposures and lung health than grown ups.

41
00:04:31,210 --> 00:04:36,350
First, kids actually have higher inhalation rates per body size than adults,

42
00:04:36,740 --> 00:04:42,110
meaning that the internal burden of pollution can be much higher for children than it is for adults.

43
00:04:42,590 --> 00:04:46,130
In addition, children's lungs are still developing,

44
00:04:46,610 --> 00:04:53,150
so that means that they are physiologically likely to be more sensitive to insults than healthy adults.

45
00:04:54,260 --> 00:05:02,300
Finally, kids are also spending much more time outside than grown ups and therefore experience higher levels of air pollution.

46
00:05:03,290 --> 00:05:10,759
Collectively, these biological and physical reasons are what make it such that every unit of

47
00:05:10,760 --> 00:05:16,610
particle matter and ambient air may be more toxic to children than in healthy adults.

48
00:05:17,450 --> 00:05:18,499
For this reason,

49
00:05:18,500 --> 00:05:28,700
it is not unreasonable to conclude that the findings of a study in children on air pollution may not be generalizable to healthy adults.

50
00:05:30,590 --> 00:05:36,139
Now, hopefully this discussion gave you some insight as to the thought processes required in order to

51
00:05:36,140 --> 00:05:42,200
determine that results from one study population are generalizable or not generalizable to another.

52
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:49,760
The key takeaway from this video is that when you want to decide if a study's findings are generalizable to a different group,

53
00:05:50,180 --> 00:05:56,180
you really must ask yourself not just if there are characteristics that differ between the populations,

54
00:05:56,600 --> 00:06:04,190
but also whether or not those characteristics that differ between the populations also modify the associations of interest.
