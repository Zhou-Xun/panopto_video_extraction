00:00:01,770 --> 00:00:06,220
Theoretical Considerations
in Achieving Health Equity.

2
00:00:06,220 --> 00:00:11,280
Throughout life, there are opportunities
to achieve good health and avoid illness.

3
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:16,440
There are also obstacles that begin
before poor health is recognized.

4
00:00:16,440 --> 00:00:21,070
To address how social determinants
of health influence health,

5
00:00:21,070 --> 00:00:25,510
you must determine which conceptual
framework or model may be useful for

6
00:00:25,510 --> 00:00:29,420
your population and health outcomes.

7
00:00:29,420 --> 00:00:33,670
In this session, you will be introduced to
three conceptual frameworks available to

8
00:00:33,670 --> 00:00:36,388
better understand these connections.

9
00:00:36,388 --> 00:00:42,350
Davis and Chapa's framework translate
knowledge into action for change.

10
00:00:42,350 --> 00:00:46,950
The process begins with the understanding
of the links between social conditions,

11
00:00:46,950 --> 00:00:51,370
environmental factors and policy
issues related to health disparities,

12
00:00:51,370 --> 00:00:54,630
health equity and social justice.

13
00:00:54,630 --> 00:00:59,370
The challenge is determining the necessary
policy changes required to influence

14
00:00:59,370 --> 00:01:04,130
an equal distribution of
resources across groups.

15
00:01:04,130 --> 00:01:08,230
This process is always difficult and slow.

16
00:01:08,230 --> 00:01:10,970
The equitable distribution of money,
power, and

17
00:01:10,970 --> 00:01:16,360
resources require changes by decision
makers as reflected in social policies,

18
00:01:16,360 --> 00:01:20,550
as well as societal and cultural values.

19
00:01:20,550 --> 00:01:24,524
Again, multiple levels of
influence should be examined,

20
00:01:24,524 --> 00:01:30,262
especially social economic status and
political issues.

21
00:01:30,262 --> 00:01:34,925
Influencing structural determinants of
health, such as income, education, or

22
00:01:34,925 --> 00:01:36,457
occupation is difficult,

23
00:01:36,457 --> 00:01:42,080
which tends to reinforce health
inequities when left unchanged.

24
00:01:42,080 --> 00:01:46,296
Policies and practices that
sustain structures for power and

25
00:01:46,296 --> 00:01:51,567
access to resources include
discrimination, employment opportunities,

26
00:01:51,567 --> 00:01:57,050
income disparities, housing practices and
educational access.

27
00:01:57,050 --> 00:02:02,212
This upstream approach
requires a focus on policies.

28
00:02:02,212 --> 00:02:06,812
Giving voice to the disenfranchised
is a critical aspect of this work

29
00:02:06,812 --> 00:02:14,340
because policymakers must be informed
about what may make a difference.

30
00:02:14,340 --> 00:02:18,770
It is also possible to influence health
through intermediary, individual and

31
00:02:18,770 --> 00:02:23,670
interpersonal determinants of health
through biological, psychological and

32
00:02:23,670 --> 00:02:26,965
social factors.

33
00:02:26,965 --> 00:02:32,360
Interventions delivered to individuals and
communities can be effective.

34
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:36,390
However, this downstream
approach affects fewer people and

35
00:02:36,390 --> 00:02:40,970
you must move beyond lifestyle choices and
individual behaviors to

36
00:02:40,970 --> 00:02:46,500
include a focus on social determinants
of health to ensure success.

37
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:51,450
Finally, the role of health
delivery systems can directly

38
00:02:51,450 --> 00:02:57,520
influence health, but a social
determinance of health lens must be used.

39
00:02:57,520 --> 00:03:02,142
This model suggests that structural
determinance of health is mediated

40
00:03:02,142 --> 00:03:06,672
through intermediary determinants.

41
00:03:06,672 --> 00:03:09,808
Health disparities linked to economic,
social, and

42
00:03:09,808 --> 00:03:13,620
environmental disadvantage
will be difficult to change.

43
00:03:13,620 --> 00:03:19,090
However, a social determinance of health
focus is useful to increase chances for

44
00:03:19,090 --> 00:03:20,940
success.

45
00:03:20,940 --> 00:03:24,620
Gilbert Gee and colleagues offer
a framework to examine a life course

46
00:03:24,620 --> 00:03:30,610
perspective on health which emphasizes the
significance of change over the lifetime.

47
00:03:30,610 --> 00:03:34,850
They argue that individuals move in and
out of social systems as they age,

48
00:03:34,850 --> 00:03:40,030
with potential for additional exposure
to racial discrimination over time.

49
00:03:40,030 --> 00:03:46,454
These systems are viewed as fundamental
causes of inequalities in health.

50
00:03:46,454 --> 00:03:48,703
Few studies examine how race and

51
00:03:48,703 --> 00:03:55,820
racism interact throughout the life
course to affect illness and mortality.

52
00:03:55,820 --> 00:04:00,300
This conceptual model addresses
racism's link to disparities in life

53
00:04:00,300 --> 00:04:05,220
expectancies based on two
trajectories with different outcomes.

54
00:04:05,220 --> 00:04:10,022
The differences are due to the amount
of time spent in each life phase

55
00:04:10,022 --> 00:04:16,221
from the prenatal period to retirement.

56
00:04:16,221 --> 00:04:19,776
It highlights early childhood,
education, work, and

57
00:04:19,776 --> 00:04:26,210
retirement experiences as critical
social contexts for understanding aging.

58
00:04:26,210 --> 00:04:30,420
It suggests that disparities happen
over the life course due to the amount

59
00:04:30,420 --> 00:04:34,700
of time spent at each life
stage that allows for

60
00:04:34,700 --> 00:04:43,060
accumulating resources or experiencing
barriers to opportunities for success.

61
00:04:43,060 --> 00:04:47,070
This framework also considers the nature
of changes in race relations,

62
00:04:47,070 --> 00:04:53,060
as well as how disparities can be
transferred across generations.

63
00:04:53,060 --> 00:04:54,430
Based on this framework,

64
00:04:54,430 --> 00:04:59,720
we must consider how racism creates
immediate adverse exposures.

65
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:06,700
But also how it structures the amount
of time exposed to adverse events.

66
00:05:06,700 --> 00:05:09,590
One of the most well known models
of the influence of racism

67
00:05:09,590 --> 00:05:13,250
on health is
Carama Jones' A Gardener's Tale,

68
00:05:13,250 --> 00:05:19,480
that links health disparities to three
levels of socioecological racism.

69
00:05:19,480 --> 00:05:26,970
Institutional racism, personally
mediated racism and internalized racism.

70
00:05:26,970 --> 00:05:29,710
Institutionalized racism
is characterized by

71
00:05:29,710 --> 00:05:34,600
differential access to societal
resources that have become normal.

72
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:42,596
What resources would you add to this list?

73
00:05:42,596 --> 00:05:46,759
Personally mediated racism refers
to issues of prejudice and

74
00:05:46,759 --> 00:05:51,650
discrimination both intentionally and
unintentionally.

75
00:05:51,650 --> 00:05:59,780
What other experiences would you add to
this list for vulnerable populations?

76
00:05:59,780 --> 00:06:04,779
Internalized racism is acceptance by
stigmatized identities of negative

77
00:06:04,779 --> 00:06:07,570
messages about themselves.

78
00:06:07,570 --> 00:06:15,532
What examples would you add?

79
00:06:15,532 --> 00:06:20,157
Here are several examples of structural
policies and pathways that have

80
00:06:20,157 --> 00:06:25,185
resulted in inequitable distribution
of resources throughout US history.

81
00:06:25,185 --> 00:06:31,040
Color-blind laws and policies include
the Social Security Act of 1935,

82
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:35,120
that excluded domestic workers.

83
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:40,310
The War on Drugs and Tough on
Crime Policies of the 1970s and 80s,

84
00:06:40,310 --> 00:06:44,400
which resulted in the over-representation
of people of color in prison,

85
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:48,180
especially African American men and
Latino men.

86
00:06:48,180 --> 00:06:52,450
Housing policies such as red lining,
that restricted neighborhoods

87
00:06:52,450 --> 00:06:56,490
African Americans can live in,
even after serving in the military.

88
00:06:56,490 --> 00:07:00,830
Current residential and loan policies
that restrict access to safe housing for

89
00:07:00,830 --> 00:07:03,570
minority populations today.

90
00:07:03,570 --> 00:07:06,790
And discriminatory employment
practices that limit

91
00:07:06,790 --> 00:07:11,230
access to capital
resources over generations.

92
00:07:11,230 --> 00:07:16,380
Pathways between racism and
health include economic injustice,

93
00:07:16,380 --> 00:07:19,910
environmental and occupational inequities.

94
00:07:19,910 --> 00:07:25,188
Targeted marketing of health harmful
substances, political exclusion,

95
00:07:25,188 --> 00:07:29,064
psychological traumas from
micro-aggressions, and

96
00:07:29,064 --> 00:07:33,688
maladaptive coping behaviors.

97
00:07:33,688 --> 00:07:38,152
As you think about your final paper,
consider how any of these factors may

98
00:07:38,152 --> 00:07:41,680
influence the health of your
population of interest, and

99
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:45,632
what might be done to reduce, or
eliminate resulting disparities.
