1
00:00:00,570 --> 00:00:04,740
Land grabs from the ground ourselves before class.

2
00:00:06,780 --> 00:00:19,509
Hardly creamy stuff is on our heat. Tastes good. So if you're if you're sitting at a desk, take a couple of deep breaths, shake it off, relax.

3
00:00:19,510 --> 00:00:22,290
For the next 80 minutes, you have nothing to do but be here.

4
00:00:23,130 --> 00:00:30,959
Just let's be totally present for 80 years and block out all the stress is actually avoid it.

5
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:35,940
Coping behavior in a short amount is an adaptive coping strategy.

6
00:00:36,630 --> 00:00:39,390
So if you're in the next 80 minutes,

7
00:00:39,720 --> 00:00:48,000
you want to put everything else out of your head that's actually very mentally healthy because you're not going to solve any problems in 80 minutes.

8
00:00:48,390 --> 00:00:54,690
You're not going to order any library, not ordering anything online that you need.

9
00:00:56,340 --> 00:01:04,140
So yeah. So hopefully you will be able to just be present there in minutes.

10
00:01:05,670 --> 00:01:13,530
Any announcements non am.

11
00:01:13,530 --> 00:01:18,089
I'm going to call you out. I saw your picture on the thing.

12
00:01:18,090 --> 00:01:25,080
You do the vector. Well, I think I don't know what comes out to you, but I know they do like the spotlights on different students,

13
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:40,889
so it's kind of cool and like kind of works in the violence. So if you haven't read it, it's an, in a word, exhilarating, captivating little synopsis.

14
00:01:40,890 --> 00:01:45,570
So anyone else been famous lately? Are you famous?

15
00:01:45,570 --> 00:01:53,670
Are you trying to think I it it's like on Instagram now obviously it doesn't really matter don't

16
00:01:53,670 --> 00:02:02,670
have anyone else famous like for 2 minutes 30 seconds I will take something from like 2020.

17
00:02:02,730 --> 00:02:09,740
Really? Yeah. It's just me crying. Oh, now what's the definition of viral like?

18
00:02:09,750 --> 00:02:17,730
Is there like so many followers equals viral and it is viral or something or pretty viral?

19
00:02:18,040 --> 00:02:28,920
Everybody is using with viral is either they got the virus or you know, that's like anyone else pretty viral around in terms of TikTok or that.

20
00:02:29,670 --> 00:02:34,800
All right. So we have an assignment due today, so thank you all for showing up.

21
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:39,960
Those of you that are here and present. And again, if you're not finished with your assignment, that's okay.

22
00:02:40,380 --> 00:02:43,490
You're not going to work on it in here. I just talked with Kaela.

23
00:02:44,250 --> 00:02:50,280
She's not going to start grading until Sunday morning, so we need more time to take until Sunday morning.

24
00:02:54,690 --> 00:02:57,930
And that only applies to people that are currently in the room.

25
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:03,520
Oh, that's okay.

26
00:03:03,570 --> 00:03:08,520
I mean, if you are not currently in the room and I will take pictures of those interruptions,

27
00:03:10,530 --> 00:03:18,930
you think I'm helping them out because you all took the time to come here?

28
00:03:18,970 --> 00:03:28,380
I think that's important to take away. Like we don't want a host to be taking your picture, not only to get my bad side on the topic.

29
00:03:29,690 --> 00:03:35,370
Well, this seems to be the most like needy group in terms of appearance.

30
00:03:35,550 --> 00:03:48,060
I mean, just with all the comments about how you look in the light. So I'm going to take you last at because I mean, why do you need over here, John?

31
00:03:48,060 --> 00:03:57,800
Are you okay with that? You look a little scary that it might not work.

32
00:04:00,900 --> 00:04:17,800
And I know, but you're just like, whatever is inside you want to do is have I am not have been without a lot of people.

33
00:04:18,960 --> 00:04:42,030
So another aspect of who I call Stephanie, if you're not here, if you're not here and you have a valid excuse, then you can email like and myself.

34
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:45,530
So, you know, if someone's like home with COVID, I don't want to encourage them.

35
00:04:46,140 --> 00:04:50,830
But I do think that it's important to reinforce people who have made it in class.

36
00:04:50,910 --> 00:04:54,560
Yeah. Oh no. I was just telling you have those.

37
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:58,470
Oh you sliced your hand up a one day I.

38
00:05:00,440 --> 00:05:09,200
This man mutilated his hands still in class because he has a strong desire to learn and change the world.

39
00:05:09,290 --> 00:05:22,530
You have to sit. And after all, if you are here, then I suspect that there are others who can do just that.

40
00:05:23,300 --> 00:05:29,960
I came here and I want you to know what you know.

41
00:05:30,860 --> 00:05:34,820
How do you know what scares me? Yeah, maybe a little.

42
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:41,750
There are so many other fun and games here.

43
00:05:41,750 --> 00:05:46,100
Well, before we get started. Anyone else have anything funny?

44
00:05:46,230 --> 00:05:50,930
They want to talk about things like government into science. All right, so.

45
00:05:51,290 --> 00:06:01,220
Oh, I do have one thing. It's November six, and then you all know that it's the end of the semester is like usually around the corner.

46
00:06:01,910 --> 00:06:15,389
We have just a little over a month left. So if you didn't know that now, you know, so it kind of hit me the other day.

47
00:06:15,390 --> 00:06:20,810
I was like, Oh [INAUDIBLE], November is 11, then comes 12, and then it's bye bye.

48
00:06:21,230 --> 00:06:25,300
So anyway. All right.

49
00:06:25,310 --> 00:06:30,260
Oh, I know. The other thing was, I knew if I talked long enough, it would come out the grooves.

50
00:06:30,470 --> 00:06:37,310
There's still a lot of people, a lot of people who have not signed up for grooves on the spreadsheet.

51
00:06:37,760 --> 00:06:43,100
So the way the jam board works, I didn't really explain a whole lot.

52
00:06:43,550 --> 00:06:49,790
You can put your name on different populations and issues and things, and it's really just a way to then find other people.

53
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:54,229
So like, let's say you're interested in a particular health issue and you see a couple of names there,

54
00:06:54,230 --> 00:06:58,070
you can contact them and say, Hey, you want to form a group or things like that.

55
00:06:58,070 --> 00:07:04,040
Now some of you already know each other, and so you've already formed groups or you've talked through some of the classes.

56
00:07:04,490 --> 00:07:12,350
But yeah, so the jam board is there. Just to find an initial way to connect your topic.

57
00:07:12,740 --> 00:07:15,740
You write down in the spreadsheet can be about anything.

58
00:07:16,130 --> 00:07:23,330
So even if you connected over diabetes, when you all talk to each other, you decided you wanted to do hypertension.

59
00:07:23,630 --> 00:07:32,990
Totally fine. So you can it doesn't you're not locked into that even once you write down an idea on the spreadsheet.

60
00:07:34,430 --> 00:07:39,440
Francis told her she prayed in Google and even wants to write something down.

61
00:07:39,740 --> 00:07:44,710
You can change that too. So you may meet with your group and you start looking at the literature and you're like, Yeah,

62
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:52,820
there's really nothing on hypertension for Native Americans, so I think I'm going to go with X or Y.

63
00:07:53,030 --> 00:07:59,000
Totally cool. All right. It's really just a way to bring you together, start talking about something.

64
00:07:59,330 --> 00:08:06,710
But then as you're talking with each other, then that's that process can go anywhere you want to go.

65
00:08:06,910 --> 00:08:10,520
Right. Does that make sense? Anyone have any questions about the group formations?

66
00:08:11,780 --> 00:08:15,560
All right. And Akeelah has a unique group for the CRC.

67
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:19,040
Did you make it even smaller this time? Yeah, I did it across that.

68
00:08:19,070 --> 00:08:23,780
Yeah. So that was the extent of what's going on, you know, at this point.

69
00:08:23,930 --> 00:08:28,070
So we can be hopefully. All right. So I want to start off with a quote.

70
00:08:28,610 --> 00:08:31,340
How many people know who Wilma mankiller is? Does anyone know?

71
00:08:31,370 --> 00:08:44,180
Genes and education at this university is wonderful and amazing numbers of faculty so well.

72
00:08:44,420 --> 00:08:50,030
Mankiller is the first female principal chief of the Cherokee Nation,

73
00:08:50,690 --> 00:08:58,490
also the first woman ever to be elected in a major role within native tribes within the U.S.

74
00:08:59,810 --> 00:09:06,050
She passed away, I think, 2010. Very, very powerful, thoughtful person.

75
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:14,240
And she really did break all kinds of barriers by having such a high leadership position within native communities.

76
00:09:14,750 --> 00:09:22,880
So this quote from her growth is a painful process. If we're ever going to collectively begin to grapple with the problems that we have collectively.

77
00:09:23,300 --> 00:09:29,060
We're going to have to move back the veil and deal with each other on a more human level.

78
00:09:29,690 --> 00:09:36,360
The reason why I chose that. As we start about talking about community, is that, you know,

79
00:09:36,380 --> 00:09:44,090
when we're looking and thinking and talking about the role of community in public health and particularly in public health interventions,

80
00:09:44,900 --> 00:09:56,300
we have to think collectively and we also have to be really honest and open and connect with people on that human level.

81
00:09:56,690 --> 00:10:02,690
You know, we talk about at different times, I think in public health sometimes, especially in certain fields like epidemiology,

82
00:10:02,690 --> 00:10:10,040
maybe it can be at times removed from the human experience when we turn anything into numbers.

83
00:10:10,430 --> 00:10:15,530
And so, you know, I think that when we're talking about working with communities,

84
00:10:15,950 --> 00:10:23,029
we aren't talking about groups of people, but those groups of people are made up of humans and human experiences.

85
00:10:23,030 --> 00:10:30,079
And just because, let's say I'm part of a particular geographic community and Akeelah is part of

86
00:10:30,080 --> 00:10:34,100
that same geographic community doesn't mean we have the same human experience.

87
00:10:34,580 --> 00:10:41,750
So we have to be really, really careful when we talk about community and when we use that term community,

88
00:10:42,110 --> 00:10:46,010
you know, we serve in other classes and other spaces.

89
00:10:46,250 --> 00:10:54,140
You know, you hear things like, well, this is what the black community thinks are the gay community centers or the disability community things.

90
00:10:56,300 --> 00:11:06,440
Who knows? You know, I mean, that could be that is a common belief among individuals that are part of that affinity group or geographic group.

91
00:11:06,920 --> 00:11:12,350
But we have to be really careful not to erase the individual level of human experience.

92
00:11:12,980 --> 00:11:16,100
So makes sense. Cool, cool, cool.

93
00:11:17,810 --> 00:11:23,600
All right. Well, in committee in Public Health, we've already talked about this in different ways.

94
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:27,680
This is kind of like a deep dive into community.

95
00:11:27,980 --> 00:11:36,440
When you hear the word community, what pops in your head? Let's not be all intellectuals and let's just like what scares people.

96
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:38,450
People. Tell me more about that.

97
00:11:39,590 --> 00:11:47,960
My guess is, just like you can find people like me, like people like in like the different communities, people can be part of it.

98
00:11:48,230 --> 00:11:49,760
Okay. And when you think of it,

99
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:58,270
do you think of it more geographically because you send people around are you around them because of the geography or identity or identity?

100
00:11:58,600 --> 00:12:04,749
Identity. Okay, cool. What else? You could just go.

101
00:12:04,750 --> 00:12:07,990
Oh, sure. All right. Support groups. Okay.

102
00:12:08,010 --> 00:12:13,350
Tell me more about that. I agree with the identity oriented versus geographic orientation when I think about it.

103
00:12:13,350 --> 00:12:17,850
But just like a group of people who are fairly like minded and support each other.

104
00:12:18,130 --> 00:12:27,810
Okay. Yeah. I think proximity could be geographic, but it also could be like you're in the same location.

105
00:12:27,810 --> 00:12:31,190
Like we're all in the same class because we all share interests.

106
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:37,559
Right. Yeah. So shared interests. And I think that's another one because sometimes you may have you may not have shared identities,

107
00:12:37,560 --> 00:12:41,370
but you have shared interests and that could bring people together to the top.

108
00:12:41,610 --> 00:12:50,730
You know, you're say definitely sharing something, whether that be like a place of experiences or ideas, beliefs, interests like that.

109
00:12:51,530 --> 00:12:55,020
Something that you can like have in common with someone else. Right. Yeah.

110
00:12:55,050 --> 00:13:01,710
Like that sharing. That's something you share, whether it be like books that said, you might share an identity, you might share an interest,

111
00:13:02,250 --> 00:13:06,840
you might share believe, you may share a neighborhood, you might share a house, but it's some kind of connection.

112
00:13:07,230 --> 00:13:10,250
What else? What else comes to your mind? Reading. Yeah. Yeah.

113
00:13:11,010 --> 00:13:15,880
People can make you work, like. Okay.

114
00:13:16,830 --> 00:13:18,480
Yeah. So people are working toward a common goal,

115
00:13:18,690 --> 00:13:25,230
and those people could have very disparate or different viewpoints, perspectives, locations, all that stuff.

116
00:13:25,470 --> 00:13:28,730
But they have a common purpose becoming all Americans. Good.

117
00:13:28,980 --> 00:13:32,900
What else? I don't even have northern sides of any bridge.

118
00:13:33,030 --> 00:13:36,389
I think the first thing that pops into my head is, like, geographic.

119
00:13:36,390 --> 00:13:43,950
So, like community centers or like community schools. It's like, oh, like services for the use of people living in the same area.

120
00:13:43,980 --> 00:13:48,110
Right. Yeah. I think that's how it is often used.

121
00:13:48,110 --> 00:13:51,870
You know, when you talk about like what you know, like I said, a community school,

122
00:13:51,870 --> 00:13:56,700
community garden, you know, and a lot of times it is just more geographically based.

123
00:13:57,390 --> 00:14:05,940
But then also sometimes your geographic placing is also related to your identity groups, are your lived experiences, things like that.

124
00:14:06,750 --> 00:14:11,870
What else? Yeah. I think that people can have multiple different.

125
00:14:13,060 --> 00:14:16,760
Yeah. I mean different than the religious, you know.

126
00:14:16,970 --> 00:14:29,750
And I think that you're like, you're like 16, I guess she's like, you know, show a sense of diversity whether you are in a diverse or not.

127
00:14:30,200 --> 00:14:34,550
When I think of it, I think of like my city. Like, just like a bunch of like.

128
00:14:35,470 --> 00:14:39,370
People in their twenties and thirties gathering together to help out.

129
00:14:42,010 --> 00:14:44,020
Yeah. That's an interesting way, too.

130
00:14:44,020 --> 00:14:49,659
As you were talking, I was thinking, although I haven't really heard this term be used a lot, but intersectional communities,

131
00:14:49,660 --> 00:14:53,559
just like we have intersectional identities, we also have intersectional communities, like you said.

132
00:14:53,560 --> 00:15:00,100
I mean, we may have a faith based space. It's really important that you may have an identity space and just a place where we grew up.

133
00:15:00,550 --> 00:15:05,590
Yeah. So that is important because again, when there's so much talk and public health about us,

134
00:15:06,010 --> 00:15:10,510
you know, people are saying you've got to involve the community. I say that all the time. Right. But what does that mean?

135
00:15:10,840 --> 00:15:14,380
You know, when we're saying about the community, who is that community coming out of the gym?

136
00:15:14,740 --> 00:15:19,719
Yeah, it's kind of actually going off this man's point. And I was in the class last week.

137
00:15:19,720 --> 00:15:27,430
We talked about the differences between neighbors like your neighborhood can be a community, but your community doesn't have to be a neighborhood.

138
00:15:27,790 --> 00:15:30,909
And going out of that conversation, you had something I was thinking about.

139
00:15:30,910 --> 00:15:35,350
It's like how sometimes people will put you in a community like communities.

140
00:15:35,560 --> 00:15:40,480
You kind of have that ability to like self-select. So maybe it is on interest, but like identities,

141
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:47,440
people that you like don't have a specific like involvement with necessarily people who will try to put you in that community.

142
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:51,520
You're like as a spokesperson just because you share that same identity.

143
00:15:52,420 --> 00:15:55,330
Yeah, that's a really good point because, you know, when we talk about identities,

144
00:15:55,340 --> 00:16:01,480
we talked about sometimes there's identities that you select and sometimes there's identities that someone else selects for you.

145
00:16:01,870 --> 00:16:05,080
And I think that's an excellent point that the same thing can be with communities.

146
00:16:05,500 --> 00:16:11,979
Like someone may put you in a particular identity community because they're

147
00:16:11,980 --> 00:16:15,190
making an assumption about your identity or an assumption about your interests.

148
00:16:15,610 --> 00:16:21,340
You know, if it's a group of younger people, oh, well, you you think you know this, this and that,

149
00:16:21,760 --> 00:16:30,700
but your biologic age does not necessarily equate to your level of maturity or your interests or things like that.

150
00:16:31,270 --> 00:16:35,770
Excellent point is what else? What else do you think about? I just.

151
00:16:35,800 --> 00:16:41,790
I what I just reminded me think I hear of, like how like the university was like write about your community together.

152
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:47,710
Mhm. I kind of remind me like when I was doing that essay which was like a long time ago.

153
00:16:47,740 --> 00:16:53,000
Mhm. You're so old. I know. I feel old. I have knee pain on my face.

154
00:16:55,480 --> 00:17:01,030
It kind of reminded me like sitting down and like kind of like a different community.

155
00:17:01,030 --> 00:17:06,639
I was like at the time it was very much like the first thing that came to mind,

156
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:13,300
really geographic and then like social identity based, like race, religion, like all that stuff.

157
00:17:14,980 --> 00:17:21,160
So those are just kind of like first things up to my mind then. And still I think about like when people think of the word, that's like a person.

158
00:17:21,500 --> 00:17:27,610
Yeah, yeah. Thanks for sharing. I think, you know, it's really important again, when we're doing work in public health,

159
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:32,590
it's so much of a focus hopefully in different parts of public, um,

160
00:17:33,190 --> 00:17:37,940
focused on like involving community engagement, community based, participatory research,

161
00:17:37,940 --> 00:17:42,849
you know, all these different phenomena that you have to be really careful about.

162
00:17:42,850 --> 00:17:48,010
What's your automatic thought? And that's what I want to do is kind of like, tell me what pops into your head.

163
00:17:48,430 --> 00:17:57,370
Because just like assumptions we make based on identity or other kind of forms of expression,

164
00:17:58,600 --> 00:18:01,389
if we don't kind of interrogate that and be critical about it,

165
00:18:01,390 --> 00:18:09,280
we may be going down a particular road and, you know, working think if we think it's all about the geographic community.

166
00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:15,490
And I think that's a great point to make about how some neighborhoods are in communities, but then some neighborhoods are just a place to live.

167
00:18:16,990 --> 00:18:20,170
And so if you're coming in with a program and you're like,

168
00:18:20,410 --> 00:18:31,360
this is a community centered program and you're defining community as a geographic space, but people within that space don't really get along.

169
00:18:31,720 --> 00:18:34,720
You can have a more disastrous program.

170
00:18:35,230 --> 00:18:42,190
Um, I can tell you one clear example of something that happened in some places in Chicago.

171
00:18:42,190 --> 00:18:45,940
So when I was working on the, in the south east side of Chicago, there's two communities,

172
00:18:45,940 --> 00:18:49,930
a little village and Pilsen that are predominately Mexican-American communities,

173
00:18:50,770 --> 00:18:56,470
and there's different gangs that kind of inhabit different parts of those spaces.

174
00:18:56,830 --> 00:19:04,420
And so some people in public health were coming in and doing it by the geographic community without paying any attention to the gang lines.

175
00:19:05,380 --> 00:19:11,020
And so they were trying to like bring people together and they had fights and they had,

176
00:19:11,020 --> 00:19:14,660
you know, our people would show up because it's a safety issue, right?

177
00:19:14,710 --> 00:19:18,970
It's like, I'm not going there. That's the two six territory. I'm not going to this area.

178
00:19:18,970 --> 00:19:20,020
I'm not going to that area.

179
00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:27,730
So it's important for us to really understand how people are defining communities and what are those aspects of the communities.

180
00:19:28,840 --> 00:19:35,500
And even when you look at funding that's available a lot of times through like city and county Department of Public Health,

181
00:19:35,740 --> 00:19:39,100
it's based on geographic like geocoding.

182
00:19:39,100 --> 00:19:48,070
So like what is the geographic area? So it's like you have to serve the Detroit metropolitan area or you have to serve,

183
00:19:48,340 --> 00:19:51,850
you know, southeast Michigan, and that includes these eight counties.

184
00:19:52,270 --> 00:19:56,290
So a lot of funding is purely geographically based.

185
00:19:56,950 --> 00:20:05,110
But if you're going in that geographic mind and you're not paying attention to what's happening in those geographic spaces,

186
00:20:05,500 --> 00:20:10,329
we can have a lot of the I after genic effects that I talked about before where you could create

187
00:20:10,330 --> 00:20:14,920
programs where people could like literally get killed if you're trying to bring together,

188
00:20:15,070 --> 00:20:19,980
you know, potentially rival neighborhoods or rival groups, same could be with religion.

189
00:20:19,990 --> 00:20:25,930
So you could have different faith communities in these areas that they may share a zip code,

190
00:20:26,440 --> 00:20:31,470
but their connection with each other is like the farthest thing,

191
00:20:31,830 --> 00:20:37,060
you know, they may relate to someone in 12 zip codes over more than someone in their own zip code.

192
00:20:37,390 --> 00:20:42,730
So those are important factors to think about. Any other initial thoughts on community before we get into the.

193
00:20:44,780 --> 00:20:49,370
In the back. Ever angry with what everyone said.

194
00:20:49,700 --> 00:20:58,920
But another thing that I kind of thought about was how communities can be created through like shared experiences or shared hardship.

195
00:20:58,940 --> 00:21:00,690
So something that I thought about,

196
00:21:00,690 --> 00:21:09,330
like when I think about communities is like diaspora or immigrant communities where like you're kind of forced to come together in a sense.

197
00:21:09,350 --> 00:21:14,030
But it also does create strong communities a lot of time that was just something that.

198
00:21:14,450 --> 00:21:22,370
Yeah, and that, you know, the people talked to about different communities that are created out of shared oppression.

199
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:23,380
Right.

200
00:21:23,390 --> 00:21:30,920
So even though like with immigrant communities, you may even have different sectors that in their country of origin may not get along that well.

201
00:21:31,220 --> 00:21:35,060
But then when put into another space where they're surrounded by people that don't like them,

202
00:21:35,420 --> 00:21:39,740
there may be connections built to as a as a safety mechanism.

203
00:21:40,340 --> 00:21:43,640
You know, people in the like in sexual, gender, minority communities,

204
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:48,140
people are like, well, why do you have this like, you know, a word salad of LGBT?

205
00:21:48,440 --> 00:21:56,790
Q A All these other things and people often, you know, we're talking about is in my work in activism, that area,

206
00:21:57,230 --> 00:22:00,890
sometimes you have to come together collectively because you're all experiencing

207
00:22:01,130 --> 00:22:04,970
some type of oppression related to either your sexuality or your gender or both.

208
00:22:05,540 --> 00:22:13,040
So sometimes and then there can be divisions too, because there's a lot of folks who are maybe trans and non-binary identified who might feel like,

209
00:22:13,610 --> 00:22:16,700
you know, other LGBT spaces are not really that friendly.

210
00:22:17,300 --> 00:22:25,070
So it gets it gets complicated. And then, yeah, one question that came to mind was like, if you're part of multiple kids,

211
00:22:25,070 --> 00:22:32,240
but then you have a couple other people that are different communities, you have these entities like at what point is it right?

212
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:37,340
You're like, It's large enough to be considered a community by an individual, one particular.

213
00:22:37,850 --> 00:22:39,530
Yeah, that's a really great point.

214
00:22:39,830 --> 00:22:50,959
I don't know the answer to that, but I think that, you know, I'm kind of like dig in this concept of intersectional communities now and thinking,

215
00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:55,040
you know, yeah, I mean, it's kind of the same way with intersectional identities.

216
00:22:55,040 --> 00:22:57,109
I trying to think of the parallels, you know,

217
00:22:57,110 --> 00:23:04,610
so you could imagine sometimes it may be hard to find those other people, but then you might start to build more.

218
00:23:05,090 --> 00:23:06,560
I don't know. That's a really good point.

219
00:23:06,920 --> 00:23:14,030
I was actually just talking about that this morning with one of my colleagues at Emory that I do work with in both nursing Kenya.

220
00:23:14,330 --> 00:23:21,140
She's her dad, is an immigrant from Ethiopia and her mom from Japan.

221
00:23:21,560 --> 00:23:29,720
And so she was just talking about being either a Japanese Ethiopian or an Ethiopian in Japanese,

222
00:23:29,990 --> 00:23:40,160
but then about to how she very rarely finds other people that have a shared immigrant Japanese Ethiopian identity.

223
00:23:40,610 --> 00:23:45,200
Um, yeah. I mean, I would yeah. It's interesting I pose that question I heard is they are you know,

224
00:23:45,560 --> 00:23:50,360
some of you may have those answers like at what point does it become like another community?

225
00:23:50,870 --> 00:23:57,439
That's a really good question. And I kind of wanted to talk about like because within the United States,

226
00:23:57,440 --> 00:24:04,160
we're so busy with like work and like whatever it might be like, like family oriented structures.

227
00:24:04,550 --> 00:24:06,770
Whereas like if you go to other areas of the world,

228
00:24:06,770 --> 00:24:13,250
community is such an important place and like people literally have streets that are named after like,

229
00:24:13,760 --> 00:24:19,430
you know, different community groups specifically because it's part of the culture.

230
00:24:19,760 --> 00:24:25,520
So like be really adamant within the community and also just yeah.

231
00:24:25,520 --> 00:24:30,469
So I mean like for example, I think of like, like for me like, like, like back home,

232
00:24:30,470 --> 00:24:37,490
like it is, it would be an insult to not be really like, you know, part of your community.

233
00:24:37,490 --> 00:24:39,680
Yeah, somebody might.

234
00:24:39,680 --> 00:24:45,650
So, for example, like dinner or something like somebody might cook dinner and then that person takes that to the whole community.

235
00:24:46,050 --> 00:24:52,670
And so like little things like that. Whereas like you're very much a part of people as if like you're a big family.

236
00:24:53,330 --> 00:24:56,750
So I just see like a different definition of community.

237
00:24:57,110 --> 00:24:58,759
So I think that's a great point.

238
00:24:58,760 --> 00:25:05,630
I think, you know, when we're doing global work, we need to be thoughtful that like I was just saying and like in Kenya,

239
00:25:06,020 --> 00:25:15,200
I'm sure before, this is like ritual washing someone when it's their birthday in public spaces, they pour drinks over you.

240
00:25:15,560 --> 00:25:19,430
But then the other thing is when you bring a cake, you feed everyone in the restaurant.

241
00:25:19,910 --> 00:25:26,510
You don't just like feed the people with you, but you literally go through the entire restaurant and you give everyone a piece of your cake.

242
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:33,620
So you had to be really careful. If you want to have your birthday celebration in a large place, need a huge asking.

243
00:25:34,700 --> 00:25:39,440
You know, in some places they actually like the person will feed every single person.

244
00:25:39,740 --> 00:25:43,250
So it's not just like sharing, but you literally go to every single person.

245
00:25:43,280 --> 00:25:44,150
To work in the restaurant.

246
00:25:44,330 --> 00:25:51,220
Now, if you do that in the U.S., you know you're going to get your hand broken probably in the case mass because they're like, What are you doing?

247
00:25:51,260 --> 00:25:56,719
Get out of my face. But that is a really good point there, especially working in different spaces.

248
00:25:56,720 --> 00:26:04,280
Different countries are even kind of like ethnic enclaves within the U.S. who maintain some of that.

249
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:07,660
You know, that that ritual to.

250
00:26:07,980 --> 00:26:13,070
To really think about for them what is community and that's a really, really good point.

251
00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:20,330
I always love to think about how I get and try and draw those connections. Anything else on Community?

252
00:26:20,330 --> 00:26:25,490
I may just throw the rest of slides away because you all are touching on a lot of what.

253
00:26:27,190 --> 00:26:31,360
Kind of like scholars and other people to talk about in their lives. Yeah. I mean, I don't know.

254
00:26:31,360 --> 00:26:38,970
Just think about how like community has shifted since COVID especially and how like virtual spaces has become like how well,

255
00:26:38,980 --> 00:26:41,650
you know, like communities not just really limited to geographic spaces.

256
00:26:41,650 --> 00:26:46,180
I think that's become especially true in the last few years where we're connecting with people who are so far outside

257
00:26:46,780 --> 00:26:51,980
spaces that I think that's just like a whole new element that has changed the way that we understand community.

258
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:52,959
Yeah, yeah.

259
00:26:52,960 --> 00:27:02,500
I think with virtual spaces being more common, you know, in some ways that's increased, you know, the different communities we can belong to because,

260
00:27:02,860 --> 00:27:12,400
you know, there's people I had a one of my first in-person meetings with like different people within yesterday.

261
00:27:12,670 --> 00:27:19,570
And there are people that I have never seen in person that I saw in person for the first time because we've been virtual.

262
00:27:19,990 --> 00:27:25,210
So that is a really good point. That would be really interesting. I'm sure someone studying this for a dissertation somewhere.

263
00:27:26,230 --> 00:27:32,350
You know how our definition of community has changed after COVID and I could see

264
00:27:32,350 --> 00:27:36,580
both benefits and challenges to the new definitions that we're going to have some.

265
00:27:37,270 --> 00:27:40,540
Okay. Question for you.

266
00:27:40,990 --> 00:27:49,200
What is. What role does privilege play in community?

267
00:27:49,770 --> 00:28:00,300
So and what I mean is how does having privilege intersect with the types of communities you may be part of?

268
00:28:00,690 --> 00:28:05,130
Or your affinity toward particular communities? What role does privilege play?

269
00:28:05,490 --> 00:28:15,010
That is excuse me, I think like one role, I guess, or aspect would be kind of your role in the community of privilege.

270
00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:20,870
Like, I'm just thinking like people may be more likely to see you as like a community leader.

271
00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:33,480
You have more variety, like maybe like school or like like local, like, like town communities where people like you, like on the PTA board.

272
00:28:33,720 --> 00:28:39,940
Like I think pretty predominantly most of the parents on that are usually like upper middle class or higher son.

273
00:28:39,960 --> 00:28:45,390
Like, they're more the community leaders. And I've noticed, like in my community or like my home town,

274
00:28:46,470 --> 00:28:53,070
I think the same could be applied to like various communities, whether it's religious or like based on where you live.

275
00:28:54,750 --> 00:28:59,730
Yeah. Yeah. And I was just saying is you're talking to like with the PTA example.

276
00:28:59,940 --> 00:29:07,860
I mean, that takes a lot of time. But if you're like a single father and you're got three kids and two jobs, you don't have to do that yet.

277
00:29:08,220 --> 00:29:13,430
But if someone else has like that, that money, that power, that privilege, a lot easier to do.

278
00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:19,310
Yeah. I was just gonna say, like, the privilege to be part of, like, a normal, like,

279
00:29:19,350 --> 00:29:25,440
majority group and how comfortable you feel expressing that even you are.

280
00:29:26,250 --> 00:29:29,430
You're part of the community. You're identity community.

281
00:29:30,130 --> 00:29:35,850
I mean, that makes a lot of residents only a little bit more comfortable.

282
00:29:35,850 --> 00:29:44,580
You feel like any setting express a part of your identity and that identity like is your heart is what like puts you in a community.

283
00:29:44,820 --> 00:29:50,670
Right. I think I the first part and I mean, if you have privilege,

284
00:29:50,880 --> 00:29:57,790
it may be easier to express yourself in different communities because I mean, with privilege comes power.

285
00:29:57,810 --> 00:30:02,010
Right. So and you may have a higher degree of comfort because you don't have as much to lose.

286
00:30:02,010 --> 00:30:11,480
Is that kind of just like we all probably have different communities and identities right now and being part of like a majority community, right.

287
00:30:11,580 --> 00:30:15,070
Is a privilege and you might to work on. I gotcha. Capable.

288
00:30:15,210 --> 00:30:24,880
Yeah. Okay. I gotcha. And I like to go to people to.

289
00:30:31,180 --> 00:30:40,350
She can become the person responding to those that are underrepresented.

290
00:30:41,960 --> 00:30:49,760
Most of the issues. The second point I was thinking about is that there's a lot.

291
00:30:50,990 --> 00:30:54,870
People who are. Or like, I guess like.

292
00:31:00,030 --> 00:31:07,710
And so for them, they don't have as much. I think they have more liberty and also they don't have to.

293
00:31:09,240 --> 00:31:13,080
Their actions of how their people work.

294
00:31:16,470 --> 00:31:22,350
I mean, it's like something out there, right?

295
00:31:22,860 --> 00:31:24,979
So I want to make sure I'm track, right.

296
00:31:24,980 --> 00:31:34,040
So on the second point, it's kind of like if you're in a Minoritized community group, there's more surveillance of what you're doing.

297
00:31:34,850 --> 00:31:41,930
Right. I gotcha. And I think with the first point, what I heard you say is that if you're some privileged groups,

298
00:31:42,380 --> 00:31:47,210
privileged communities may oppress other communities because they have power, privilege, other things.

299
00:31:47,240 --> 00:31:54,200
Okay. Thank you for that. I was going to say that in like groups that are privileged,

300
00:31:54,200 --> 00:32:00,319
community is of less importance to the members of the group because of the fact that privilege kind

301
00:32:00,320 --> 00:32:08,510
of implies that you are the norm and that you are kind of the default and therefore like community,

302
00:32:08,510 --> 00:32:15,800
which is based on a special ward, some sort of unique kind of identity experience because there is kind of you're

303
00:32:15,810 --> 00:32:19,340
seen as the default that doesn't really exist within you and therefore,

304
00:32:19,340 --> 00:32:27,130
you know, necessarily bond to other members of your community as mostly because you're just kind of seen as, oh, everyone's just kind of like me.

305
00:32:27,140 --> 00:32:30,660
There's no need for like specific communities. Right. Yeah.

306
00:32:30,780 --> 00:32:37,580
Yeah. That's an excellent point. I think when you are part of the majority, when you have that privilege.

307
00:32:38,630 --> 00:32:45,230
The world is your oyster, right? So you don't need a particular community where you belong because you belong everywhere.

308
00:32:45,630 --> 00:32:47,120
I'm just one observation.

309
00:32:47,120 --> 00:32:56,150
I like to make your observation process, though I would encourage everyone to take the word normal and norm and take it out of your vocabulary.

310
00:32:57,500 --> 00:33:00,530
The reason I would encourage you to talk more about majority,

311
00:33:01,790 --> 00:33:10,730
because we often equate majority with normal and that has dangerous implications for things like mental health and for other areas.

312
00:33:10,760 --> 00:33:15,409
So just just know that, you know, you can choose, you do what you want.

313
00:33:15,410 --> 00:33:21,890
But I always like, I think being a psychologist every time I hear that word, norm or normal, I'm always kind of cringing.

314
00:33:22,910 --> 00:33:29,150
And so just yeah, again, critical self-reflection. Think about what that word means and the way that that may carry.

315
00:33:29,830 --> 00:33:35,270
Yeah. So many hands each year that we're going to go across this, right?

316
00:33:35,300 --> 00:33:38,750
Okay. Okay. And privilege, I guess,

317
00:33:38,750 --> 00:33:44,569
like help someone mask their community or that they're a part of that because that in

318
00:33:44,570 --> 00:33:49,640
itself could be a privilege or like give you more power to be a part of that community.

319
00:33:49,760 --> 00:33:55,910
Yeah. Yeah. So, like, let's say that you are someone living with a disability and maybe you have a connection to a disability community,

320
00:33:56,150 --> 00:33:59,870
but you don't want anyone to know when you have that privilege, you could totally mask it.

321
00:33:59,990 --> 00:34:07,910
Yeah. Yeah. So I was thinking more in a physical sense, but with privilege usually comes more access to resources with privilege,

322
00:34:07,910 --> 00:34:13,280
and might make a community look more like a community in that the doctor's office will be there,

323
00:34:13,280 --> 00:34:17,450
the grocery store will be there and school will be there. So they'll have more of those connections within.

324
00:34:17,660 --> 00:34:19,660
Yeah. Versus those who might not be in the majority.

325
00:34:19,670 --> 00:34:24,830
That community might not seem the same if they need to, like, travel greater distances to access those.

326
00:34:25,340 --> 00:34:31,610
Yeah. Yeah. And that's an excellent point. And one thing that can be connected to that is if you look at the literature,

327
00:34:31,610 --> 00:34:35,330
I like the built environment and the effect that the built environment has on health.

328
00:34:35,750 --> 00:34:41,059
You know, when you have spaces where you can play, spaces where you can walk,

329
00:34:41,060 --> 00:34:46,430
spaces where you can get fresh fruits and vegetables, your, you know, your health indicators go up.

330
00:34:46,850 --> 00:34:52,310
And so those people that have all those things are going to have better health outcomes.

331
00:34:52,490 --> 00:34:55,910
One thing I would challenge you just throw in there, though, too,

332
00:34:57,290 --> 00:35:15,140
is I would I would and I would wonder as the community becomes are has more resources, what what happens to the emotional connection, you know,

333
00:35:15,170 --> 00:35:22,190
because when you collect more things you become less human kind of going back to Walmart and killers

334
00:35:22,520 --> 00:35:27,200
point and I definitely seen that in like the different countries I worked in in sub-Saharan Africa,

335
00:35:27,410 --> 00:35:37,190
some of the communities that I work in and they have very little resources, but their connection to each other is fierce.

336
00:35:37,790 --> 00:35:44,330
You know, it's so connected and some of that may be having to come together because of oppression.

337
00:35:44,450 --> 00:35:49,730
But, you know, I always think about that because I think as we collect objects, we get less,

338
00:35:50,300 --> 00:35:55,220
we get more away from the personal and the human and more connected to the objects.

339
00:35:55,220 --> 00:36:02,420
So we may have a better physical health indicator. But I just wonder, I don't know the answer what may be happening elsewhere.

340
00:36:02,600 --> 00:36:07,459
And I think what's next. And I'm kind of I don't know if this point was already said,

341
00:36:07,460 --> 00:36:15,470
but just like the privilege to have to be the majority and have to not really struggle to find your own right to.

342
00:36:15,530 --> 00:36:22,880
Build your community and just having the privilege, like so many said, to already be the majority so you don't even have to have community.

343
00:36:23,270 --> 00:36:28,639
And then also, like I was just thinking about the point about the woman who said it was Japanese,

344
00:36:28,640 --> 00:36:34,820
Ethiopian, like the privilege just to her to have to probably struggle to find someone who is like her.

345
00:36:35,180 --> 00:36:41,330
And as well as the other point mentioned about the PTA or whatever,

346
00:36:41,660 --> 00:36:51,020
just having the privilege to have the time and the resources to strengthen your own community instead of just worrying about them.

347
00:36:51,500 --> 00:36:57,950
Yeah. And some people, you know, I think to the point of like people needing to find means people may be searching for their

348
00:36:57,950 --> 00:37:03,020
community for a really long time and may never even find a community that they feel comfortable.

349
00:37:04,770 --> 00:37:09,350
Yeah, like I agree with the things that people so far have said.

350
00:37:09,500 --> 00:37:14,510
Well, I guess based on my experiences, the first thing that I thought of, and this is something that I kind of thought of in the past,

351
00:37:14,750 --> 00:37:22,400
but like how sometimes with more privileges you can have closer relationships because of the overlapping communities.

352
00:37:22,700 --> 00:37:29,210
So like based on my experiences, like the middle class black Detroit community is so like everybody knows each other.

353
00:37:29,270 --> 00:37:34,280
And I think part of that is because like our middle class has in the same community.

354
00:37:34,370 --> 00:37:38,190
So like I knew a lot of black people in this room before even coming to college.

355
00:37:38,530 --> 00:37:43,629
And I think part of that is because we were like in different words together, like there are things that I'm going to say,

356
00:37:43,630 --> 00:37:48,860
I was like three years old and and then I'll come to kind of like, like a sorority,

357
00:37:48,860 --> 00:37:53,479
you know, how like sometimes, like, black sororities, like you'll you'll know that person.

358
00:37:53,480 --> 00:37:57,860
I mean, you'll be in the same, like, community with that person, but you don't even know them now like that.

359
00:37:57,860 --> 00:38:00,500
When I came to Michigan, I was like, Oh, we're both in this board.

360
00:38:00,710 --> 00:38:07,820
So I feel like and then also like people will look out for you, like people within, like the middle class black community,

361
00:38:07,820 --> 00:38:13,820
like your parents or your grandparents, like they'll keep an eye out for their kids and like make sure they're safe for like that.

362
00:38:13,820 --> 00:38:17,300
People in their circles, like, kind of know what's going on with that.

363
00:38:17,630 --> 00:38:20,180
So I feel like it's not always like a negative thing,

364
00:38:20,180 --> 00:38:25,790
but maybe that's because it's like not just a privileged to be like financially, but like we are black.

365
00:38:25,790 --> 00:38:31,280
So like maybe this like kind of intersectionality of it. But I don't necessarily feel like it's always negative.

366
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:35,660
No, I think that's a really great point. And so these are kind of composites as well.

367
00:38:35,670 --> 00:38:46,309
And people are actually thinking about things, you know, because I think the like and actually it's so funny because I was just talking to a student,

368
00:38:46,310 --> 00:38:53,360
I saw a program the senior night and she was like about a year and you know, so she was like talking about all these points of connection.

369
00:38:53,360 --> 00:39:03,260
So it's funny that you bring that up in the class, but I think having some identities that are privileged and then others that aren't,

370
00:39:03,890 --> 00:39:07,490
you know, it could be that those privileged identities.

371
00:39:07,910 --> 00:39:14,660
Terms of like income mobility help you band together to attack, you know,

372
00:39:15,140 --> 00:39:25,590
to to present counter-narratives to those oppressive forces and to actually have collective resistance to those.

373
00:39:25,610 --> 00:39:26,929
So yeah, I think that's a really good point.

374
00:39:26,930 --> 00:39:36,260
Whereas if you had multiple minoritized and marginalized community memberships, it may be harder to band together, to fight and to resist.

375
00:39:36,770 --> 00:39:43,549
But when you have, you know, at least one or more that are a little more elevated, then it could be, like you said,

376
00:39:43,550 --> 00:39:54,170
that it could be even better than having to, you know, privilege ones where there isn't that connectedness and there is of that shared.

377
00:39:54,530 --> 00:39:57,710
That's really cool. Let's go up here.

378
00:39:57,720 --> 00:40:02,870
Green thingy. And then when did you become active?

379
00:40:04,640 --> 00:40:11,990
Okay. All right. Well, I was going to say, I think it's a privilege to be able to say that your family is your community,

380
00:40:11,990 --> 00:40:17,420
because I have a pretty big family and we're all really close. And I know it's not the same for everyone.

381
00:40:17,720 --> 00:40:23,570
And so I feel like that's difficult because your family is people that you interact with probably every day.

382
00:40:23,570 --> 00:40:26,980
And if you don't consider them community, then it can be pretty awful.

383
00:40:27,260 --> 00:40:35,840
Yeah. Good point. I get a voice that going back, my family's not you.

384
00:40:36,200 --> 00:40:45,830
So there are parts where when you don't have that like built in community, you know, it's there's not that safety net.

385
00:40:46,340 --> 00:40:56,220
Sometimes that's really multiple people sometimes are like nested communities where a small one can be also part of a bigger one.

386
00:40:56,360 --> 00:41:07,939
Yeah, but I feel like at the same time for each of the smaller communities that they like have kind of presence, like the people in the outer circles.

387
00:41:07,940 --> 00:41:10,940
Like, I'm just thinking of a community. Yeah, sure. I'm part of.

388
00:41:12,090 --> 00:41:17,220
Yeah, just thinking, like. Do you think. That is possible.

389
00:41:17,790 --> 00:41:23,350
But through their shared experiences, they kind of like put that.

390
00:41:24,570 --> 00:41:27,660
And felt like the privilege over them.

391
00:41:28,110 --> 00:41:33,239
Yeah, I mean, I think so. I think, you know, I mean, that's what's so interesting about this whole concept of community,

392
00:41:33,240 --> 00:41:37,979
right, is that it's kind of an amorphous, like, socially constructed phenomenon in some ways.

393
00:41:37,980 --> 00:41:46,770
That was a lot of geeky word to use in an academic way to like, Well, if you want me to say that again.

394
00:41:46,770 --> 00:41:51,690
But in England, well, I think normal people. But yeah, no, I think that you know,

395
00:41:52,290 --> 00:42:00,029
I think that's a really good point because you could have like a and they use this word in on when you go to some community,

396
00:42:00,030 --> 00:42:08,310
you know, I hate that word. So because um, that's a lot less than anyway but a separate community within that.

397
00:42:08,940 --> 00:42:13,530
So you say like that community then kind of out privilege in other parts?

398
00:42:13,800 --> 00:42:17,880
Yeah, I think so because you could because in having a tight community,

399
00:42:17,910 --> 00:42:27,120
you can gain more privilege and more power and more resistance because you have a shared I talking about like a shared purpose, shared focus.

400
00:42:27,480 --> 00:42:31,500
So yeah, I could see how you could kind of like push out other people. Yeah, that's a really good point.

401
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:35,220
That's going to zero, dude. It didn't come back.

402
00:42:35,430 --> 00:42:39,270
Okay. Yeah. So two things.

403
00:42:39,570 --> 00:42:49,710
One, I want to mention about having a privileged identity like I'm thinking more about or you know,

404
00:42:49,800 --> 00:42:56,970
you might mean that you don't have a specific organization because you are like you're looking at the university.

405
00:42:56,970 --> 00:43:05,310
That's what you see. Yeah. I feel like you see a lot of organizations based off of, um, let's say, lucky for me,

406
00:43:05,310 --> 00:43:11,910
I'm thinking about like the Bangladeshi Student Association or like the Muslim minority here.

407
00:43:11,910 --> 00:43:18,960
So it's very easy. Like, it's like sort of the thing to one event together with people that have something.

408
00:43:20,250 --> 00:43:24,420
And having that community might give you like a sense of identity and belonging.

409
00:43:25,260 --> 00:43:36,000
And then another thing based off of what you said, I think it's definitely possible for there to be sub communities in a community that privilege.

410
00:43:37,080 --> 00:43:44,190
Like for me, I'm thinking about again the Bangladeshi Student Association, a lot of the people in it are from the same area.

411
00:43:44,580 --> 00:43:48,360
So, you know, you have that identity right away.

412
00:43:48,360 --> 00:43:52,679
You know, you have that connection. And if you don't have that shared identity,

413
00:43:52,680 --> 00:43:58,320
it could be like that moment when you walk into a room and you don't know anyone, you just might be, like, anxious.

414
00:43:59,130 --> 00:44:02,220
It could sort of, you know, minoritized a group.

415
00:44:02,250 --> 00:44:06,989
Yeah, we're awesome. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

416
00:44:06,990 --> 00:44:09,990
I was going to say, like, kind of come back to the idea of, like,

417
00:44:10,260 --> 00:44:14,310
privilege interacting with community communities, which are like positions of privilege.

418
00:44:15,340 --> 00:44:24,310
I think the goal of the community starts to become more oriented about maintaining kind of power and privilege, even if they don't see it.

419
00:44:24,820 --> 00:44:31,250
Yeah. Rather than because the community is not in a position or more about those connections.

420
00:44:31,280 --> 00:44:37,810
Yeah. Including everyone in the community. Because I think one of the things I could think of is like I feel like in a lot of white,

421
00:44:38,560 --> 00:44:42,430
white communities, like the bonding organizations might be like the PTA,

422
00:44:42,580 --> 00:44:50,979
but each away kind of these churches kind of are like political institutions which kind of push kind

423
00:44:50,980 --> 00:44:56,350
of narratives and agendas and other people to try to maintain their positions from time to time.

424
00:44:56,680 --> 00:45:01,370
That's a really good point. Yeah, I think about like Trump automatically takeover my mind.

425
00:45:01,420 --> 00:45:08,590
You think about like Trumpian communities. And I said, you know what else?

426
00:45:08,750 --> 00:45:14,130
But yeah, I mean, but you're right. I mean, because they're all about right now grabbing power, right?

427
00:45:14,150 --> 00:45:19,300
Because they're like starting to get nervous. And so it's like, what can we do to get more power?

428
00:45:19,510 --> 00:45:23,740
As opposed to how can we celebrate each other, support each other, grow?

429
00:45:24,040 --> 00:45:29,190
Yeah. Yeah. And so, yeah, I think either way.

430
00:45:29,200 --> 00:45:36,880
Yeah. So I kind of wanted to talk about and I guess like everybody here, I just like hearing how we all have different experiences with community.

431
00:45:37,450 --> 00:45:42,760
But I think something that I thought about, like with the Public Health Initiative too, is, are like public health in mind.

432
00:45:43,330 --> 00:45:51,010
Is that like specifically for me, I think that community has played a huge role in my life and I think it's because like one

433
00:45:51,010 --> 00:45:55,980
thing I think of it is like during Ramadan and how we have like these dinners every week.

434
00:45:55,990 --> 00:46:01,400
And that in itself is a public health, I guess like intervention.

435
00:46:01,570 --> 00:46:11,560
And I'm thinking about how we supply dinners to or anyone's like big, big groups of people have dropped in like a moment until like every Friday.

436
00:46:11,860 --> 00:46:18,969
And then I remember like every Monday, Wednesday, we do a distribution to the elderly, so we would like drop off food to their house.

437
00:46:18,970 --> 00:46:23,709
And I think that's something that I'm just really proud of,

438
00:46:23,710 --> 00:46:30,280
is how much of my faith has centered my idea of community and knowledge, just like within the like Islamic faith.

439
00:46:30,280 --> 00:46:36,249
And you hear it on news stations and things like that. But like a lot of the times our goal is to give back.

440
00:46:36,250 --> 00:46:38,380
And that is just something that I was taught growing up.

441
00:46:38,770 --> 00:46:45,110
And I think that's played a significant role in my community and the idea of white communities.

442
00:46:45,920 --> 00:46:51,100
So, you know, whether it be like, you know, doing like volunteer service every week or whatever it is.

443
00:46:51,100 --> 00:46:55,390
And I think a lot of faith based groups and faith based organizations do that.

444
00:46:56,110 --> 00:47:02,590
But I think that specifically, like Ramadan, is really where the community aspect comes into play, and that's why I think that works.

445
00:47:02,980 --> 00:47:09,100
Yeah, well, thanks for sharing. And I think that's a beautiful counter-narrative to kind of like, you know,

446
00:47:09,670 --> 00:47:14,830
anti-Muslim, anti-Arab, American rhetoric and all that other kind of stuff.

447
00:47:15,160 --> 00:47:19,260
And I think that yeah, and I do think that, you know,

448
00:47:19,270 --> 00:47:25,450
I really would encourage all of you to think about like all your different communities and kind of what role they played in your life.

449
00:47:25,810 --> 00:47:34,450
Because then when you're working with communities, these again are humans who are part of a collective, but they also may have had shared experiences.

450
00:47:34,450 --> 00:47:38,200
Are that things like that. Yeah. So I'd just like to go back to what room was talking about,

451
00:47:38,200 --> 00:47:43,300
about family because I am lucky enough to have a family where we're all very close and I have that support system,

452
00:47:43,780 --> 00:47:47,439
but I don't have the privilege of being physically close to the mountains of miles away.

453
00:47:47,440 --> 00:47:51,880
I see them once a year and I feel like that's a different level of privilege, especially because.

454
00:47:52,630 --> 00:47:55,420
Okay, so for those of you who are from Michigan, I am from Grosse Pointe.

455
00:47:55,420 --> 00:47:58,810
There's not a lot of cultural connection that happens with me where I'm from.

456
00:47:59,620 --> 00:48:01,630
The only other Mexican kid at my school was my little brother.

457
00:48:01,870 --> 00:48:06,969
And so that it's just I feel like in terms of what you were talking about, I'm sorry, I forgot your name,

458
00:48:06,970 --> 00:48:15,190
but he was talking a lot about how like a lot of in white communities that comes back to power and the things that they bond over our power.

459
00:48:15,190 --> 00:48:18,730
And I feel like with me in the communities, I'm searching for it. In Michigan,

460
00:48:19,030 --> 00:48:24,730
it's a lot about like connecting with my culture and finding that sort of support system like it's power is not at the top of my family, right?

461
00:48:24,760 --> 00:48:28,840
Is that like we just want to stay connected to our roots because that's not something we have here.

462
00:48:28,900 --> 00:48:34,090
Yeah, that's an interest because it kind of like fits in with like kind of Maslow's hierarchy of needs, right?

463
00:48:34,090 --> 00:48:39,880
So when you have more power and privilege, you don't have to deal with just like the basic survival stuff, right?

464
00:48:40,210 --> 00:48:43,600
Because like, you're just like, find someone who actually is, you know,

465
00:48:43,780 --> 00:48:49,030
that has a shared experience with you and you can use different phrases or have food and be,

466
00:48:49,120 --> 00:48:54,100
you know, someone who worked in the Mexican-American community in Chicago for years.

467
00:48:54,220 --> 00:49:00,530
The food here is [INAUDIBLE], right? So like finding real Mexican food does not exist, I think, in most of Michigan to go home.

468
00:49:00,730 --> 00:49:08,650
Right, exactly. So I think that's a really good point is like depending on your level of connectedness in your community,

469
00:49:08,980 --> 00:49:14,860
you may be, yeah, depending on what level you are of survival and again, that.

470
00:49:15,950 --> 00:49:17,360
One time. It's all back to Paula Cole.

471
00:49:17,390 --> 00:49:24,290
Think about if you're doing interventions right and you're trying to work with people who don't have those connections in community.

472
00:49:24,500 --> 00:49:30,340
If you're trying to get them to engage in some higher order fame, they'll be like, I don't really care about that [INAUDIBLE].

473
00:49:30,350 --> 00:49:33,820
Like, I just want to feel normal or I want to feel even.

474
00:49:33,840 --> 00:49:41,540
I just said not to use that. I'm striking that now, but I just want to feel like everyone else or I just want to feel.

475
00:49:41,810 --> 00:49:44,300
I want to be seen. I want to be heard.

476
00:49:44,690 --> 00:49:51,620
I want to not be mistaken for someone from another ethnic group, you know, or my name being jumbled and messed up all the time.

477
00:49:51,740 --> 00:49:54,800
Although I know I do that all the time and I do apologize. It's an age thing.

478
00:49:54,860 --> 00:50:00,710
I think our traumatic brain injury I've had a couple, so, you know, you never know what they are.

479
00:50:01,460 --> 00:50:03,170
But yeah, but I think that's a really good point. Yeah,

480
00:50:03,860 --> 00:50:15,829
I remember like kind of going back to something that kind of tends to help people privilege and abuse tend to try to dominate conversations

481
00:50:15,830 --> 00:50:22,850
or like sort of any sort of issues or like facilitating these roles in the communities and just kind of been like referenced or talked about.

482
00:50:23,300 --> 00:50:29,300
Um, a lot of the time they tend to make like this monolithic kind of experience based on like,

483
00:50:31,850 --> 00:50:36,860
you know, trying to, like, it's just like this lack of individualizing.

484
00:50:36,860 --> 00:50:43,760
People like understand that like an experience within a community, it can be really helpful.

485
00:50:44,290 --> 00:50:48,409
Like, like you're not in a way is like and a lot of, like cultural community is like.

486
00:50:48,410 --> 00:50:52,700
I remember I read this article over the summer, I think credibility,

487
00:50:53,300 --> 00:51:01,090
especially amongst a lot of like Southeast Asian communities and Filipino-American and with so on,

488
00:51:01,100 --> 00:51:05,050
I'm assuming kind of apply like a lot of the times people in positions of power,

489
00:51:05,060 --> 00:51:13,280
privileged positions, attempt to try and make like the rhetoric, like conversations about like very kind of surface level engagement and like,

490
00:51:13,310 --> 00:51:19,550
yes, it's an appreciation of culture, but at the same time, it's like laughing about issues about what's happening.

491
00:51:20,120 --> 00:51:29,870
Why are people talking about colors when you're talking about issues that are divided minoritized groups struggle with back in home countries?

492
00:51:31,420 --> 00:51:38,830
Yeah, that's a good point. I think, you know, for for people who are from privilege identities or privilege groups or privilege, you know,

493
00:51:38,840 --> 00:51:45,469
communities and doing public health interventions, we do have to think about our position ality and our power, you know,

494
00:51:45,470 --> 00:51:50,800
and and I'm all too often and Michael overwork seeing things, you know,

495
00:51:50,810 --> 00:51:57,049
sometimes well-meaning white straight cis folks who come in and want to talk to

496
00:51:57,050 --> 00:52:02,420
a particular community like they are so knowledgeable about that community.

497
00:52:02,810 --> 00:52:10,880
And not too long ago I had a social situation where someone was doing that and I kept trying to shut her down because,

498
00:52:11,240 --> 00:52:16,250
you know, you can you can read the room, right? I mean, you can see would be like, oh, my God, this crazy white lady.

499
00:52:17,480 --> 00:52:25,160
And so finally, I just stopped the meeting and said, I think this is a really good time for a break.

500
00:52:25,460 --> 00:52:34,490
You know, let's let's take a break. The nice thing in and a lot of, you know, former British colonies in sub-Saharan Africa is tea time is big.

501
00:52:34,490 --> 00:52:41,569
So, you know, I had an instant tea break and had to go like Poehler aside and say you were

502
00:52:41,570 --> 00:52:48,350
totally dominating this whole conversation about the gay community in this,

503
00:52:48,350 --> 00:52:56,690
you know, in this geographic region. And she's like, oh, I didn't need to, you know, all this got started do a little white fragility stuff.

504
00:52:56,690 --> 00:53:00,260
And I had nothing polar back. So, like, can't be with your drama right now.

505
00:53:00,860 --> 00:53:04,670
Focus on the community. We're here for them. We're not here for you.

506
00:53:06,950 --> 00:53:10,310
But a lot of times there's not that person there to kind of like pull the cord.

507
00:53:10,430 --> 00:53:14,870
Right. And so people just keep going with with that.

508
00:53:15,640 --> 00:53:18,049
Yeah. These are kind of like two things.

509
00:53:18,050 --> 00:53:28,100
Like one, I thought of kind of like the loss of community and like how that can be advantageous or just words are like a disadvantage.

510
00:53:29,840 --> 00:53:34,520
I kind of think like here I want to change or something.

511
00:53:34,520 --> 00:53:38,309
Like you only lose one community but maybe another.

512
00:53:38,310 --> 00:53:43,250
We're like coming to college. Like, I think like a lot of people like experience,

513
00:53:43,250 --> 00:53:54,410
like a loss of community when I feel like literally just like not being certain about people's identities and like kind of how devastating back to.

514
00:53:57,000 --> 00:54:07,110
And then my second point was like kind of like the discourse, like between communities about between like one community, about other communities.

515
00:54:07,110 --> 00:54:11,729
Like the first example I would think of how that discourse could either be like harmful

516
00:54:11,730 --> 00:54:17,810
or advantageous like street communities is like how like the neurotypical community,

517
00:54:17,820 --> 00:54:27,180
like discourse on like neurodivergent people and how harmful that can be until like you're talking and you realize the person

518
00:54:27,180 --> 00:54:36,120
is like neurodivergent or like knows somebody and kind of just a privilege that comes with like being a certain community,

519
00:54:36,130 --> 00:54:40,920
like being neurotypical and thinking. You can say just like whatever the [INAUDIBLE] right is, okay?

520
00:54:41,010 --> 00:54:49,350
Until like, like for example, like a person's harmful, like the things people say about autism to like just other people like that.

521
00:54:49,350 --> 00:54:56,610
I've heard and then I like hit them with my brother is autistic like like not like that sort of moment.

522
00:54:57,690 --> 00:55:02,250
I don't know. And then they make lots of excuses. Yeah. Yeah. Oh no, I don't really think that way.

523
00:55:02,370 --> 00:55:14,310
Yeah. Yeah. Let's talk about yeah, I used to live in Chicago and someone from Chicago was kind of like you were kind of Chicago ish.

524
00:55:14,640 --> 00:55:21,780
But the so the L train runs through like all the major neighborhoods, right in Chicago.

525
00:55:22,020 --> 00:55:28,649
So if you ride the train enough, you can go from one neighborhood to another and it totally changes.

526
00:55:28,650 --> 00:55:32,310
Like the the train stop is decorated differently.

527
00:55:32,820 --> 00:55:36,959
Look at the people on the train. They look different, all this other stuff.

528
00:55:36,960 --> 00:55:41,640
So, you know, I'm pretty obviously a white dude.

529
00:55:41,970 --> 00:55:45,420
And so when I used to ride the train,

530
00:55:45,420 --> 00:55:53,610
I was appalled at how many times other white people would come up to me and say blatantly racist

531
00:55:54,090 --> 00:56:02,219
things because they just assumed because I'm a white guy and I don't really dress up that much.

532
00:56:02,220 --> 00:56:06,360
So, you know, I'd have on a hoodie and a leather jacket or something.

533
00:56:06,360 --> 00:56:09,810
And so they said, Oh yeah, he's one of us, you know, [INAUDIBLE].

534
00:56:10,050 --> 00:56:19,379
So they were just like, I think the problem is they would, you know, so they say things to me.

535
00:56:19,380 --> 00:56:26,550
And my favorite thing to do is say, That's a great point. I'm going to go talk to my black gay husband about that and then I'll get back with you.

536
00:56:26,550 --> 00:56:33,450
And, you know, couple of times I almost got hit. Luckily I can dodge punches pretty well,

537
00:56:34,620 --> 00:56:41,330
but it was just it blew me away with that assumption and all the privilege that, you know, people had of that space.

538
00:56:41,340 --> 00:56:47,910
And they just make that assumption just because you look a particular way that they're going to make that assumption.

539
00:56:47,970 --> 00:56:52,620
Yeah, I just I do think I first wanted to echo how good of a police officer was.

540
00:56:52,620 --> 00:56:58,590
I didn't think about it until I started thinking about all the things you miss out on when your community is thousands of miles away,

541
00:56:58,860 --> 00:57:02,939
like lack of social support is blind, but also lack of social networks and connections.

542
00:57:02,940 --> 00:57:08,400
Like, you know, I can't be like, Oh, my grandfather worked at this university, blah, blah, blah, because no one knows what that is, right?

543
00:57:09,240 --> 00:57:11,899
This is so dark. But one time my senior year English teacher,

544
00:57:11,900 --> 00:57:18,180
it was like she called me irresponsible for taking a week out of school to go see my family and didn't let me make up the assignment.

545
00:57:18,180 --> 00:57:22,829
I'm like, I was 17, so I just cried. But now I'm like, Oh my God,

546
00:57:22,830 --> 00:57:28,670
that is such a privilege you have that you don't see your grandparents every three years and you can go and see them, right?

547
00:57:29,520 --> 00:57:31,130
So yeah, that's a great point. Thanks for bringing that up.

548
00:57:31,350 --> 00:57:35,549
And then the second thing I wanted to talk about was we've been back to the idea of intersectional

549
00:57:35,550 --> 00:57:40,730
communities and the way the different identities that can have different privilege.

550
00:57:41,010 --> 00:57:46,979
So I was thinking about how like women and immigrant communities can't speak up about things

551
00:57:46,980 --> 00:57:51,600
like sexual assault or domestic violence for fear of losing the only community they might have.

552
00:57:51,900 --> 00:57:59,160
Or I know once we talked about an intervention with Latino women in this class where they couldn't speak up for fear of it getting worse.

553
00:57:59,260 --> 00:57:59,570
Right.

554
00:58:00,570 --> 00:58:09,420
So I wanted to add on to that because I'm in another class for sex research and we talked about a Latino community where they tried this intervention.

555
00:58:09,420 --> 00:58:13,330
I think it was in San Francisco. You know, you know what? I'm sorry, just go to another.

556
00:58:14,290 --> 00:58:19,349
And they did this intervention with Latino women and they were telling them like, oh, just stand up for yourself.

557
00:58:19,350 --> 00:58:23,009
Just tell your abuser that this has to be a certain way. And it did not work out.

558
00:58:23,010 --> 00:58:25,950
And a lot of people actually ended up getting hurt because the researchers did not

559
00:58:25,950 --> 00:58:29,279
take their community into account and they told them to do all this horrible stuff.

560
00:58:29,280 --> 00:58:32,320
And then a program I think got shut down for that. Yeah.

561
00:58:32,840 --> 00:58:37,270
Yeah, I know some of the people who are involved in that. Yeah.

562
00:58:37,290 --> 00:58:41,969
But I think, you know, again, all these conversations around, you know, kind of like distance,

563
00:58:41,970 --> 00:58:47,700
I think those are really helpful things to think about and then to what different cultural norms are,

564
00:58:48,240 --> 00:58:52,139
you know, because if, if it's normative, you know, within certain cultures,

565
00:58:52,140 --> 00:58:56,400
it may be normative to take a week off during a particular religious holiday.

566
00:58:56,400 --> 00:59:03,360
Right. And the universities are really fixed on a Judeo Christian calendar and framework.

567
00:59:04,470 --> 00:59:11,370
And that's just, you know, unfortunately, that's the way it is. And so if you do something outside of those lines or like you said,

568
00:59:11,370 --> 00:59:18,600
if like this is your first opportunity in five years to see your grandpa or your grandma sick and you haven't seen her,

569
00:59:19,050 --> 00:59:26,130
then I wouldn't call that irresponsible. I would call it very responsible by, you know, being there for your family and connecting.

570
00:59:26,490 --> 00:59:30,000
Yeah. One last point that I want to bring are two. Did you want to say something?

571
00:59:30,660 --> 00:59:38,910
Yeah, yeah. Just the personal connection I had. So in my hometown, I'm from France and my family, we go to like a Chinese church.

572
00:59:39,270 --> 00:59:45,870
I'm not religious anymore. I don't agree with a lot of their views, but I know that's a huge community for my parents.

573
00:59:45,870 --> 00:59:48,959
And so it's really hard for me to like tell them like, Hey,

574
00:59:48,960 --> 00:59:53,040
I don't think it's a good idea to go because I know it means a lot to them and

575
00:59:53,040 --> 00:59:56,129
that's a lot of where their friends are and where their social support is.

576
00:59:56,130 --> 01:00:04,440
So I had to sort of suck it up and go with them. Yeah, well, that's an excellent point, though, because if, if, if in within a community,

577
01:00:04,440 --> 01:00:09,780
if the faith space is the only space where you can connect but you still have issues with that.

578
01:00:09,780 --> 01:00:14,429
Like I've seen that a lot in, you know, folks that I work with that are sexual, gender, minorities,

579
01:00:14,430 --> 01:00:19,890
but they still keep going back to church because that's the only place where they see other folks like them.

580
01:00:20,010 --> 01:00:24,360
And just like we have different services, so we have an English service,

581
01:00:24,360 --> 01:00:29,190
a mandarin service and a Cantonese service, and the English one is the one that's doing the like the most.

582
01:00:29,640 --> 01:00:34,010
You have so many other options and you can go to other churches that align with their beliefs,

583
01:00:34,230 --> 01:00:39,030
but with the Chinese, with the Mandarin and the Cantonese, you don't really have that many options locally.

584
01:00:39,030 --> 01:00:42,239
And so they're kind of just stuck with what we have. Yeah.

585
01:00:42,240 --> 01:00:45,870
So again, like thinking about public health intervention,

586
01:00:45,870 --> 01:00:53,070
my little intervention brain is always going and I'm thinking about of the population you want to really try and engage with.

587
01:00:53,490 --> 01:01:01,890
Are Cantonese speaking Chinese Americans then working in that church, even if it's something that may not be in alignment with the faith,

588
01:01:02,400 --> 01:01:04,620
is still probably the best way to get them, you know,

589
01:01:04,620 --> 01:01:11,100
and you can't make the assumption because I've heard people say that, well, they go to church so they feel X, Y or Z way.

590
01:01:12,060 --> 01:01:18,440
That's not always true. You know, sometimes you just go to church because that's where you get to see other people like you.

591
01:01:19,170 --> 01:01:27,420
You know, it could be you. That's the place where you get to show off your clothes, you know, and have a presence.

592
01:01:27,420 --> 01:01:32,500
So there's, you know, faith communities play a large. Your role than just practicing the faith.

593
01:01:32,560 --> 01:01:39,160
And I think especially in a lot of communities where they don't have mainstream language or,

594
01:01:39,460 --> 01:01:43,570
you know, food or other things, that's a really safe space. One last comment.

595
01:01:43,900 --> 01:01:46,070
You can tell us your whole thing as writing writer.

596
01:01:46,810 --> 01:01:58,480
So I was thinking about like the like being a little more like an invisible identity within a very visible identity within that.

597
01:01:58,790 --> 01:02:03,290
So like in my case, like I'm South Asian and I like tend to like, I mean,

598
01:02:03,310 --> 01:02:07,629
I will end up gravitating towards people like when I see them because just like how it works,

599
01:02:07,630 --> 01:02:12,280
like where I was from in like Northern Virginia, but like I'm also someone like who's not neurotypical.

600
01:02:12,280 --> 01:02:17,380
I have, I have ADHD, but like, it's like so, like, stigmatized, like, within that community.

601
01:02:17,560 --> 01:02:20,889
Like, it's like, like like like about it.

602
01:02:20,890 --> 01:02:26,560
And I'll be like, oh, like, I think they're like, so lazy and I'll be there. Like, I have ADHD and they'll be like, Oh, maybe you're not.

603
01:02:26,560 --> 01:02:31,240
And it's like. And so, like, within that, you're like, Okay, who do I trust within this?

604
01:02:31,240 --> 01:02:35,020
Can you ever feel like I am part of it?

605
01:02:35,020 --> 01:02:39,070
But like within that, I have to almost, like, be on the lookout to look, right?

606
01:02:39,540 --> 01:02:45,790
Yeah, like. So it's like, you know what they're, like, safe enough to declare, like.

607
01:02:46,150 --> 01:02:54,010
Yeah, yeah, yeah. This whole concept of intersectional communities that are sexual, I think, is, I think, intersect really well.

608
01:02:54,280 --> 01:02:58,170
So we should go to the group. Oh, we only have, like, 13 minutes.

609
01:02:58,960 --> 01:03:06,850
Do you want to go to the group? You want to just keep talking? I mean, there is I said two things and then a it was like, yeah, so let's keep talking.

610
01:03:07,030 --> 01:03:11,320
All right, let's just keep talking. And then we'll do groups on Tuesday. Let's just like throw caution to the wind.

611
01:03:12,150 --> 01:03:20,440
I think we all know that we're going to vote, oh, nine months.

612
01:03:22,060 --> 01:03:27,520
We have a time here. But I want to make sure everyone has the privilege to vote.

613
01:03:27,790 --> 01:03:35,710
Yeah. All right, then, everyone. And I want to suppress how many people would like to continue to talk for the last 10 minutes.

614
01:03:37,030 --> 01:03:50,130
Okay. How many of you would like to break into group? Yeah, I did.

615
01:03:50,140 --> 01:03:55,380
I shut down anyone who wanted to say something. I would actually turn to the first line.

616
01:03:55,390 --> 01:03:58,510
Oh, my God. Did you have something like a push?

617
01:03:58,780 --> 01:04:02,109
Yeah. It's like I was thinking about. Are you just prolonging it?

618
01:04:02,110 --> 01:04:20,290
Emma So that I won't is like a lot of movies also has a nice system, the communities and like are there like any ways that, you know what?

619
01:04:22,720 --> 01:04:26,140
Yeah. People like. Yeah, that's a great, great point.

620
01:04:26,440 --> 01:04:36,610
So she talked about the, you know, communities that may have some type of ignorance or negative views of like that kind of confront that.

621
01:04:37,480 --> 01:04:41,260
I mean, that's a place where critical consciousness comes in really, really well.

622
01:04:42,400 --> 01:04:53,680
I had a colleague when I was back at DePaul who worked with white Christian church based groups around issues of racism.

623
01:04:54,970 --> 01:05:03,400
And so what he did is he developed a white racism intervention where he would work in

624
01:05:03,400 --> 01:05:09,940
groups to have people recognize the ways in which their actions were actually racist,

625
01:05:10,450 --> 01:05:20,259
even in times when they thought they were helping. And how some of their even philanthropic activities were actually the way they were

626
01:05:20,260 --> 01:05:25,089
delivered and done were racist because they made assumptions about certain communities,

627
01:05:25,090 --> 01:05:25,720
things like that.

628
01:05:27,130 --> 01:05:35,770
I know when he first started doing it, it was met with a lot of resistance and so he had to really work to think about how to frame it in a way,

629
01:05:35,770 --> 01:05:40,360
because if you come in and say all your white people are racist, we're going to help you not be racist.

630
01:05:40,630 --> 01:05:47,170
Obviously, that was going to count. So he really worked with church leaders to make it about faith.

631
01:05:47,650 --> 01:05:57,280
And so it was a faith group. And so through that, they would explore and draw parallels between Christian ideologies and racism.

632
01:05:57,670 --> 01:06:02,170
So it's like really, really cool stuff. Yeah, because they're hidden somewhere.

633
01:06:02,320 --> 01:06:05,830
Okay. I just imagined it really.

634
01:06:05,830 --> 01:06:12,430
Or it's like one. Oh, I think it is.

635
01:06:12,470 --> 01:06:17,470
And I think you've said all this.

636
01:06:18,670 --> 01:06:21,520
Right, cool. You're also smart.

637
01:06:22,750 --> 01:06:33,100
I think defining community is, you know, one thing and we've talked about all this stuff to talk about how, you know, define a community again,

638
01:06:33,360 --> 01:06:39,249
always saying about public health intervention, you've got to be really, really careful with how you define communities.

639
01:06:39,250 --> 01:06:44,740
Now, there is a there is a delicate dance when it comes to doing in public health practice,

640
01:06:45,070 --> 01:06:49,450
where sometimes you have to write a grant proposal that says one thing.

641
01:06:49,810 --> 01:06:57,790
And then when you're actually rolling it out and doing it, you do it slightly different because not all people will have that critical lens.

642
01:06:58,120 --> 01:07:00,580
And so you may have to say, okay,

643
01:07:00,760 --> 01:07:09,370
I'm dealing within this geographic region and we'll specifically focus on people with these particular identities, things like that.

644
01:07:09,370 --> 01:07:18,009
So you have to keep in mind that the people with the money have the power and the privilege, and so they're not always aware of these things.

645
01:07:18,010 --> 01:07:22,180
So you have to be kind of cautious and careful about the way you do it.

646
01:07:24,040 --> 01:07:28,780
Again, it can be very much objective assessments. Can be subjective assessments.

647
01:07:30,190 --> 01:07:33,700
Yeah. All the stuff you all talk about, we don't need to look at that.

648
01:07:34,900 --> 01:07:40,780
We're talking about geography, social identity could be a combination of geography and social identities.

649
01:07:40,780 --> 01:07:47,319
So our new intersectional community phenomena could be sharing of material goods.

650
01:07:47,320 --> 01:07:56,500
So you could have like a co-op could be a community of shareholders within a particular corporation or things like that.

651
01:07:56,860 --> 01:08:01,600
Common interests. We talked about some of the challenge around the term Mallrats.

652
01:08:02,920 --> 01:08:09,670
I don't know if that term is even use anymore. You know what a mallrat is is a small rodent who lives at a mall,

653
01:08:10,030 --> 01:08:19,290
but people who hang out in the mall like, you know, usually teenagers look like that.

654
01:08:20,130 --> 01:08:24,430
Is that right? Or just have a different meaning. Yeah.

655
01:08:25,870 --> 01:08:30,669
So I guess going off of what I was saying, ignorance.

656
01:08:30,670 --> 01:08:36,100
So could ignorance be a dimension of community like in the opposite?

657
01:08:36,720 --> 01:08:43,080
Yeah. Where it creates this community that's so out of touch with what is critically conscious.

658
01:08:43,440 --> 01:08:56,159
Conscious like, for example, like what comes to mind is how a lot of times and I don't want to say like pop culture or like in common lingo,

659
01:08:56,160 --> 01:08:59,969
people use the term when they're super overwhelmed or stressed.

660
01:08:59,970 --> 01:09:02,730
They say, I'm going to kill myself, or stuff like that,

661
01:09:02,730 --> 01:09:09,780
which is very out of touch with people that maybe have a connection with suicidality or mental health.

662
01:09:10,170 --> 01:09:17,700
But like, can that can that ignorance create or like create this community that enforces

663
01:09:18,210 --> 01:09:25,170
that and had an immediate sassy response was I withhold such a lesson desires.

664
01:09:25,590 --> 01:09:34,499
Right. That's that's a people who hold a shared negative belief are people who believe that January six didn't happen, you know.

665
01:09:34,500 --> 01:09:35,760
So yeah, I think that's a really good point,

666
01:09:35,760 --> 01:09:42,030
is that you can and unfortunately what social media has done is it made it easier for people to connect, right?

667
01:09:42,360 --> 01:09:50,370
So if we didn't have social media and you had a couple of, you know, just different people who had believes that,

668
01:09:50,370 --> 01:09:59,440
you know, the Bible didn't win, believe that January six was just a visit to the Capital Church.

669
01:09:59,910 --> 01:10:10,110
They probably would not find each other. But, you know, social media has created the ability to create communities that are around that ignorance.

670
01:10:10,170 --> 01:10:16,380
Yeah, I think a good word for it could be like cyclical reinforcement learning, like beliefs.

671
01:10:16,470 --> 01:10:19,730
Oh, yeah, exactly. Yeah, that's true. Because they just feed on each other. Right.

672
01:10:19,740 --> 01:10:23,430
So it's like, yeah, conspiracy theorists around different things.

673
01:10:23,430 --> 01:10:33,330
Like, I love a good conspiracy theory when it's a good one remains a good one, but not as good as other people.

674
01:10:33,720 --> 01:10:42,960
Yeah, it does. Yeah. I think that's a good point to bring up, especially like around Elon Musk's purchase of Twitter.

675
01:10:43,080 --> 01:10:50,670
Yeah, because content moderation on social media is pretty important for like not letting like another January 6th happen.

676
01:10:50,700 --> 01:10:57,420
Yeah. And Elon Musk is seemingly like doing away with a lot of the content moderation that Twitter was doing.

677
01:10:57,450 --> 01:11:05,309
Yeah, I think like he recently announced that like on Twitter, like, like famous people are like verified.

678
01:11:05,310 --> 01:11:15,150
Right? So he said like his new policy is that you can just pay $8 per month to be verified, which I think will have two impacts.

679
01:11:15,150 --> 01:11:21,170
I think, one, a lot of people wouldn't want to pay that. So a lot of people who like probably should be verified, maybe won't be anymore.

680
01:11:22,170 --> 01:11:25,520
And then to like people who like probably shouldn't be verified and like maybe

681
01:11:25,830 --> 01:11:29,880
becoming verified now and like verification is pretty important for like,

682
01:11:30,210 --> 01:11:37,050
like when I, when I see something from a verified account, I usually trust it a lot more than like a non verified account for example.

683
01:11:37,230 --> 01:11:45,090
Yeah. And so I think like my fear for like this new policy is that a lot of like fake accounts are going to become

684
01:11:45,090 --> 01:11:50,399
verified now that like shouldn't be in like there's gonna be a lot more misinformation on a site already,

685
01:11:50,400 --> 01:11:57,930
like rampant. Right? Yeah. Yeah. I think everyone should just make a commitment and throw Twitter away.

686
01:11:58,980 --> 01:12:09,060
I did see a political strategist once that talked about one of the best ways to fight a lot of this negative right or rhetoric is for all the rich,

687
01:12:10,650 --> 01:12:17,340
more progressive people to get together. And then by Twitter, Elon Musk.

688
01:12:17,400 --> 01:12:20,140
And I just think that's exactly so.

689
01:12:20,460 --> 01:12:27,600
Yeah, it is scary because, you know, I mean, that's actually what you brought up about misinformation are disinformation communities forming.

690
01:12:27,900 --> 01:12:31,379
And then this just like fuels the fire, the negative?

691
01:12:31,380 --> 01:12:36,720
I don't know. Yeah, I was I was going to say also like like Twitter was at least like trying,

692
01:12:36,720 --> 01:12:40,860
but like Facebook was just like it's like it's the Wild West out there.

693
01:12:40,860 --> 01:12:46,409
Like, it's all about the money. I mean, it's like, dude has a bajillion dollars.

694
01:12:46,410 --> 01:12:50,549
Does he really need anymore? I mean, it's like we're just losing money on this.

695
01:12:50,550 --> 01:12:54,220
When he bought Twitter, he bought it for way more than it was worth. Yeah.

696
01:12:54,310 --> 01:13:00,250
Yeah, good. Because. Well, but Elon Musk was like to be like I started on the site.

697
01:13:00,360 --> 01:13:04,680
We don't really talk about that.

698
01:13:05,010 --> 01:13:08,340
You know, we'll talk about capacity sharing next class.

699
01:13:08,820 --> 01:13:11,670
So this is a great class. I really enjoyed hearing your perspective.

700
01:13:11,670 --> 01:13:23,430
The viewpoints holding was interesting to you and have a great weekend and we will see what you think really striking in the room.

701
01:13:23,430 --> 01:13:34,700
You haven't been able to find out your options for, you know.

702
01:13:36,190 --> 01:13:39,720
I was never an invalid. Oh, you're right. Yes.

703
01:13:39,730 --> 01:13:45,700
I'm sorry. Class was canceled on Tuesday, so you don't have to go back on Tuesday.

704
01:13:46,060 --> 01:13:51,150
Make sure your vote makes you drag ten friends your home and a visit to the bar.

705
01:13:54,410 --> 01:13:58,490
Going anywhere? No, no, no.

706
01:14:00,370 --> 01:14:08,360
By the way, I like you.

707
01:14:10,830 --> 01:14:17,270
I don't know who I'm going.
