1
00:00:00,450 --> 00:00:04,589
I don't know why, he said.

2
00:00:04,590 --> 00:00:08,240
It's like crazy. We're doing this stuff.

3
00:00:08,250 --> 00:00:18,930
We could do it. We were supposed to because they said, Oh, you seem like you've never done anything like this.

4
00:00:19,380 --> 00:00:26,010
I don't think there's anything I can do on the 30th of an off all day,

5
00:00:27,870 --> 00:00:33,890
because the only other time that we were on Saturday night and I was just like, Oh, we're not waiting until it's done.

6
00:00:34,110 --> 00:00:51,330
That's the first one. I wanted it to be Sunday night, and I said, I him if you want us to start.

7
00:00:52,770 --> 00:01:02,730
Okay. But yeah, I heard that through Sunday so and so I just opened availability on Sunday.

8
00:01:03,940 --> 00:01:10,730
So anything.

9
00:01:10,890 --> 00:01:41,720
Okay, so it's sections of doing that, which is not something that I just had to go through to make sure it's something that's five,

10
00:01:41,730 --> 00:01:51,290
10 minutes when there's something on in the upper and lower left and right.

11
00:01:51,440 --> 00:02:23,090
Yeah, I think it's also hard to make compromises in that respect, I guess, but it's a very common experience and it doesn't hurt my enthusiasm for me.

12
00:02:23,100 --> 00:02:31,550
And, you know, I just I didn't do it.

13
00:02:32,010 --> 00:02:46,100
I just emailed them as I was on Sunday three and I just literally added all that they had gotten and ever working with a massive,

14
00:02:46,860 --> 00:02:58,620
quite conservative sample there and trying to just pretend that it's going to be okay.

15
00:02:59,070 --> 00:03:04,139
Short announcements, announcements this morning.

16
00:03:04,140 --> 00:03:12,900
So we're going to go over six. I gave the exams the greater on Friday and he promises to have them done at the end of this week.

17
00:03:14,010 --> 00:03:26,129
And then from the reading there's quite a bit of interest in like the effects of liposuction and school coolsculpting on metabolic health.

18
00:03:26,130 --> 00:03:28,890
And I'll talk about that on Wednesday.

19
00:03:29,790 --> 00:03:41,639
I'd like to find it very briefly, six or seven studies on my perception and what effect it had systemically coolsculpting.

20
00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:47,160
I found it at one time to look percent one for Little Rock about that on Wednesday.

21
00:03:49,770 --> 00:03:53,339
So quit six months that you got there.

22
00:03:53,340 --> 00:03:57,239
All of them, right. Or at least two out of three. And it's a difficult one.

23
00:03:57,240 --> 00:04:06,389
People have seemed to have this question. So the question asks a person who has elevated outward tissue perception resistance.

24
00:04:06,390 --> 00:04:08,520
This is the case for this particular individual.

25
00:04:09,210 --> 00:04:18,840
All of the following treatments could overcome left and resistance, except the correct answer was an injection of physiologic dose of leptin.

26
00:04:20,010 --> 00:04:30,060
And so with a physiologic dose of leptin, it's the leptin that would be at the same level circulating in your blood, right?

27
00:04:30,870 --> 00:04:35,610
In order to overcome leptin resistance, you'd have to give them a super physiologic dose.

28
00:04:36,730 --> 00:04:46,709
And that's what you would need. Yeah. So although there's already circulating in this individual, any additional leptin wouldn't be enough.

29
00:04:46,710 --> 00:04:50,490
You'd have to have a super amount. Yes, you have to have a lot more.

30
00:04:50,500 --> 00:04:57,250
Yeah. So the initial trials in the nineties where they tried to get people this is an Amgen study.

31
00:04:57,490 --> 00:05:03,730
They tried to get people injections of leptin to reduce their body weight and it didn't work.

32
00:05:03,970 --> 00:05:08,560
And this is where the principle of electrical is started to come about.

33
00:05:09,430 --> 00:05:15,819
So said Milana time, this is the year for agonists that would shut down appetite.

34
00:05:15,820 --> 00:05:26,020
That would work if you had a way of knocking down these mediators that contribute to leptin receptor resistance,

35
00:05:27,130 --> 00:05:29,770
receptor dysfunction, I should say you would overcome it.

36
00:05:30,280 --> 00:05:40,389
And then if you had a way of reducing total adiposity that would lower leptin and that would make your unit more

37
00:05:40,390 --> 00:05:48,820
responsive to circulating prevalence of leptin because it would release the brake on the left resistance in the brain.

38
00:05:53,970 --> 00:05:58,870
The other questions, everybody got lots to write for the most part.

39
00:05:59,320 --> 00:06:03,280
Why? Why? This is that gut hormone that regulates appetite and satiety.

40
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:07,000
How do you why why levels compared to mean versus those with obesity?

41
00:06:08,620 --> 00:06:17,130
So the correct answer here was p p well, levels are start up low at baseline and after feeding after a meal process postprandial,

42
00:06:17,300 --> 00:06:22,450
they are still lower than individuals who have a lower body mass index.

43
00:06:26,890 --> 00:06:31,750
And then finally, this is actually a question number three.

44
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:37,210
A significant flaw in the set point theory of body weight regulation is that

45
00:06:38,050 --> 00:06:42,730
it doesn't consider the environmental influences on body weight homeostasis.

46
00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:48,130
So this is the one based on Kennedy's studies in the Rat.

47
00:06:48,670 --> 00:06:57,220
And then there was some more talk about the set point theory model when leptin was discovered.

48
00:06:57,490 --> 00:07:13,210
And it turns out that it's not the best model system that describes human physiology, that the other examples are not the set point theory and.

49
00:07:16,010 --> 00:07:20,570
The first one would include environmental and intrinsic influences.

50
00:07:22,100 --> 00:07:26,210
That said point there doesn't consider environmental influences.

51
00:07:26,570 --> 00:07:30,170
And finally, this is the the settling point model.

52
00:07:30,620 --> 00:07:35,070
This last one describes a settling point in months. Okay.

53
00:07:35,100 --> 00:07:40,970
Any questions about quiz number six? Took that away.

54
00:07:51,260 --> 00:07:57,660
We're talking about adipose tissue. Would you? It got us to this.

55
00:08:04,100 --> 00:08:11,399
Okay. So we were talking the last time that we met right before the exam,

56
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:22,469
we were talking about this particular concept where you have somebody who is treated with a drug that the pipeline isn't that class of drugs.

57
00:08:22,470 --> 00:08:25,860
That is an activator of P part Gamma.

58
00:08:25,860 --> 00:08:32,749
And you read a little bit about that and from the reading. And what this does is it promotes a type of genesis.

59
00:08:32,750 --> 00:08:38,880
So you get a lot more adipocytes, a larger number of adipocytes.

60
00:08:39,840 --> 00:08:46,649
And as a consequence of this treatment, this individual is on the treatment.

61
00:08:46,650 --> 00:08:53,610
Here is their the area of their adipose tissue depots and subcutaneous compartment and the visceral compartment.

62
00:08:54,960 --> 00:09:01,780
And the subcutaneous compartment increases and the visceral compartment decreases.

63
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:09,510
Based on these measurements from the CT scan and their fasting blood glucose improves,

64
00:09:10,550 --> 00:09:18,510
it goes down from 184 where their hemoglobin A1 C goes down, improving their metabolic status.

65
00:09:19,140 --> 00:09:33,480
So the P PA gamma agonist improved metabolic function by improving from this these results an increase in the adipocyte hyperplasia.

66
00:09:34,470 --> 00:09:37,170
So this is a functional improvement.

67
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:45,930
And one of the things that I want to emphasize that it's the function of adipose tissue that matters more than anything else.

68
00:09:47,070 --> 00:09:56,730
It's their ability to take up lipid and prevent it from being deposited topically in muscle or liver and other organs.

69
00:09:57,660 --> 00:10:01,560
And if you can do that, you can preserve metabolic function.

70
00:10:01,970 --> 00:10:12,690
One way to do that is through hyperplasia increased number of small adipocytes, and that's what was demonstrated in this particular paper.

71
00:10:21,090 --> 00:10:28,500
So the other point I want to make that these adipose tissue, adipose tissue is good.

72
00:10:29,190 --> 00:10:39,150
You need adipocytes to perform their function as a way to sequester lipids, to store that energy for us, a long term energy source.

73
00:10:39,660 --> 00:10:46,200
And as an endocrine plant, you talk a bit more about that with my lecture number 13.

74
00:10:47,350 --> 00:10:55,600
The next set of slides focuses on what happens if you can't make a difference.

75
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:59,770
Actually, you don't have or you have very few adipocytes what is active in that?

76
00:11:05,530 --> 00:11:14,560
So we know that adipose tissue prevents the spillover of trials with glycerol three fatty acids and lipid storage.

77
00:11:14,860 --> 00:11:21,520
So this is pertaining just to the ability of adipose tissue now to take up those lipids and prevent them from spilling over.

78
00:11:22,540 --> 00:11:30,790
The model system was created to examine this function and the model system is the aids of mouse.

79
00:11:31,630 --> 00:11:37,480
This is a fat loss animal. It can produce very little white adipose tissue.

80
00:11:38,590 --> 00:11:45,520
And these mice have diabetes, they have insulin resistance, they have dyslipidemia,

81
00:11:45,940 --> 00:11:49,840
and the lipids end up in other tissues and organs, as you you'll see.

82
00:11:51,370 --> 00:12:01,330
And one of the things that they did to test this idea that white tissue as if it's functional,

83
00:12:01,930 --> 00:12:09,700
it has favorable effects on metabolism of the implanted white adipose tissue in these fabulous mice.

84
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:13,870
It should improve metabolic function and we'll see how those results turned out.

85
00:12:16,540 --> 00:12:28,120
So these mice have been euthanized and they removed their skin to show you the differences in adipose tissue in the subcutaneous compartments.

86
00:12:29,560 --> 00:12:43,330
So the animal on the left is the control and it has the appearance of white adipose tissue in the upper portion of its of its back lower portion.

87
00:12:43,330 --> 00:12:49,510
And you can kind of see some subcutaneous adipose tissue, whereas in the eyes at fat loss mice,

88
00:12:50,350 --> 00:12:54,129
they're very lean and you don't see any white appearance here.

89
00:12:54,130 --> 00:12:58,210
So there's no adipose tissue or very little in this particular animal.

90
00:13:01,490 --> 00:13:05,680
As a consequence of that, there's significant metabolic disturbances.

91
00:13:07,900 --> 00:13:16,930
So notice in the graph, it gives you different metabolic parameters as the very first one as being glucose.

92
00:13:17,500 --> 00:13:27,610
And the different bars mean that you have both male and female mice and this is glucose in milligrams per deciliter.

93
00:13:27,820 --> 00:13:35,710
And you can see that. And the ace of mice right here on the on the on the right hand side there,

94
00:13:35,860 --> 00:13:40,720
blood glucose levels for both male and females are much, much higher than the wild animals.

95
00:13:41,950 --> 00:13:48,730
All that they did was transgenic leads prevented the development of why not?

96
00:13:49,390 --> 00:13:55,840
Even insulin levels are also really high.

97
00:13:56,200 --> 00:13:58,690
Responding to that higher elevation in glucose.

98
00:13:59,980 --> 00:14:06,490
Triglyceride levels are high and they're not significantly, but they had a tendency to be higher than females then in the males.

99
00:14:08,140 --> 00:14:11,320
Fatty acids were higher in both groups of animals,

100
00:14:11,740 --> 00:14:18,819
and one of the things that they looked at was ketosis and a marker for because this was this ADA

101
00:14:18,820 --> 00:14:24,610
hydroxybutyrate and they didn't find differences in the ketosis between these two different animals.

102
00:14:25,720 --> 00:14:34,690
So in the mice you have elevated glucose, you have elevated insulin, you have elevated blood lipids.

103
00:14:39,520 --> 00:14:51,970
So taking a closer look at the tissues from the control and the fat, less mice and it's a very top portion is a cross section of the skin.

104
00:14:52,450 --> 00:14:58,570
So here's the wild type control. And to the right, here is the age of the fat, less mice.

105
00:14:59,260 --> 00:15:05,530
And if you look underneath a layer of skin here in the wild type, you see this layer of adipose tissue right here.

106
00:15:07,800 --> 00:15:17,670
Well, in the case of mice, you might see a couple of different differences, but it's pretty much the very first tissue.

107
00:15:18,270 --> 00:15:27,030
And that's the second portion that's been portion of this figure is the liver.

108
00:15:27,570 --> 00:15:31,500
So here is what looks like a healthy liver in a wild type animal.

109
00:15:31,740 --> 00:15:41,670
It has this reddish brownish color. Notice the size of this organ compared to the liver from the fat, less mouse.

110
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:45,180
It's bigger and it's paler in color.

111
00:15:46,590 --> 00:15:56,820
And that's because the lipids that are normally sequestered and stored safely in the adipose tissue are being stored topically in the liver.

112
00:15:58,050 --> 00:16:05,970
If you were to take the next portion of that figure shows you a cross-section of the liver.

113
00:16:05,970 --> 00:16:13,590
So here's the controls and here's the phase months where you see these expanded airspace.

114
00:16:13,590 --> 00:16:16,380
They're not airspaces. They're actually lipid spaces within the liver.

115
00:16:17,910 --> 00:16:28,200
So the paleness of the liver is due to the ectopic storage of triglycerides within the liver itself.

116
00:16:29,070 --> 00:16:32,990
And this leads to metabolic disturbances. This is essentially fatty liver disease.

117
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:42,480
What you're seeing here is the final portion of this particular figure.

118
00:16:42,590 --> 00:16:48,980
DB You have the pancreas and you can see the expansion of the islands.

119
00:16:49,980 --> 00:16:57,060
So here in a lighter color is an island within the pancreas.

120
00:16:58,500 --> 00:17:02,170
Over here on the right is the islet in the back.

121
00:17:02,670 --> 00:17:08,730
There's huge there, much bigger than what we saw in the wild type animal.

122
00:17:08,850 --> 00:17:12,270
And that's because the glucose levels are so much higher.

123
00:17:13,060 --> 00:17:21,990
And in response to that, the beta cells expand and increase in number and size to produce more insulin.

124
00:17:22,650 --> 00:17:30,060
And we get these massive cells within the pancreas increasing size.

125
00:17:36,510 --> 00:17:41,310
So this is at 22 weeks of age and this is just on a regular chow diet.

126
00:17:45,150 --> 00:17:57,990
So if that's true, if if you get metabolic disturbances in the absence of adipose tissue, then you should be able to rescue this defect in metabolism.

127
00:17:58,470 --> 00:18:03,520
Glucose and triglycerides and insulin and products.

128
00:18:03,540 --> 00:18:09,030
That tells us by giving these fat loss mice some adipose tissue.

129
00:18:09,720 --> 00:18:12,930
And that's what they did in this next set of experiments.

130
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:17,580
So they did this adipose tissue transplants,

131
00:18:18,150 --> 00:18:28,170
and this is underneath the surface of the skin of one of the mice that is given an adipose tissue transplant.

132
00:18:29,430 --> 00:18:33,120
And as you can see, there's connections to blood vessels.

133
00:18:33,930 --> 00:18:37,319
And they took a section of this, a cross-section of this.

134
00:18:37,320 --> 00:18:43,950
And this is the adipose tissue now shown under magnification.

135
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:53,910
And we see now a nerve and the vasculature, so that this adipose tissue is supplied with nerves and vasculature.

136
00:18:53,910 --> 00:18:57,730
So it's living tissue. After the transplant.

137
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:03,549
In the last portion, the C portion, these are euthanized mice.

138
00:19:03,550 --> 00:19:10,840
And we're looking at here is that mouse that didn't receive the transplant and the mouse that didn't receive the transplant.

139
00:19:11,320 --> 00:19:17,760
So there are six transplanted adipose tissue here in adipose tissue, 1 to 3.

140
00:19:18,110 --> 00:19:28,610
It's hard to see this. One, four, five, six. And note that there's a little bit of a difference in the size of the abdomen in these animals.

141
00:19:29,480 --> 00:19:33,110
And that size is due to the size of the liver.

142
00:19:34,130 --> 00:19:39,200
So the liver in this that less mouse would be expanded.

143
00:19:39,560 --> 00:19:53,000
And because it's taking up the triglycerides that are normally stored, the tissue and transplant of adipose tissue or that ability to take up liver.

144
00:19:54,890 --> 00:20:05,870
So this is three weeks after the transplantation shown here and the graph appears yellow, kind of whitish.

145
00:20:08,870 --> 00:20:12,530
So here's some more details about this.

146
00:20:12,830 --> 00:20:16,700
You probably see this on your screens without the animation effects.

147
00:20:17,900 --> 00:20:22,340
And so this is therapeutics after the transplantation.

148
00:20:23,930 --> 00:20:28,280
We're looking at a successful way to transplant tissue.

149
00:20:28,340 --> 00:20:33,710
The tissue is accepted by the animal. And it functions normally as adipose tissue would.

150
00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:42,640
Yeah. So the mouse on the right receives the transplant and did not.

151
00:20:43,010 --> 00:20:59,300
They're both fabulous mice. So the next set of figures, we look at the metabolic status of these cells.

152
00:21:00,500 --> 00:21:11,640
So on the very top, you have glucose and the grade indicates the levels at six weeks after transplantation.

153
00:21:11,660 --> 00:21:16,670
So this is the range at which you would see in normal life.

154
00:21:16,740 --> 00:21:22,610
This is this is still quite high, 250 milligrams per deciliter.

155
00:21:23,300 --> 00:21:28,790
So you're starting out here at the same level. You're starting off here at the same level.

156
00:21:28,790 --> 00:21:31,820
And after transplantation, six weeks after transplantation,

157
00:21:32,420 --> 00:21:40,580
the animals that have gotten the fat transplant down here decreased, the glucose levels decrease.

158
00:21:41,480 --> 00:21:52,100
But in the animals that were just served as a control, we do what is known as a sham surgery where they perform the surgery,

159
00:21:52,220 --> 00:21:57,830
but they didn't give them adipose tissue just to mimic the effects of the stress of the surgery.

160
00:21:58,700 --> 00:22:08,389
And so without the addition of the fat pads, their blood glucose continues to increase and insulin levels follow.

161
00:22:08,390 --> 00:22:15,830
A similar pattern here as the sham hears their transplanted insulin levels continue to reach higher.

162
00:22:16,160 --> 00:22:25,430
And fatness mice once that transplant insulin down and then the weight of the animals

163
00:22:25,430 --> 00:22:33,530
changes a bit to sort of wait here in the dark or the filled circles is the GM animals,

164
00:22:33,530 --> 00:22:44,899
the fat loss GM animal and the ones with the open samples that received the transplants so that the weight gain here is probably due,

165
00:22:44,900 --> 00:22:49,310
most likely due to the lipid levels in the liver.

166
00:22:49,410 --> 00:23:01,370
You see, the expanded size of the liver is taking up the excess triglycerides in the animals that are receiving the transplants.

167
00:23:01,610 --> 00:23:04,910
It's the transplanted adipose tissue that's taking up the checklist.

168
00:23:06,470 --> 00:23:09,770
And there are lots of other things going on.

169
00:23:10,220 --> 00:23:21,170
The transplanted animal has on its face it has thermal insulin levels, and that's going to affect things related to these differences in type.

170
00:23:26,420 --> 00:23:36,770
So taking a close look at the livers after the transplant, these are letters both from the phallus mice, the one on the left.

171
00:23:36,770 --> 00:23:43,790
Is that the sham for the control? The one on the right is the one that's received at most tissue transplants.

172
00:23:44,330 --> 00:23:51,920
And here in these open areas where you have the white appearance, these are lipid droplets within the liver.

173
00:23:53,180 --> 00:23:58,580
This is steatosis this is the hepatic uptake of lipid.

174
00:23:59,810 --> 00:24:07,250
And then on the right side here, this is the healthy liver from the animals that have received the adipose tissue transplant.

175
00:24:11,390 --> 00:24:16,550
There is virtually no very little glycerol is being stored in the liver here.

176
00:24:19,700 --> 00:24:24,530
This next set of figures looks at insulin responsiveness.

177
00:24:26,120 --> 00:24:30,560
For glucose and insulin responses. The first one is 8 minutes after glucose injection.

178
00:24:30,570 --> 00:24:35,990
So you're looking at how well they can handle glucose load.

179
00:24:37,550 --> 00:24:41,390
So that's dark in circles. This is the wild type animal.

180
00:24:41,930 --> 00:24:51,230
The open circles are the animals that were the use of animals that did not receive the transplant because levels go up and elevated.

181
00:24:53,270 --> 00:25:00,320
And then the ones that have received the transplant, they are all in the same line that you see for the wild type animal.

182
00:25:03,230 --> 00:25:10,100
This is minutes after insulin injection on the portion of this diagram and this is

183
00:25:10,100 --> 00:25:15,709
glucose percent of initial with the wild type animals shown in the darker circles,

184
00:25:15,710 --> 00:25:18,830
it goes down significantly different from the sham.

185
00:25:18,830 --> 00:25:23,510
After about 30 minutes in the transplanted animals, they actually do better.

186
00:25:23,510 --> 00:25:31,310
They're able to clear that glucose after this insulin injection compared with both of the other treatments.

187
00:25:37,700 --> 00:25:41,690
Next, we're looking at tissue to DG uptake.

188
00:25:42,560 --> 00:25:50,660
So this is the ability of the muscle to take up glucose in these different groups.

189
00:25:51,650 --> 00:25:55,790
So these are the black bars here in this panel. So you have wild type sham and transplant.

190
00:25:56,810 --> 00:26:03,340
So notice the difference between the Wildcats and the chairman of transplant in these sham animals

191
00:26:03,740 --> 00:26:09,950
that just mice that did not receive the transplant is not able to take up as much of this two.

192
00:26:09,950 --> 00:26:22,070
DG Compared to the others, 2 to 2 Deoxy glucose is a molecule that can bind to the glucose transporter within the muscle.

193
00:26:23,300 --> 00:26:29,540
And it gets inside the muscle and it's trapped there and it releases that radioactivity.

194
00:26:29,990 --> 00:26:33,680
So it's a method that you can use to measure glucose uptake.

195
00:26:35,720 --> 00:26:43,250
So glucose uptake is restored or it's actually improved statistically in the transplanted hand.

196
00:26:45,320 --> 00:26:51,290
In terms of uptake in the fat, there's really no difference between the wild type and the transplant.

197
00:26:52,680 --> 00:26:56,780
You're not not shown.

198
00:26:57,410 --> 00:27:08,750
There's no fat in the animal. And then finally you're looking at basal and insulin mediated uptake of this two DG,

199
00:27:09,380 --> 00:27:21,080
just black bars indicating the level at baseline and then the open bars indicate what happens after you give them insulin.

200
00:27:21,950 --> 00:27:30,680
So after insulin that the animals, the wild type and the trans animal transplant animal are able to respond to that insulin.

201
00:27:30,920 --> 00:27:44,180
So they're more insulin sensitive, whereas the sham animal, they have significantly less ability to respond to that insulin taking up that two.

202
00:27:44,180 --> 00:28:00,840
DG Which are taking up glucose. So to summarize, the experiments that I just showed you, where you had a lack of of adipose tissue,

203
00:28:00,990 --> 00:28:06,570
and in humans there is a condition called lack of dystrophy.

204
00:28:07,140 --> 00:28:14,430
It can either be a whole body life or dystrophy, or it can be a regional or a partial dystrophy.

205
00:28:15,800 --> 00:28:20,600
And the human example has the same kind of issues.

206
00:28:21,290 --> 00:28:31,550
They get fatty liver disease, they get diabetes or insulin resistant because they don't have enough functional adipose tissue.

207
00:28:33,860 --> 00:28:39,710
So the lack of adipose tissue in dystrophin leads to elevated serum and liver, triglycerides,

208
00:28:41,660 --> 00:28:46,790
elevations in blood glucose, insulin, insulin resistance and impaired uptake.

209
00:28:48,770 --> 00:29:00,050
And when we restore the ability of the animals to take up excess lipids, the transplant, it reduces both sugar and liver.

210
00:29:00,110 --> 00:29:07,220
Triglycerides, it reduces blood glucose and insulin, improves muscle glucose uptake,

211
00:29:08,240 --> 00:29:14,480
and nearly restores all metabolic functions compared to the wild type.

212
00:29:16,370 --> 00:29:21,890
So you need to have functional adipose tissue or glucose homeostasis.

213
00:29:23,960 --> 00:29:38,270
If you have an impaired ability to store excess lipids or lipids, even after a meal, it can contribute to problems with glucose homeostasis.

214
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:42,890
So it's the function of adipose tissue that's really important here.

215
00:29:44,150 --> 00:29:51,950
You can have a person going back to the bathtub analogy, the person with the smaller bathtub.

216
00:29:52,170 --> 00:29:59,840
It would represent somebody who has less adipose tissue, but more importantly, somebody who has less adipose tissue function.

217
00:30:01,220 --> 00:30:04,400
It's a function that matters more than anything else.

218
00:30:04,850 --> 00:30:15,520
And adipose tissue can expand and take up that excess lipid dominant in the form of the hips like hyperplasia and stem.

219
00:30:17,060 --> 00:30:23,240
Better outcomes in terms of their glucose homeostasis and metabolic parameters.

220
00:30:27,110 --> 00:30:33,440
Okay. So next year I'm going to talk about brown adipose tissue.

221
00:30:34,550 --> 00:30:40,310
And I would say during the past 15 or 20 years, there's been a lot of excitement about Brown out,

222
00:30:40,310 --> 00:30:49,700
of course, tissue, which was assumed to be mostly important at hibernating animals and neonates.

223
00:30:51,110 --> 00:30:54,170
But it turns out it's important in adults as well.

224
00:30:55,670 --> 00:31:05,540
So this is an illustration at the very top, looking at the different types or the major kinds of adipocytes, light beige and brown.

225
00:31:07,040 --> 00:31:13,790
And you're looking at in these columns the expression of uncoupling, protein, water.

226
00:31:13,790 --> 00:31:22,270
You see p one. Mitochondrial density, a bit droplet size and then primary functions.

227
00:31:22,990 --> 00:31:28,750
So comparing the white adipose tissue to the beige and brown adipose tissue,

228
00:31:30,130 --> 00:31:35,710
you have the most uncoupling protein expression in brown adipose tissue compared to the others.

229
00:31:36,340 --> 00:31:40,660
And exactly what that does I'll talk about in the next couple of slides.

230
00:31:42,280 --> 00:31:47,860
Mitochondrial, there's quite a bit of difference in mitochondrial density between these different types of adipocytes.

231
00:31:48,730 --> 00:31:58,059
The least concentration of mitochondria you'll find in the white adipose tissue are quite a little bit more

232
00:31:58,060 --> 00:32:05,140
in the in the beige adipocytes in a very high level of mitochondria present in the brown within the site.

233
00:32:06,610 --> 00:32:13,060
And then the other difference that's very clear in this illustration has to do with the lipid droplets.

234
00:32:13,570 --> 00:32:18,220
You just have one giant lipid droplet, one vacuole within the white site,

235
00:32:19,090 --> 00:32:28,180
within the base of the adipocyte, you have your lipid droplets and then the brown adipocytes.

236
00:32:28,180 --> 00:32:35,860
You have many multiple ocular deficits within this particular cell.

237
00:32:37,570 --> 00:32:47,350
And then the primary functions you have energy storage and endocrine function for the white adipose tissue for base,

238
00:32:47,350 --> 00:32:49,900
you have thermogenesis and some endocrine function.

239
00:32:50,350 --> 00:32:58,480
And then for brown adipose tissue you have thermogenesis being the primary distinction between brown and white adipose tissue.

240
00:33:00,790 --> 00:33:08,560
And that it can release some hormones as well, which are we're just beginning to understand them.

241
00:33:08,680 --> 00:33:15,280
And this type of work has been done probably in the past 5 to 10 years,

242
00:33:17,020 --> 00:33:24,550
looking at the location of these adipose tissue depots between an infant, a rodent and a human.

243
00:33:25,480 --> 00:33:32,469
You'll find some similarities. But in terms of the levels of brown adipose tissue in humans,

244
00:33:32,470 --> 00:33:40,860
you'll see more in an infant showing in the different locations here in the next x Larry locations.

245
00:33:41,530 --> 00:33:53,640
Your scapula human vertebral and renal here in the infant and the rodent the as in

246
00:33:53,650 --> 00:33:57,910
the site the brown and at the sites are little bit scattered throughout the animal.

247
00:33:58,480 --> 00:34:07,810
You had a question so a few years ago, I know that they were doing research on brown adipose tissue and I can't remember like what diabetes,

248
00:34:09,070 --> 00:34:14,049
but I don't know if that has been like what if we replace the white adipose tissue with

249
00:34:14,050 --> 00:34:24,310
brown adipose tissue and those with diabetes that change the change that I don't know.

250
00:34:24,400 --> 00:34:30,730
It's possible right now. I'll touch on that here in a minute, but that's a possibility.

251
00:34:31,720 --> 00:34:38,950
I don't know if that's been done in animal models, but a way to do that instead of doing a transplant,

252
00:34:38,950 --> 00:34:45,460
which is really invasive, is to give treatments that increase the activity of the brown tissue.

253
00:34:45,850 --> 00:34:55,060
That's a really good question that you have. So if there's a way to increase its activity and there's two different methods to do that.

254
00:34:55,090 --> 00:34:57,560
There's two. We'll talk about that in a minute.

255
00:34:57,580 --> 00:35:09,730
There's a way to increase its activity by giving a drug that activates catecholamine receptors that would do it and exposure to cold,

256
00:35:10,450 --> 00:35:15,190
not to you would be exposed to cruel temperatures, let's say,

257
00:35:15,880 --> 00:35:21,250
to the point where it would be enough to make you feel cold, but it wouldn't be enough to make you shiver.

258
00:35:23,240 --> 00:35:30,860
And the other way if that's thought to activate or increase brown adipose tissue activity is exercise.

259
00:35:32,250 --> 00:35:38,100
So those are three things that have been proposed as a way to improve metabolic function.

260
00:35:40,400 --> 00:35:46,459
So the location shown here in the adult, the same as the infant,

261
00:35:46,460 --> 00:35:56,780
but a little bit smaller that that's the positioning of these location of these cervical sub scapula axillary carrier aortic.

262
00:35:57,320 --> 00:36:02,990
So the adipose tissue, the brown adipose tissue is scattered throughout the upper thorax.

263
00:36:03,470 --> 00:36:07,880
It's also part of their chief role here and then very renal.

264
00:36:09,050 --> 00:36:18,230
So it's going to be located in areas around major blood vessels and it performs this function of thermogenesis.

265
00:36:18,830 --> 00:36:24,920
It's not a position that can have the greatest effect on increasing body temperature.

266
00:36:27,380 --> 00:36:32,390
So those are the locations, those are the major functions. And unfortunately,

267
00:36:32,390 --> 00:36:41,070
it seems like on the long term this is not that efficient due to adaptive single does have increased energy expenditure as a long term,

268
00:36:41,090 --> 00:36:46,190
it's going to increase energy intakes, economic benefit from them.

269
00:36:47,450 --> 00:36:59,360
Yeah, potentially. Potentially, yeah. In terms of strategies to increase brown adipose activity, if it looks I haven't seen.

270
00:37:00,670 --> 00:37:07,030
Literature that examines the long term effects of terms of energy intake on that strategy.

271
00:37:07,030 --> 00:37:10,269
But that's a good point. You're increasing energy expenditure.

272
00:37:10,270 --> 00:37:17,440
You may also be increasing hunger. Now, what kind of benefit of that type of an approach?

273
00:37:17,530 --> 00:37:25,450
Yeah. So those living in conditions that were like a lot of solar, it's typically cold for long periods of time.

274
00:37:25,450 --> 00:37:32,769
They have wood, they have higher brown adipose tissue activity than we would.

275
00:37:32,770 --> 00:37:36,819
And it goes from brown it but it can go back to white, right?

276
00:37:36,820 --> 00:37:42,879
Or does it go to beige? So I'll show you some examples of this in the subsequent slides.

277
00:37:42,880 --> 00:37:49,750
But what has been measured is the activity of the adipose tissue rather than the mass,

278
00:37:49,750 --> 00:37:57,250
because the relatively small and they're located in regions that are kind of hard to measure in in an adult human mice,

279
00:37:57,250 --> 00:38:04,960
you can actually take these things out and measure them. But in a human, it's not so much it's hard to measure them even with a CT scan.

280
00:38:06,820 --> 00:38:13,030
So just to go over again, here's brown adipose tissue here, said Hematoxylin and isn't stained.

281
00:38:14,410 --> 00:38:19,480
It looks very different from the inside cross-sections that I've shown you.

282
00:38:21,610 --> 00:38:31,489
Here's a summary of its locations. Neck in large vessels, thorax scapula, region morphology.

283
00:38:31,490 --> 00:38:37,459
This is high capillary density. A lot more blood is being used.

284
00:38:37,460 --> 00:38:41,570
This with this tissue. There's a lot more mitochondria.

285
00:38:43,150 --> 00:38:50,350
Yeah. Has an extensive innovation from the sympathetic nervous system.

286
00:38:50,660 --> 00:38:57,150
There's a lot more sympathetic nerves, and its primary function is the generation.

287
00:38:59,290 --> 00:39:07,270
Here's a cross-section of this beige adipose tissue or inducible brown adipose tissue or on fat.

288
00:39:07,410 --> 00:39:20,140
Let's see. So it kind of looks like white adipose tissue, except you start to see within this tissue some what appear to be brown sites.

289
00:39:20,560 --> 00:39:23,650
Actually, this is the basic type of sites that you're seeing here.

290
00:39:24,760 --> 00:39:31,170
There is this huge increase in mitochondrial density. There's more capillaries and there's a greater ability to generate heat.

291
00:39:34,580 --> 00:39:40,610
So beige or bright adipocytes. They're also located in the subject macular region.

292
00:39:41,540 --> 00:39:47,000
And what you see here in the brown stain is this uncoupling protein expression.

293
00:39:48,800 --> 00:39:55,070
And the uncoupling protein are expressed in the beige adipose tissue.

294
00:39:55,070 --> 00:40:02,990
And you can actually brown or beige regions of white adipose tissue that contain the beige at the sites,

295
00:40:03,020 --> 00:40:06,020
and they can increase their uncoupling protein expression.

296
00:40:06,560 --> 00:40:13,700
And this can be done pharmacologically by giving them a cart of catecholamines like drug.

297
00:40:15,740 --> 00:40:22,459
And the thing I want you to remember about this adipose tissue that it's actually distinct from,

298
00:40:22,460 --> 00:40:27,320
brown adipose tissue has a distinct origin in terms of the cell type.

299
00:40:29,870 --> 00:40:32,990
So, yeah, it's one that I make sure I heard right.

300
00:40:33,770 --> 00:40:38,509
So did you say it's located both super killer and Sub Scapula?

301
00:40:38,510 --> 00:40:45,350
Both Yeah. Yeah, I think it's the same regions that you might find brown adipose tissue, but other, other regions as well.

302
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:51,200
Um, here's the distinct distinction between the different types in terms of their origin.

303
00:40:52,130 --> 00:41:01,760
So the way you figure out how cells differentiate into mature cells is to get stem cells.

304
00:41:02,660 --> 00:41:06,320
And stem cells have all kinds of different markers on their surface,

305
00:41:07,100 --> 00:41:18,410
and then different markers can be used to kind of follow that cell type as it matures and becomes a functional cell in an adult and more in culture.

306
00:41:19,430 --> 00:41:29,990
So if you take a stem cell, you can get within different adipose tissue depots within developing an embryo.

307
00:41:30,890 --> 00:41:36,830
You can get these stem cells and they have different markers on their surface.

308
00:41:37,870 --> 00:41:46,000
So this particular stem cell has this mark marker pack seven and m.y five.

309
00:41:46,030 --> 00:41:53,079
These are these are stem cells that if treated under the right conditions and culture,

310
00:41:53,080 --> 00:41:59,229
now our culture, you put them in different different types of mediators in the culture.

311
00:41:59,230 --> 00:42:10,090
You can get that precursor cell to differentiate into a muscle cell or a mine site or a brown adipocyte precursor to that as it matures.

312
00:42:10,150 --> 00:42:15,670
You can tell that you have distinct, different, distinctly different cell types.

313
00:42:15,940 --> 00:42:21,190
Here's a biosensor that would eventually become part of the muscle.

314
00:42:21,670 --> 00:42:23,350
And here's a brown adipocytes.

315
00:42:26,180 --> 00:42:33,560
The precursor of white and beige adipose tissue seemed to have the same origin in terms of the stem cell that it comes from.

316
00:42:34,640 --> 00:42:41,420
And under certain conditions, this particular stem cell would diverge to white or beige precursor.

317
00:42:42,670 --> 00:42:49,030
And then you would get a white adipose, a white adipocyte, or an active beige adipocyte.

318
00:42:49,870 --> 00:42:58,599
And the way that these beige precursors differentiate is exposure to things that can activate the sympathetic nervous system,

319
00:42:58,600 --> 00:43:03,940
such as cold temperature. And then these cells differentiate into an activity to get the site,

320
00:43:05,490 --> 00:43:14,800
whether for biology of the beige adipocytes might change under warm conditions is an area of active research.

321
00:43:15,130 --> 00:43:24,550
They become inactivation type of sites and have a larger vacuole under those types of conditions where there isn't the same supply of catecholamines.

322
00:43:25,180 --> 00:43:35,380
This is an active area of research. How do the different sites generate heat?

323
00:43:37,060 --> 00:43:40,600
This through the upregulation of these uncoupling proteins.

324
00:43:42,040 --> 00:43:56,420
And in this diagram, it shows you the mitochondria within the cell and you have fatty acids and glucose that can be taken up into Andrea.

325
00:43:56,950 --> 00:44:03,220
And there are many steps before it is actually taken up and in the mitochondria, as you know, at 630.

326
00:44:05,500 --> 00:44:12,309
The point of this diagram is to show you that the uncoupling proteins are embedded

327
00:44:12,310 --> 00:44:22,629
in the mitochondria and they are responsible for either the generation of heat,

328
00:44:22,630 --> 00:44:27,970
in this case, the uncoupling protein. And then you have another type of a transporter.

329
00:44:28,870 --> 00:44:38,140
We have an ATP synthase, and here you have the electron transport chain being being active.

330
00:44:38,740 --> 00:44:42,160
You have an increase in the concentration of hydrogen ions.

331
00:44:42,160 --> 00:44:55,300
And in this location within the mitochondria, the hydrogen is taken up inside the cell and it's converted to ATP.

332
00:44:55,630 --> 00:44:59,920
And this is a form of energy that can now perform work.

333
00:45:01,090 --> 00:45:07,450
What uncoupling proteins do is that instead of generating ATP, they generate heat.

334
00:45:08,140 --> 00:45:15,560
And the more uncoupling proteins you have expressed in the mitochondria, the greater your ability to generate charge.

335
00:45:16,390 --> 00:45:22,120
So this is the major distinction between brown adipose tissue and other types of it.

336
00:45:22,120 --> 00:45:26,620
Did the science the higher level of protein expression mitochondria.

337
00:45:31,030 --> 00:45:36,220
So here's the uncoupling of couples like respiratory cheating,

338
00:45:36,700 --> 00:45:42,999
lots of data phosphorylation and kind of mitochondria protons transit down the

339
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:48,040
electrochemical gradient across the inner membrane through the uncoupling proteins here,

340
00:45:49,720 --> 00:45:52,840
and they generate heat rather than ATP.

341
00:45:56,780 --> 00:45:59,630
And it's important to me and such generations I mentioned.

342
00:46:00,020 --> 00:46:07,580
Let's take a closer look in terms of the differences between brown and brown and white adipose tissue.

343
00:46:09,320 --> 00:46:12,650
It's quite adipose tissue. Here's brown adipose tissue.

344
00:46:14,210 --> 00:46:20,210
If we were to take these same tissues and this is hematoxylin and isn't stained,

345
00:46:20,510 --> 00:46:27,680
we would stay in the same tissues with an antibiotic that has a green fluorescent tag on it.

346
00:46:28,640 --> 00:46:39,350
You would be able to see the level of expression of the uncoupling protein one in this tissue, and it's much, much higher in the brown tissue.

347
00:46:39,360 --> 00:46:42,800
You see a little bit of staining here in the white adipose tissue.

348
00:46:43,520 --> 00:46:50,420
So it's a much higher standing uncoupling approach of the brown adipose tissue.

349
00:46:55,000 --> 00:47:02,290
What about? What does this look like in people and how in the world would you be able to assess this?

350
00:47:03,530 --> 00:47:12,530
So because of the location of brown adipose tissue in humans and because of its level of expression, it's difficult to assess.

351
00:47:14,210 --> 00:47:20,930
So here's a diagram or an illustration from a paper published a while ago.

352
00:47:21,680 --> 00:47:24,740
This is called Activated Brown Adipose Tissue in Healthy Men.

353
00:47:26,210 --> 00:47:32,450
And that one here shows the a portion of this illustration.

354
00:47:33,170 --> 00:47:42,530
This is the high level of brown adipose tissue in women. And so, as I told you before, these are the locations of brown at post tissue.

355
00:47:43,100 --> 00:47:46,170
And it's being taken up.

356
00:47:47,240 --> 00:47:57,220
And so what's being taken up here? You have a label of four deoxy glucose, 18 flower deoxy glucose.

357
00:47:57,230 --> 00:48:08,809
This is a positron emitter. So they the investigators in this study had to use what's known as positron emission tomography to to

358
00:48:08,810 --> 00:48:16,640
create these illustrations or these maps to where to figure out where this brown adipose tissue is.

359
00:48:16,880 --> 00:48:20,240
So they're measuring essentially brown adipose tissue activity.

360
00:48:21,110 --> 00:48:26,360
And the darker color corresponds to the tissues that are more active.

361
00:48:27,260 --> 00:48:34,909
So the dark the black stain of the black image here in this PET scan was shown here.

362
00:48:34,910 --> 00:48:39,290
At number one indicates a high level of brown adipose tissue activity.

363
00:48:40,040 --> 00:48:43,070
And in this group of individuals, these were lain individuals.

364
00:48:43,820 --> 00:48:47,900
And as we increase the amount of white adipose tissue.

365
00:48:49,500 --> 00:48:56,400
In medium and high adipose tissue, somebody with a higher BMI can see that the level of brown, adipose tissue declines.

366
00:48:57,150 --> 00:49:03,690
So until we have somebody with medium brown adipose tissue and then here you have lower

367
00:49:03,690 --> 00:49:10,890
levels of brown adipose tissue in men with obesity in terms of their exact location,

368
00:49:11,460 --> 00:49:18,030
you have to take the pet image and then you have to also acquire CT scans.

369
00:49:18,030 --> 00:49:20,069
So that's what's shown here in this next image.

370
00:49:20,070 --> 00:49:26,850
And then you overlay the two and you can find the location of these different adipose tissue, brown adipose tissue adipose.

371
00:49:27,660 --> 00:49:39,600
And because they're located too close to vital organs, because they're in the target for a reason, really difficult to access this tissue.

372
00:49:39,600 --> 00:49:48,710
And in terms of getting a biopsy of brown adipose tissue and because of that, this is how you measure brown adipose tissue.

373
00:49:48,810 --> 00:49:56,580
You measure its activity using a PET scanner. We talked a bit about cold exposure.

374
00:49:56,670 --> 00:50:08,700
What cold exposure does is it increases the release of catecholamines that stimulate brown adipose tissue activity.

375
00:50:09,720 --> 00:50:19,500
So here is somebody who's been exposed to cold and that here's a thermal neutral condition and you see the darker image on the left.

376
00:50:19,500 --> 00:50:25,110
That's cold exposure and individuals have thermal neutral conditions.

377
00:50:25,650 --> 00:50:31,080
So this indicates that the cold temperature can activate brown adipose tissue and increase its activity.

378
00:50:36,210 --> 00:50:38,750
So that's what happens. All right.

379
00:50:39,760 --> 00:50:50,260
So when we look at brown adipose activity with increasing PMI, we find that whether you measure BMI or body fat percentage,

380
00:50:50,980 --> 00:51:00,250
the brown adipose tissue activity declines as you get increasing levels of BMI or increasing levels of body

381
00:51:00,250 --> 00:51:10,150
fat percentage brown adipose tissue levels decline with a higher body mass with a higher body fat percentage.

382
00:51:15,370 --> 00:51:20,200
The question in terms of when we've looked at men so far, what about women,

383
00:51:20,320 --> 00:51:24,460
which is their brown adipose tissue activity level, it's actually higher than men.

384
00:51:25,830 --> 00:51:43,469
So that's what's shown here. So this is the prevalence of of of maximal activity of brown adipose tissue percent on the Y axis and on the X axis,

385
00:51:43,470 --> 00:51:45,630
you have been outdoor temperature.

386
00:51:46,860 --> 00:51:56,400
So these this data was collected during a calendar year in which you had warm ambient temperature and low ambient temperature.

387
00:51:56,880 --> 00:52:07,740
And under all of these conditions, you find that women have a higher prevalence of maximal brown adipose tissue activity compared to men.

388
00:52:08,780 --> 00:52:16,460
And that the activity of the brown adipose tissue actually declines as the ambient temperature or temperature increases.

389
00:52:20,540 --> 00:52:25,480
Some other things that we talked about. Did you have a question to ask?

390
00:52:25,490 --> 00:52:30,350
Are you going to go over why this might be so?

391
00:52:30,380 --> 00:52:38,570
Yeah. So with men and women. So it's thought that women require more brown adipose tissue, perhaps because they're children.

392
00:52:38,600 --> 00:52:49,909
Right. So it's because of this need for childcare and childbearing that there's a greater need for worming and brown adipose tissue.

393
00:52:49,910 --> 00:52:56,330
And that's the theory behind this. Yeah.

394
00:52:57,800 --> 00:53:04,790
So similarly, women just have more body fat percentage in general.

395
00:53:04,820 --> 00:53:16,580
Yes. So is it thought that that that differential in body fat is largely due to brown tissue as opposed to white and tissue like differential?

396
00:53:16,640 --> 00:53:19,700
And if so, then to women's prevent women. Yeah.

397
00:53:19,970 --> 00:53:26,900
So like the increase. Right. So what you're saying just because women in general have more like that percentage than men,

398
00:53:26,960 --> 00:53:31,400
and that might explain why we're seeing also seeing higher levels of brown adipose tissue women.

399
00:53:31,460 --> 00:53:38,360
What I was wondering if like so if you have like 5% as a male as like 5% and the woman has a 20% body fat.

400
00:53:38,690 --> 00:53:54,679
So is that like 15%? Is that want like due primarily to brown adipose tissue increase over men or that's so the amount in terms of the

401
00:53:54,680 --> 00:54:00,290
volume of brown adipose tissue is going to be very low and it's going to be difficult to measure from that standpoint.

402
00:54:01,040 --> 00:54:09,080
So perhaps I don't know if it's known or difficult to figure that out because we measure that differently.

403
00:54:09,740 --> 00:54:15,620
We measure brown adipose tissue based on their activity, not their volume or cross-sectional area.

404
00:54:15,980 --> 00:54:26,870
You could you could do that, but it would be kind of difficult to, you know, based on this this type of this method of acquiring this sort of data.

405
00:54:28,180 --> 00:54:34,380
It's an interesting question. And I don't know if anybody's been able to answer that.

406
00:54:36,770 --> 00:54:39,970
So when we look at some other things you have, Kimmy.

407
00:54:39,990 --> 00:54:41,750
What about the first part of the question?

408
00:54:41,750 --> 00:54:49,730
Like just the fact that women tend to have more body fat, like is that controlled for in this with having, you know, women having more brown?

409
00:54:50,840 --> 00:54:56,600
Oh, I see this question here. Is there is there I don't remember the sequence.

410
00:55:00,790 --> 00:55:20,320
Okay. It's not explained in this particular figure.

411
00:55:22,500 --> 00:55:35,320
Um, I'd have to go back to the paper and look at the fat detail in terms of other measures of adiposity in that period for that figure.

412
00:55:36,490 --> 00:55:48,570
It's an interesting question, though. So looking at patients with detectable brown adipose tissue by age, it declines.

413
00:55:49,110 --> 00:55:54,390
And again, this is brown adipose tissue activity. So as you get older, the activity declines.

414
00:55:56,640 --> 00:56:00,020
So it is not certain body mass index.

415
00:56:00,490 --> 00:56:02,880
I showed you some other examples of it declining.

416
00:56:03,600 --> 00:56:12,240
And then when we look at glucose homeostasis with individuals who have higher levels of blood glucose,

417
00:56:12,720 --> 00:56:15,960
um, brown adipose tissue seems to decline as well.

418
00:56:17,520 --> 00:56:20,600
Whether or not this a cause and effect relationship, I don't know.

419
00:56:20,610 --> 00:56:37,450
This is essentially an observation. So to summarize, brown adipose tissue generates heat by the upregulation of the coupling proteins.

420
00:56:39,310 --> 00:56:42,880
It increases with decreasing environmental temperature.

421
00:56:44,210 --> 00:56:47,500
It declines with age and increasing body fat percentage.

422
00:56:48,880 --> 00:56:55,210
And it's something that is important in human physiology.

423
00:56:57,940 --> 00:57:03,940
Do. This is my question to your sensation of feeling cold in the fall versus in the spring.

424
00:57:04,030 --> 00:57:07,720
Perhaps this is related to brown adipose tissue activity.

425
00:57:08,290 --> 00:57:12,139
So what does 50 degrees feel like to you now? That cold?

426
00:57:12,140 --> 00:57:14,290
Do you need a coat when you go outside?

427
00:57:15,030 --> 00:57:22,480
You have a tendency to wear sweat pants or leggings when you go to exercise when it's 50 degrees right now in the fall.

428
00:57:22,550 --> 00:57:30,610
Now you say no. Some of you say yes. That sensation of temperature differ in the fall compared to the spring.

429
00:57:31,070 --> 00:57:32,290
Yes, some of you are saying, yeah,

430
00:57:33,040 --> 00:57:44,349
perhaps that's due to brown adipose tissue activity where it's more active and that's spring because you've just come out of winter as perhaps the

431
00:57:44,350 --> 00:57:53,620
activity of that adipose tissue is greater during that time compared to the fall when you've got the warm temperatures and run out of tissues.

432
00:57:53,620 --> 00:58:03,400
Not yeah. So people that live in like Alaska or like really cold climates just have more active brown adipose tissue all the time.

433
00:58:03,700 --> 00:58:08,050
You would think so, yeah. Based on what we've seen in these studies.

434
00:58:08,110 --> 00:58:14,380
Yeah. But what could disrupt that or.

435
00:58:15,720 --> 00:58:21,140
Negate that kind of hypothesis. At BMI.

436
00:58:22,100 --> 00:58:25,910
Well, in terms of body temperature, she adds, yes.

437
00:58:26,540 --> 00:58:33,320
If you're always warm, right, you're always in warm conditions because of the way you dress or the temperature of your household.

438
00:58:33,740 --> 00:58:41,320
That could give you a lot of variability. Yeah, back to the comparison between 20 degrees in the fall and spring.

439
00:58:41,330 --> 00:58:47,870
So you're saying like in the fall it should feel colder or in the spring it should feel.

440
00:58:48,020 --> 00:58:56,660
You should feel. Based on the theory that higher ambient temperatures is associated with lower brown adipose tissue,

441
00:58:56,780 --> 00:59:03,910
you would feel colder in the fall than you do in the spring. But this might not be true with everyone else.

442
00:59:04,200 --> 00:59:11,070
There can be quite a bit of variability here. So what happens when you get older?

443
00:59:11,730 --> 00:59:17,880
What happens to adipose tissue function as you get older? Well, it declines.

444
00:59:19,090 --> 00:59:23,530
And it declines because of this process called senescence.

445
00:59:24,870 --> 00:59:30,629
So one of the things that you'll notice as people age is that subcutaneous

446
00:59:30,630 --> 00:59:36,750
adipose tissue functions and the amount of subcutaneous adipose tissue decline.

447
00:59:37,620 --> 00:59:50,250
First, notice it in people's faces where there seems to be less adipose tissue around and the ocular sockets where people,

448
00:59:50,580 --> 01:00:00,450
the appearance of their eyes changes and it changes because the amount of adipose tissue in this region declines.

449
01:00:01,350 --> 01:00:02,459
And as you get older,

450
01:00:02,460 --> 01:00:09,870
you'll notice that the amount of subcutaneous adipose tissue on your hands and your arms and your legs starts to decline as well.

451
01:00:10,740 --> 01:00:17,430
Your skin appears to have no sort of bitterness, adipose tissue in your hands.

452
01:00:17,910 --> 01:00:26,070
This happens to most people. So the process that would describe that is senescence.

453
01:00:26,580 --> 01:00:35,640
And what happens is the pre adipocytes or I should say going back to the same kind of stem cells that can eventually become adipocytes,

454
01:00:37,590 --> 01:00:42,990
they can't undergo the same maturation processes.

455
01:00:44,010 --> 01:00:50,310
And as a consequence, you get cell types that can't mature into adipocytes.

456
01:00:51,210 --> 01:00:59,460
So the subcutaneous adipose tissue actually starts to decline with brown adipose tissue.

457
01:00:59,580 --> 01:01:03,810
You see the same kind of an effect, but the mechanism is a little bit different.

458
01:01:04,800 --> 01:01:13,590
And an aging when you have less brown adipose tissue, it's thought that the amounts in the activity actually decline.

459
01:01:13,590 --> 01:01:16,799
And in general, as you get older, sympathetic,

460
01:01:16,800 --> 01:01:25,530
nervous system activity declines and this is thought to be one of the contributing factors for a decrease in adipose tissue.

461
01:01:26,340 --> 01:01:31,799
And then you have this increase in the expression of this transcription factor.

462
01:01:31,800 --> 01:01:40,680
Foxo 83 which also was thought to contribute to a declining population of brown adipocytes with aging.

463
01:01:42,780 --> 01:01:49,739
And so they're just a little bit go if it can't go into the subcutaneous adipose tissue,

464
01:01:49,740 --> 01:01:56,490
which is most of the part of your body that you store excess triglycerides in the subcutaneous compartment.

465
01:01:58,170 --> 01:02:07,440
Well, it has to go somewhere. And a lot of it goes into the visceral fat part of the abdominal visceral, adipose tissue compartment, for instance.

466
01:02:08,850 --> 01:02:11,250
So as we get older because of this.

467
01:02:13,290 --> 01:02:21,600
We see the shift in adiposity should be, whereas the subcutaneous compartment gets smaller as their compartment gets bigger.

468
01:02:23,280 --> 01:02:34,470
And associated with this shift is you can have a situation where you see an increase in blood cell recruitment in the form of monocytes.

469
01:02:35,050 --> 01:02:42,360
You can see an increase in the classical pro-inflammatory cytokines and other molecules.

470
01:02:43,410 --> 01:02:45,960
Talk about the different kinds here in the next lecture.

471
01:02:47,870 --> 01:02:54,700
And then the levels of these anti-inflammatory mediators produced by adipose tissue also declined.

472
01:02:54,710 --> 01:02:58,280
So you get an increase in pro-inflammatory and a decrease in anti-inflammatory.

473
01:03:00,390 --> 01:03:04,140
You'll also see a decline in sex hormones with aging.

474
01:03:04,200 --> 01:03:06,750
And this can affect this process as well.

475
01:03:08,060 --> 01:03:18,800
It can lead to an increase in the shift of lipids within adipose tissue, increasing the size around the abdomen and then the visceral compartment.

476
01:03:20,720 --> 01:03:24,790
The bone marrow is really interesting. You have bone marrow, adipose tissue.

477
01:03:24,800 --> 01:03:28,610
And for a long time it was thought to just kind of take up space.

478
01:03:29,540 --> 01:03:39,020
It was thought to take up the space left by declining numbers of cells that would become circulating blood cells.

479
01:03:40,130 --> 01:03:47,270
So hematopoietic declines with age, the numbers of cells, the volume of space that it takes up in the bone declines.

480
01:03:48,500 --> 01:03:58,070
And what takes up the space? The brown marrow that I'm sorry, bone marrow, adipose tissue, DNA or M-80 marrow, adipose tissue.

481
01:03:58,520 --> 01:04:02,780
And those adipocytes produce lots of adiponectin.

482
01:04:03,950 --> 01:04:09,940
And so different actin levels arise as you get older to. Exactly what a difference actually does.

483
01:04:10,270 --> 01:04:12,790
We're going to talk about that a lot in the next lecture.

484
01:04:13,930 --> 01:04:23,200
So with this change you get, you can you can have if you have this imbalance of lipids now, you can get a topic,

485
01:04:23,200 --> 01:04:29,680
lipid deposition and greater insulin resistance and increase inflammation and chronic disease associated with this change.

486
01:04:30,190 --> 01:04:34,570
If your adipose tissue now can no longer function normally.

487
01:04:35,540 --> 01:04:44,920
Okay. This can happen. So here's the summary with age.

488
01:04:45,040 --> 01:04:48,910
Aging and adipose tissue, you lose subcutaneous adipose tissue.

489
01:04:49,360 --> 01:04:57,670
And that's because the progenitor cells that would become the mature deficits, they functionally decline.

490
01:04:58,690 --> 01:05:02,320
The lipids can go into the visceral, adipose tissue compartment.

491
01:05:03,070 --> 01:05:06,370
And then there's this increase in the bone marrow, adipose tissue.

492
01:05:07,330 --> 01:05:13,780
And this increases the synthesis of hormones produced by the adipocytes.

493
01:05:14,950 --> 01:05:21,880
In the visceral, adipose tissue compartment, you have an increase in these pro-inflammatory cytokines and depictions,

494
01:05:22,660 --> 01:05:26,530
and this can lead to elevated glucose and insulin resistance.

495
01:05:27,400 --> 01:05:36,610
If there is an impairment in the function overall function over the total body of the adipose tissue, you can get ectopic lipid deposition.

496
01:05:38,050 --> 01:05:44,620
And this can lead to AIDS related disease more prevalent in those who have obesity.

497
01:05:49,640 --> 01:05:54,110
And here are some of the some of the conditions we'll talk about later in the semester.

498
01:05:54,470 --> 01:05:59,570
Type two diabetes, certain types of cancer, cardiovascular disease, dementia, etc.

499
01:06:04,000 --> 01:06:12,010
And you'll also see with age increase oxidative stress and greater systemic inflammation.

500
01:06:13,220 --> 01:06:16,790
Okay. So that's a function of adipose tissue.

501
01:06:17,150 --> 01:06:22,400
Bottom line thing, I want you to remember, it's the function of adipose tissue that's more important than anything else.

502
01:06:22,700 --> 01:06:29,030
Yes, there are these regional differences, but it's function that is most important.

503
01:06:47,840 --> 01:06:57,590
So what you've heard so far focused on the ability of the sites to sequester lipid, to produce heat.

504
01:06:58,010 --> 01:07:04,460
And a little bit about their endocrine function. It's the biggest endocrine gland in your body.

505
01:07:04,760 --> 01:07:10,460
It secretes many different factors that play an important role in physiology.

506
01:07:11,420 --> 01:07:17,450
So I'm going to focus on the Adipocytes and then I'll mention some other things.

507
01:07:17,930 --> 01:07:21,049
But think of adipose tissue.

508
01:07:21,050 --> 01:07:31,400
It's not only a storage depot, but as an endocrinologist. So for this particular lecture in terms of learning objectives.

509
01:07:32,780 --> 01:07:36,230
To understand the powertrain and endocrine functions of adipose tissue.

510
01:07:36,560 --> 01:07:45,470
Paragon functions relate to the process of expansion of the adipose tissue, white adipose tissue,

511
01:07:46,430 --> 01:07:53,900
endocrine and production of factors that circulate in blood and reach other tissues and affect other physiologic processes.

512
01:07:56,570 --> 01:08:08,060
I want you to be able to define to give examples of adipose tissue secrete factors, depictions of the life of times and example my bra is.

513
01:08:10,030 --> 01:08:14,260
Understand how adipose tissue secreted factors affect adipocyte function.

514
01:08:15,580 --> 01:08:21,670
So this is a really important in terms of glucose and lipid homeostasis.

515
01:08:22,180 --> 01:08:29,050
And then finally to identify some of the properties of different kinds of kinds and exosomes on our

516
01:08:29,080 --> 01:08:34,090
knees and their distinctive roles in the development of cardiovascular cardiometabolic disease.

517
01:08:36,650 --> 01:08:40,900
Okay. So I showed you this figure before.

518
01:08:41,050 --> 01:08:47,620
Now we're going to pay more attention to what's going on in adipose tissue as it expands.

519
01:08:48,880 --> 01:08:52,780
So within the adipose tissue, we have different cell types.

520
01:08:52,780 --> 01:08:56,980
Predominantly you have these adipocytes now and pre adipocytes.

521
01:08:57,150 --> 01:09:05,560
You have a lot of immune cells in here and you have some extracellular matrix in here as well that have a supportive role.

522
01:09:07,660 --> 01:09:10,420
And then within this tissue match,

523
01:09:10,420 --> 01:09:20,680
you have these red cells that are macrophages and the macrophages play an important role or whether or not these adipocytes are the adipose tissue.

524
01:09:20,710 --> 01:09:27,010
In this particular illustration, expand by hypertrophy or hyperplasia.

525
01:09:28,270 --> 01:09:31,540
In general, in a pro-inflammatory environment,

526
01:09:31,960 --> 01:09:45,400
the adipose tissue will expand to create more active human cells that are of larger diameter and the pro-inflammatory environment.

527
01:09:45,700 --> 01:10:02,500
Cytokines in general inhibit the type of genesis and there are anti-inflammatory factors within adipose tissue that can promote a different genesis.

528
01:10:03,360 --> 01:10:10,510
I gave you two. I'll give you two examples here. It's secreted frizzled proteins.

529
01:10:10,690 --> 01:10:14,380
This is some five and a different act.

530
01:10:15,220 --> 01:10:24,280
Those are the anti-inflammatory kinds that would promote expansion of adipose tissue through the process of hyperplasia.

531
01:10:28,550 --> 01:10:38,110
So this this is the reference to the pair cringe function of adipose tissue actors are released you

532
01:10:38,180 --> 01:10:44,809
have anti-inflammatory depictions as if our P5 in a different acting and then you have pro-inflammatory

533
01:10:44,810 --> 01:10:55,310
depictions that promote these promote a different genesis and hypoplasia the pro-inflammatory signals this

534
01:10:55,310 --> 01:11:04,070
transcription factor five and tumor necrosis factor alpha shown here that are produced by the macrophage.

535
01:11:04,970 --> 01:11:08,660
What these do to say inhibit a different genesis.

536
01:11:09,990 --> 01:11:14,880
So you have larger adipocytes as that adipose tissue mass increases.

537
01:11:16,120 --> 01:11:21,550
And with greater diameter and then you have less hyperplasia.

538
01:11:23,650 --> 01:11:31,450
And this impairs the function of adipose tissue in terms of its ability to serve as a deep hole to store excess lipids.

539
01:11:33,880 --> 01:11:37,180
Yeah. So I see a question about the way the bullet points are written.

540
01:11:37,180 --> 01:11:41,930
So the first bullet point promotes a biogenesis hypoplasia, then the pro-inflammatory.

541
01:11:41,930 --> 01:11:47,890
It goes with the inhibit assay. It's just like those are the two bullet points that go together.

542
01:11:54,890 --> 01:12:01,400
Oh, I see. We hear the. So can you repeat that point?

543
01:12:01,410 --> 01:12:07,940
I just wanted to make sure that the anti federated becomes a go along with the second bullet point, but they're all just in a row.

544
01:12:07,940 --> 01:12:10,320
So I want to make sure I know which I see what you're saying. Yeah.

545
01:12:10,580 --> 01:12:17,630
So like the first two bullet points go to that in the last two bullet points and it's what would it help if I number them.

546
01:12:19,250 --> 01:12:23,750
That distinction. But then again.

547
01:12:23,960 --> 01:12:29,330
Or maybe color code. Color code. Okay. I mean, we can do some color.

548
01:12:57,380 --> 01:13:15,340
Okay. So here is a diagram, an illustration showing you the increase.

549
01:13:15,340 --> 01:13:26,209
And it devastates sites with increasing ad lipids within the different sites.

550
01:13:26,210 --> 01:13:32,740
They're getting bigger here. So this is the normal metabolic function, obviously,

551
01:13:33,220 --> 01:13:45,540
with metabolic mild metabolic dysfunction be so full of dysfunction here we're looking at changes that occur within the cells that

552
01:13:45,550 --> 01:13:57,790
accumulate within the capillaries in the adipose tissue depot and the activation state of the macrophages within this population.

553
01:13:59,560 --> 01:14:08,049
So let's start over here on the left where you have an adipose tissue that's functioning in such a way

554
01:14:08,050 --> 01:14:16,990
that you have normal metabolic function and you have really a quiescent state in terms of inflammation,

555
01:14:18,610 --> 01:14:27,729
you have metabolic control and you have a typical vascular function where the

556
01:14:27,730 --> 01:14:35,350
deposits can now receive appropriate blood supply to maintain this this function.

557
01:14:35,860 --> 01:14:47,589
Okay. Now, as these adipocytes are producing mediators now on the landscape of their ability to

558
01:14:47,590 --> 01:14:54,610
secrete these adipocyte derived mediators changes as these adipocytes change in diameter.

559
01:14:55,960 --> 01:15:08,390
So here in in that normal metabolic functional mean, you have anti-inflammatory of different kinds, predominating, adiponectin, etc.

560
01:15:08,390 --> 01:15:14,380
FP five. As the adipocytes increase in size.

561
01:15:15,620 --> 01:15:23,480
And the vascular supply to this tissue declines or doesn't keep up.

562
01:15:25,220 --> 01:15:31,580
We start to see some problems with an increase in the balance or an increase in inflammation.

563
01:15:32,660 --> 01:15:41,840
So the balance changes here. We have some more pro-inflammatory signals introduced by the adipose tissue.

564
01:15:42,740 --> 01:15:51,950
Here is a list of significance and cytokines that are produced in greater quantities as this adipose tissue mass increases.

565
01:15:54,140 --> 01:15:59,780
You notice that the color of these cells in between the individual adipocytes changes too.

566
01:16:00,830 --> 01:16:07,790
So you're getting more immune cells. Adipocytes are getting larger and they're changing color.

567
01:16:08,060 --> 01:16:18,710
What does that mean? The green adipocytes correspond to this M2 phenotype and the red adipocytes correspond to this M1 phenotype.

568
01:16:20,300 --> 01:16:33,440
The M2 phenotype is a type of macrophage that plays an important role in tissue remodeling, whereas the M1 macrophage is pro-inflammatory.

569
01:16:33,830 --> 01:16:40,610
It secretes pro-inflammatory cytokines that can affect different chances.

570
01:16:42,470 --> 01:16:48,500
Did you have a question? I just. You said. You said green and red adipocytes converted into red macrophages.

571
01:16:48,610 --> 01:16:50,330
Green red macrophages. Sorry about that.

572
01:16:52,850 --> 01:17:01,910
And as this occurs, you get more immune cells, you start to see more inflammation and you start to see a decline in metabolic control.

573
01:17:03,560 --> 01:17:12,170
Vascular function here. Well, you have bigger adipocytes here in the same vascular supply, and that's okay right now.

574
01:17:12,170 --> 01:17:19,990
But as that increases now you have lots of these red colored macrophages.

575
01:17:20,000 --> 01:17:23,240
You get more of these dark stained cells.

576
01:17:23,270 --> 01:17:34,670
These are t cells. They come in and they affect the the actual of the morphology should say morphology, the activity of the M1 macrophage.

577
01:17:35,720 --> 01:17:42,440
It's thought that the T cells actually control this transition from the M two to the M1 phenotype.

578
01:17:43,340 --> 01:17:54,079
Over here we have M2 macrophages in green, your M2 macrophages in the middle while metabolic function, full metabolic dysfunction.

579
01:17:54,080 --> 01:17:58,430
We get lots of these red macrophages.

580
01:17:59,060 --> 01:18:08,120
Okay, now so the M2 macrophages can become M1 macrophages, you can recruit more of these as well.

581
01:18:08,720 --> 01:18:14,090
And the recruitment comes into play and then all the way over here and then from the loss of metabolic control here.

582
01:18:15,590 --> 01:18:19,640
So you have more of these inflammatory cells coming in.

583
01:18:21,170 --> 01:18:27,530
And it's not it's not that they're being directed by this here, the dark blue or darker blue cells.

584
01:18:27,530 --> 01:18:35,540
These are T cells. And they are thought to be responsible for the switch from the two to the M1 phenotype, get more inflammation.

585
01:18:36,350 --> 01:18:38,900
And then the center here you have the cell death occurring.

586
01:18:39,620 --> 01:18:46,190
You have an adipocyte here that's undergoing tumor ptosis and these macrophages are coming in and clearing the adipocytes.

587
01:18:48,850 --> 01:18:55,300
And so they're releasing these proinflammatory mediators that have effects locally.

588
01:18:56,080 --> 01:18:59,470
They also affect the recruitment of cells into the adipose tissue.

589
01:19:00,640 --> 01:19:06,760
So you're going to get more cells recruited, more macrophages, more T-cells, more everything.

590
01:19:07,030 --> 01:19:11,650
Every immune cell has been identified in adipose tissue.

591
01:19:12,430 --> 01:19:17,820
And exactly why they're in adipose tissue is not abundantly clear.

592
01:19:18,870 --> 01:19:23,630
We know that he macrophages to remodel tissues and that kind of makes sense while they're there.

593
01:19:23,640 --> 01:19:27,480
But whether t cells are there, we're not really sure why that is.

594
01:19:28,950 --> 01:19:36,329
So this transition from the M2 to the M1 phenotype is thought to be an important

595
01:19:36,330 --> 01:19:40,890
driver for this proinflammatory response and loss of metabolic control.

596
01:19:42,540 --> 01:19:49,740
Some of the initial studies done to identify this process were done actually here at the University of Michigan.

597
01:19:50,580 --> 01:19:58,461
Lemming, who's in pediatrics? He was the one who came up with this paradigm where you have the shift from the M2 to the M1.
