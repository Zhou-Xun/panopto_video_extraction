1
00:00:22,940 --> 00:01:06,680
That's. I think so.

2
00:01:14,570 --> 00:01:24,320
And it was quickly followed up in terms.

3
00:01:43,050 --> 00:01:47,340
Good morning. Let's get started. Here's my plan for today.

4
00:01:48,390 --> 00:01:57,140
So I first the world got over this. You are concerned, as I said, that this is the first step that we like to collect data.

5
00:01:57,450 --> 00:02:09,090
So it's very necessary that we have to implement and carry out, as you know, the beginning of being a flash.

6
00:02:09,540 --> 00:02:12,569
So I will go over these, you know, informed,

7
00:02:12,570 --> 00:02:21,510
concerned to tell you what are the basic sort of elements required in the construction of informed consent.

8
00:02:21,570 --> 00:02:27,960
Of course, our study is simple, and if you are involved in some more sophisticated studies,

9
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:37,710
like some large scale clinical trial or multicenter clinical studies that is informed consent, it would be even more complicated.

10
00:02:37,720 --> 00:02:41,610
But over all of that, some basic elements are there.

11
00:02:41,620 --> 00:02:51,870
And so I will go over it. And at the end of the lecture, please handle your informed concerns so that we can move forward.

12
00:02:52,390 --> 00:03:01,080
I think, you know, because we are going to use the data from the plus to round the clay tablets and also, you know,

13
00:03:02,340 --> 00:03:12,690
do some of the group project at this moment that the class the enrollment is still a little bit unsettled so that I have to wait a little bit.

14
00:03:12,690 --> 00:03:18,650
And before we so start, I will start to randomize the will.

15
00:03:19,210 --> 00:03:28,500
SIMON And you can do tweet after the group assignment is starting, you know, rearrange you a little bit here or there.

16
00:03:28,740 --> 00:03:33,940
And also, I'm in the process of getting our GSI for this class.

17
00:03:33,940 --> 00:03:43,409
So so we reach this sort of threshold 50 and so where the title how they decide for this course.

18
00:03:43,410 --> 00:03:53,790
I am so happy that we have extra help from someone who took the class before to to do so.

19
00:03:54,690 --> 00:04:04,890
And after I finish this part time form concerned, I will basically give the presentation about my data.

20
00:04:05,490 --> 00:04:11,640
So physical activity data I collect that two years ago and to show you how

21
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:19,980
we could analyze this sort of digital features to understand as some of you,

22
00:04:20,460 --> 00:04:29,910
of course, my data is a little bit small, but anyway, I want to illustrate how we're going to go around to data, how we going to transform data,

23
00:04:29,910 --> 00:04:37,640
how we're in general view variables and so that we can understand some behaviors.

24
00:04:37,650 --> 00:04:47,389
And so I will talk about that Thursday I did this week I will start to talk a little bit about federation learning social.

25
00:04:47,390 --> 00:05:02,070
Supposedly we have like 50 something iPhones, so so we have a plan to share data, but we don't have this sort of agreement yet.

26
00:05:02,190 --> 00:05:10,320
So how we are going to share the data to run sort of statistic analysis, data analysis,

27
00:05:10,710 --> 00:05:18,780
which could be the case where, you know, Apple has sold all your billions,

28
00:05:18,780 --> 00:05:26,670
millions of devices, but Apple does not have the privilege agreement from you to use your data from,

29
00:05:27,300 --> 00:05:31,230
you know, you abroad not to be shared for any research purposes.

30
00:05:31,230 --> 00:05:37,020
But then Apple may have your agreement to share some of this summary stuff.

31
00:05:37,020 --> 00:05:42,899
It's like meeting standard deviation or like Fitbits or, you know, some of their, you know,

32
00:05:42,900 --> 00:05:51,479
your physical activities or some of these features collect by the little mobile devices,

33
00:05:51,480 --> 00:05:58,080
how we're included just, you know, data analysis results in the data sharing agreements.

34
00:05:58,440 --> 00:06:06,329
So I will cover they are finally learning so that we can have some practice.

35
00:06:06,330 --> 00:06:17,940
And when you have your data collected and before I actually collect your data and start to use your data,

36
00:06:20,040 --> 00:06:29,819
and so I ask you to play a little bit how you collect your video features of, you know, the use of how to use your mobile devices.

37
00:06:29,820 --> 00:06:39,460
I don't know if you have started to do that. I upload a template there in the canvas and let me know if you.

38
00:06:40,230 --> 00:06:44,960
Any problems or difficulty or something.

39
00:06:44,970 --> 00:06:49,270
Questions about that. Basically just there's my iPhone.

40
00:06:49,330 --> 00:06:55,880
I have a very old iPhone, but it's probably the iPhone X, but a few years ago.

41
00:06:55,890 --> 00:07:04,590
And so now you start this the setting and we have got let's see what other sort of mobile devices.

42
00:07:04,590 --> 00:07:13,049
But I just tell you, you know, where to find the data place on my iPhone.

43
00:07:13,050 --> 00:07:24,780
So you start with settings, then you go to the first front page very towards the end of this, the first page here you click screen time.

44
00:07:26,150 --> 00:07:33,350
Now you can start to see the data, right? So and you can see all the activities.

45
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:43,260
So we use the whole activities. Then there's a little histogram here that you can push this direction.

46
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:47,540
Then you can see all the historical data. Okay. So.

47
00:07:47,540 --> 00:07:50,900
So, of course, that the front page only shows the data today.

48
00:07:51,320 --> 00:07:54,170
But if you push this little histogram,

49
00:07:55,160 --> 00:08:07,459
then then you can start to see all the you can track all the historical data that record by the cycle about your screen use time and and and you know

50
00:08:07,460 --> 00:08:21,290
that you just recorded okay manually put into Excel sheet where the data will be later on used for all the projects to understand our behavior.

51
00:08:21,650 --> 00:08:25,370
So, so, so this is the way you do it.

52
00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:33,560
And different mobile devices may give you a different range of the sort of historical data for my information,

53
00:08:33,700 --> 00:08:36,950
that allows me to have the data of three weeks.

54
00:08:37,280 --> 00:08:46,010
So basically, I can track my data back to somewhere in the middle of December, but let me see what date I have.

55
00:08:46,700 --> 00:08:51,110
So that's December 2017. So roughly three weeks.

56
00:08:51,260 --> 00:08:58,520
So so this is the baseline data like before you heard from me that we are going to use data from projects.

57
00:08:58,940 --> 00:09:06,350
You had no preparation whatsoever pretending you are having a different behavior of using the iPhone,

58
00:09:07,940 --> 00:09:11,540
even though you heard from me that you probably would now change your behavior anyway.

59
00:09:12,740 --> 00:09:19,940
But that's the big baseline data, that sort of unconditional anything of this course,

60
00:09:20,180 --> 00:09:27,710
any anything related to this sort of planning of doing use the data for the project that.

61
00:09:28,070 --> 00:09:36,220
So this is very natural sort of behavior that you would like to record of, you know,

62
00:09:36,290 --> 00:09:43,520
that is not you anyway related to this course or some planning of use the data for project.

63
00:09:43,850 --> 00:09:48,440
You may have some psychological chance when you are aware of that.

64
00:09:49,250 --> 00:09:56,659
Data will be used for some project or will be shared with your peers and or your teammates or something like that.

65
00:09:56,660 --> 00:10:05,870
But you won't track back and to. I know that some of you did not turn all this function and you please turn around now and you start to record.

66
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:12,620
I mean, this is a very interesting recent data problem. Later on, we want to see how do you deal with this missing data problem?

67
00:10:13,010 --> 00:10:17,840
I mean, this is, you know, very practical situation that, you know,

68
00:10:18,050 --> 00:10:26,300
you are not able to collect some baseline data and how do you compute or come up with baseline data?

69
00:10:26,930 --> 00:10:37,030
And so use transport, learning or some techniques that somehow help you to, you know, create some baseline for,

70
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:42,790
you know, we're doing data analysis this some different type of, you know, baseline data.

71
00:10:42,830 --> 00:10:51,860
So, so, so something I want to you, you know, see in practice, you have a perfect plan of data collection, as I just described.

72
00:10:52,670 --> 00:10:56,809
But in reality, you do have different little issues here, there.

73
00:10:56,810 --> 00:11:08,450
And the data collection and those little things may not be actually sort of a given you in the textbooks.

74
00:11:08,450 --> 00:11:10,890
We have to go really, you know,

75
00:11:10,910 --> 00:11:20,899
practical project and we have to go actually go through the procedure over which you will see the actually those things here,

76
00:11:20,900 --> 00:11:29,010
there and everything could be ad hoc in some sense that we are trying to find ways to, you know, you know,

77
00:11:29,750 --> 00:11:43,070
amend your plan or find a way to make your data somewhat normalized and to be compatible this entire sort of data collection plan.

78
00:11:43,080 --> 00:11:49,100
So, so let me know if you have any issues or issues the better, because that means we're more valuable,

79
00:11:49,880 --> 00:11:54,950
you know, we more useful and we're more likely to get a good, decent job, right?

80
00:11:54,950 --> 00:12:00,320
So because that's how we're going to help people in practice to solve practical problems.

81
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:03,800
If data is perfect, nobody will need that right.

82
00:12:03,860 --> 00:12:07,459
We need all of the issues here, there.

83
00:12:07,460 --> 00:12:13,100
And then we will see what are the principles we need in order to deal with those issues.

84
00:12:13,160 --> 00:12:19,820
Right. So in the data, we begin with data collection and over the course that we will learn how to deal this.

85
00:12:20,180 --> 00:12:23,780
You know, data analysis with data are not perfect.

86
00:12:23,870 --> 00:12:31,210
All right. Let's now look. You know, completely sort of collected completely from the the plant.

87
00:12:31,290 --> 00:12:36,230
Right. So there are always some deviations from your plant data collection.

88
00:12:37,130 --> 00:12:48,140
But anyway. Well, we'll start with this informed consent so that we can start to see issues when you go to collect the data and share your story.

89
00:12:49,190 --> 00:12:57,679
And then we will look at sort of this course that what are the things that we like to discuss?

90
00:12:57,680 --> 00:13:10,549
And of course it's a little bit flexible and we wanna have some hands on training, not just go through with X plus Y equal to Z,

91
00:13:10,550 --> 00:13:22,070
sort of standard formula like you have the were or you know, normal distribution and we will do something according to the features of our data.

92
00:13:22,360 --> 00:13:27,110
Okay. This is something I want to teach you about how we're going to look at data.

93
00:13:27,110 --> 00:13:36,739
How common is it, right? Statistical method and techniques of data analytics that would deal with different types of situations.

94
00:13:36,740 --> 00:13:40,720
Okay. So that's really something like, you know,

95
00:13:40,780 --> 00:13:48,710
while at some sort of adjustment or modification of the course according to the issues arising from your experience.

96
00:13:49,130 --> 00:13:54,440
Okay. So that's why data is the first thing we have to have, right?

97
00:13:54,470 --> 00:14:03,020
So, so that we will start with inference concerned that we will start to see how

98
00:14:03,020 --> 00:14:08,410
we're going to get data and how what the issues around this data collection.

99
00:14:11,030 --> 00:14:16,380
So. Good life is.

100
00:14:18,150 --> 00:14:22,620
So you can see it better. Okay.

101
00:14:22,620 --> 00:14:31,120
So of course that will you this informed consent form is actually given to the district.

102
00:14:31,710 --> 00:14:39,240
Is that correct? So so you have to really start with the information about this study, right?

103
00:14:39,260 --> 00:14:48,810
So what is studies about. So you can give like study, title or study or whatever.

104
00:14:48,960 --> 00:14:59,730
Basically, you give a description about the about the project or study because this title will be used as some of our right.

105
00:14:59,740 --> 00:15:12,270
So, you know, this is a a organization that will approve the study and it starts h u m or something like that.

106
00:15:12,270 --> 00:15:18,600
If the study involves human, human being, then the animals that there has to be approved by RB.

107
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:26,220
And this title is essential to, you know, be a reference when you submit to your.

108
00:15:26,550 --> 00:15:29,950
So it's a protocol to IRB approval.

109
00:15:29,970 --> 00:15:41,100
Okay. So, so our project title is understand be here para uses screening at screen use activities that measure five mobile devices.

110
00:15:41,130 --> 00:15:44,390
Okay. So that's basically the project.

111
00:15:45,300 --> 00:15:50,100
Okay. So the how you define the person now involved in the study.

112
00:15:50,100 --> 00:16:02,850
And so of course, I'm the PI. I will be responsible for all the operations and the other know policy issues and regulations around

113
00:16:02,850 --> 00:16:11,309
this study and make sure that implementation and everything will be under control under my reasoning.

114
00:16:11,310 --> 00:16:20,640
So the principal investigator is very important to be mentioned because this is the person who is going to be responsible for the study

115
00:16:21,210 --> 00:16:31,250
that we have co-investigators forcing this course of will be all student enrolled in I'll step six 2022 is through the semester.

116
00:16:31,260 --> 00:16:38,850
You are all co-investigators because you are going to analyze the data and so you will be regarded as co-investigators.

117
00:16:39,750 --> 00:16:48,870
So at a time of preparedness, informed consent, I was not so sure if GSI will be allocated to this course,

118
00:16:48,870 --> 00:16:57,299
and it seems that it very likely we will have the GSI because we already have over 50 at the moment.

119
00:16:57,300 --> 00:17:05,070
So I will I will add the GI slide, the name of GSI, whoever it would be as a co-investigator.

120
00:17:05,070 --> 00:17:08,520
So that's the event that I'm going to do it.

121
00:17:09,360 --> 00:17:16,860
But I just inform you that this is the research team that we're going to have for this project.

122
00:17:18,060 --> 00:17:25,770
Okay. So now you're writing a message to the potential participant of this study, right?

123
00:17:26,190 --> 00:17:32,380
So we're inviting you to participate in the research. Study participation is completely voluntary.

124
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:38,490
Okay. So that, you know, you have to really state that this is the nature of this study.

125
00:17:38,760 --> 00:17:48,329
What we did, our initial participation, if you are free to participate now, you can always change your mind later.

126
00:17:48,330 --> 00:17:54,450
So people have freedom to, you know, be strong for the study if they are waiting to do something.

127
00:17:55,020 --> 00:18:03,659
Okay. So there are no negative consequences of the pulse nor no course performance evaluation.

128
00:18:03,660 --> 00:18:12,930
So if you decide not to participate in this study, I will give you a different dataset to contribute to the project.

129
00:18:12,930 --> 00:18:14,430
I wish you are not going to do that,

130
00:18:14,430 --> 00:18:24,800
but I'm just saying that this is completely voluntary and so that there are no negative consequences for you if you decide not to participate study.

131
00:18:24,840 --> 00:18:31,290
And so the no negative consequences on your of course, performance evaluation, whatever you decide.

132
00:18:31,920 --> 00:18:40,139
So that's basically a very important message that you write in the very beginning to define

133
00:18:40,140 --> 00:18:46,290
the nature of participation and the consequences of participating or not participating.

134
00:18:46,800 --> 00:18:52,230
Okay. So if you participate the study, there is no negative consequences on your health.

135
00:18:52,500 --> 00:18:59,909
Okay. So there, so, so, so if you will not participate in this, then there are no consequences of your course performance.

136
00:18:59,910 --> 00:19:03,960
So but anyway, so this is the message you write in the front.

137
00:19:04,170 --> 00:19:06,479
You can modify this statement,

138
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:14,100
but overall you define the nature of the participation and consequences participating or not participating in this study.

139
00:19:14,100 --> 00:19:19,730
Okay. So that's important so that you. Inform the participant.

140
00:19:20,150 --> 00:19:23,450
The purpose of this study. Okay, so.

141
00:19:23,450 --> 00:19:30,610
So why you want to, you know, design instead of why you want to collect data from you participants.

142
00:19:30,710 --> 00:19:36,950
Right. So, so that, you know, you give them the purpose so they can understand they have to, you know,

143
00:19:37,400 --> 00:19:47,250
motivate them understanding of or cooperation where we were passively participation because later on in the study there are always issue or retention.

144
00:19:47,270 --> 00:19:51,470
I So some people say, oh, I'm tired of this. I don't want to come.

145
00:19:51,680 --> 00:19:57,640
I'm very bothered by the phone calls every week to, you know, answer questions and so on.

146
00:19:57,680 --> 00:20:06,320
I'm so bothered. I don't wanna participate. But if you give them a very clear statement of significance and importance of this study,

147
00:20:06,950 --> 00:20:11,540
that may probably give them a better motivation to stay in the study.

148
00:20:11,540 --> 00:20:18,530
Right? So that you have easier situation to retain participants in the study over the course of study.

149
00:20:19,730 --> 00:20:23,890
Of course, our study is short because we only have one semester, right?

150
00:20:23,930 --> 00:20:25,240
So by about three months.

151
00:20:25,250 --> 00:20:33,559
And for some study that, you know, lasts for two years or even longer, like Alzheimer disease, you have to follow patients years, years.

152
00:20:33,560 --> 00:20:41,600
You want to see their, you know, cognitive function, the evolution or, you know, profiles.

153
00:20:42,170 --> 00:20:45,720
You really want to motivate them to stay in the study, right?

154
00:20:45,770 --> 00:20:53,780
So or something like that. So for some longitudinal studies where that takes a long time, okay,

155
00:20:53,910 --> 00:21:05,870
then you certainly need to find ways to recruit participants and to have a good retention plan there too.

156
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:19,340
So we aim at studying individual behaviors, using mobile devices or handheld handheld computers such as smartphones, butlers,

157
00:21:19,340 --> 00:21:28,190
and has a wearable computer like iWatch that measures screen use activities, for example, screen time and number of pickups.

158
00:21:28,550 --> 00:21:34,190
One kind of interest is the amount of time spent on social media apps.

159
00:21:34,700 --> 00:21:41,320
This study is to assess if the behavior such addiction of mobile device use but

160
00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:47,510
may change when a certain intervention is introduced to reduce reduce activity.

161
00:21:47,930 --> 00:21:56,290
As I say that there is a plan later when we maybe after the midterm, we will start to design a patient.

162
00:21:57,380 --> 00:21:57,740
Okay.

163
00:21:58,130 --> 00:22:11,030
And then we will implement the interim implementation, because after the third learning, I will start to talk about study, design, randomization,

164
00:22:11,840 --> 00:22:15,970
and so that we will in this course will, will, you know,

165
00:22:16,700 --> 00:22:27,980
hypothetically create that intervention and go through the process how we're going to implement intervention as you know it,

166
00:22:28,490 --> 00:22:32,240
hopefully to reduce this reduce activities,

167
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:44,750
then we will analyze the data Pre-post Pre-post intervention and see if there is any change of the screen use behaviors so

168
00:22:44,750 --> 00:22:52,020
information collected by mobile device and can help learn and improve understand either patterns on the use of electronic devices.

169
00:22:52,040 --> 00:22:55,670
Okay. So this is actually the purpose of this study.

170
00:22:58,580 --> 00:23:01,910
Okay. So that's what we I do.

171
00:23:03,940 --> 00:23:11,660
So so basically I already gave you a self 2016 connected device use guidelines.

172
00:23:11,930 --> 00:23:17,960
According to my computer some and I just said I just told you a little bit okay

173
00:23:18,380 --> 00:23:25,340
how you pick up your device and open the settings and look at screen time.

174
00:23:25,340 --> 00:23:33,470
And I gave a little bit like one minute 20, but in reality you probably will see a little bit more.

175
00:23:33,480 --> 00:23:42,080
And so when you have several years that you like to collect data from a patient,

176
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:49,639
you use questionnaires to collect data from patients that probably need to tell the patient some, some languages.

177
00:23:49,640 --> 00:23:55,430
And if you're not here for some internal global health studies where questionnaires

178
00:23:55,430 --> 00:23:59,570
are in different languages like Spanish or French or something like that,

179
00:23:59,930 --> 00:24:05,329
you have to give people a little bit training for some understanding because some of

180
00:24:05,330 --> 00:24:11,569
the questionnaires are translated from English version to a foreign language version,

181
00:24:11,570 --> 00:24:25,700
and then you need to do the training. And anyway, so, so this 20 is very study and variable sort of depends on what things you make.

182
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:33,139
Florida's study is very simple focus. You know, I already told you where to find the information, how you record it.

183
00:24:33,140 --> 00:24:42,230
I upload the template. I sent your a email to tell you that the structure of the data table that we need to

184
00:24:42,230 --> 00:24:47,660
fill in and and tell you that we're going to use the data for some of the studies.

185
00:24:48,170 --> 00:24:55,670
Okay. So as I said, you you know,

186
00:24:57,080 --> 00:25:01,819
we will you don't you'll just keep the normal use of the mobile device during

187
00:25:01,820 --> 00:25:07,070
the winter semester personal interruption and do not turn the iPhone off.

188
00:25:07,550 --> 00:25:11,150
And so you say, I'm not going to use my phone for three days.

189
00:25:11,660 --> 00:25:19,100
Okay, so so that's fine. But this, you know, you don't need to do this because of this study, right?

190
00:25:19,100 --> 00:25:23,570
I'm just bigger decision as to where you decide.

191
00:25:23,630 --> 00:25:29,960
Okay. Okay. We need to collect the baseline data prior to internal winter semester.

192
00:25:30,050 --> 00:25:32,630
Okay. That's exactly what I told you in the beginning.

193
00:25:33,770 --> 00:25:41,840
So so if you like, because behaviors are I mean, additional features from mobile device must be a social of some major,

194
00:25:42,350 --> 00:25:46,399
you know, activities like during Christmas time, right?

195
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:52,309
So like Christmas Day, you probably use a lot of, you know,

196
00:25:52,310 --> 00:25:59,690
the photos because you want take photos to record some special moments that you want to share your photos.

197
00:26:00,020 --> 00:26:08,510
These are your friends or family members and probably that photo app is more frequently used or something like that.

198
00:26:09,080 --> 00:26:21,590
If you have some, you know, major activities, for example, you fly from New York to San Francisco, you know, during the New Year holiday break.

199
00:26:21,590 --> 00:26:24,920
Of course, every plan, usually Atari a full now.

200
00:26:25,340 --> 00:26:36,740
So you don't have any activity in that time at some major activities you think that will be somewhat related to your behaviors.

201
00:26:37,070 --> 00:26:40,940
You can make a diary or you can you'll write something down.

202
00:26:42,110 --> 00:26:45,650
This is something like you can use for interpretation later.

203
00:26:46,100 --> 00:26:56,420
Why I have this very, you know, a different behavior, you know, so you can understand that for the purpose of interpretation.

204
00:26:56,510 --> 00:27:00,430
Okay. So so that's something, you know,

205
00:27:00,440 --> 00:27:07,770
you write I wrote about major activity during study period that may alter normal use devices if

206
00:27:07,820 --> 00:27:17,690
and okay so that's something like you want to write it and to to be used for interpretation.

207
00:27:18,500 --> 00:27:26,569
So of course that's that this is very important table that usually we put in the of informed concerns basically defines

208
00:27:26,570 --> 00:27:34,430
the possible risk people always say you know what at risk I'm going to face right will I participate to study this?

209
00:27:35,690 --> 00:27:41,690
So there are there are, you know, several aspects about the risk that you need to really describe you.

210
00:27:41,750 --> 00:27:53,890
The informed concern first. First there is follow hazard device because we do use of device whether or not the device is you know, has hazards.

211
00:27:54,020 --> 00:27:57,320
Okay so hazard from device and so.

212
00:27:58,080 --> 00:28:03,840
On mobile devices, a component industry standards will not cause harm to users.

213
00:28:04,400 --> 00:28:10,770
But that's certainly, of course, that if you use ultrasound, you use, you know,

214
00:28:10,770 --> 00:28:22,860
the some imaging scan or other sort of devices in the data collection, then this is not as simple as I describe here.

215
00:28:22,860 --> 00:28:38,700
It must be some other sort of sort of a types of risk that you need to really inform, participate if you were going to take your to, you know, MRI.

216
00:28:38,700 --> 00:28:49,139
And here's the risk. Right. So, you know, so so you have to do that to describe the risk of, you know, for the use of device for data collection.

217
00:28:49,140 --> 00:28:52,530
So so so that's for us. We use mobile phones.

218
00:28:52,530 --> 00:29:04,200
It's very meaningful. And and also, of course, this company, the issue I mean, people always concerned about the data privacy, data confidentiality.

219
00:29:05,460 --> 00:29:14,580
So so the breach of reality is really a information the risk and information leak.

220
00:29:15,840 --> 00:29:25,980
So so you need to describe how you're going to manage data and how you kind of you can try your best to protect the data privacy.

221
00:29:26,490 --> 00:29:34,970
So all identifying information is removed and replaced by a randomly generated study I.D. when it's a useful knowledge.

222
00:29:34,980 --> 00:29:46,530
So, so, so people cannot look at the data to identify this so that that that that's something like will be de-identified.

223
00:29:46,830 --> 00:30:02,820
So people can, you know, have all the sort of personal information in the data to identify to leak to individual what was stored the

224
00:30:03,450 --> 00:30:13,410
and transfer all the electronic data on a password protected encrypted computer using primary to outbox.

225
00:30:16,140 --> 00:30:21,900
So we will, of course, define how that data will be shared.

226
00:30:22,050 --> 00:30:33,790
Okay. So so we will use this we use lockbox as the primary sort of platform on which we are going to share it.

227
00:30:34,170 --> 00:30:42,210
Okay. And when we have to use, I will discuss this and decide how we're going to implement this,

228
00:30:42,840 --> 00:30:50,290
you know, from the ability making sure that the data will be will not go outside of the classroom.

229
00:30:50,430 --> 00:31:01,719
So. So if we have any paper data like this, you form concern form because you go to sign it,

230
00:31:01,720 --> 00:31:09,820
give it to me and I will put it in the locked cabinet in my office.

231
00:31:09,820 --> 00:31:18,160
Locked. Okay. So nobody will really have the chance to access this information except me.

232
00:31:18,500 --> 00:31:25,600
Okay, so. So of course, the other information that I have to make sure that they are securely stored.

233
00:31:27,130 --> 00:31:31,420
You know, without permission, nobody can access to the API.

234
00:31:31,830 --> 00:31:37,150
Okay. So that's really the to operate, basically.

235
00:31:37,360 --> 00:31:42,850
So the operation that we are going to implement to protect the data privacy.

236
00:31:47,320 --> 00:31:49,090
So there is a risk that you experience.

237
00:31:49,090 --> 00:31:56,230
Anytime you provide information online, use a secure system to collect this data, but you can now completely eliminate risk.

238
00:31:56,590 --> 00:32:06,430
For example, you know, the if you uploads your your data from your personal computer to Dropbox,

239
00:32:06,970 --> 00:32:12,280
maybe there is a hacker coming to hack the system, which is very, very unlikely.

240
00:32:12,310 --> 00:32:15,190
Very, very, very, very, very, very unlikely.

241
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:26,139
But I mean, we have to define this risk, you know, so so the way that, you know, people understand there are some very,

242
00:32:26,140 --> 00:32:33,880
very minimal risk, their way of doing this data sort of upload uploading or something like that.

243
00:32:34,280 --> 00:32:48,099
Okay. So so those are at the same site from device, from data, from sort of data transfer or data sort of of movement from one place to another.

244
00:32:48,100 --> 00:32:56,049
So those are things that we have to define actually in the informed consent so that

245
00:32:56,050 --> 00:33:01,660
participants have their understanding about the potential risk with the participants.

246
00:33:01,660 --> 00:33:07,210
Then for that, the the other information.

247
00:33:07,990 --> 00:33:15,880
So typically when people participate study, you want to give them a little incentive for their to appreciate their participation.

248
00:33:17,020 --> 00:33:22,060
Typically, people can give them a little like gift, the cars and so forth.

249
00:33:22,270 --> 00:33:26,470
Here we do not because I don't have budget to give you like $50.

250
00:33:26,680 --> 00:33:30,130
I don't give a car $0.

251
00:33:30,140 --> 00:33:36,879
I'm sorry, but I just put that item. There is really something that people would do in practice.

252
00:33:36,880 --> 00:33:43,960
Give that like $50 gift card to a person there for each visit.

253
00:33:44,050 --> 00:33:53,379
Right? So at a time I've heard this in concert, we only have 47, but now we have over 50.

254
00:33:53,380 --> 00:34:05,020
So, so this number will be revised and that this is the number of participants that, you know, we did not do sample size calculation.

255
00:34:05,020 --> 00:34:14,460
We did not do power calculation. You practice you, you know, if you help someone to design study the, you know,

256
00:34:14,470 --> 00:34:26,440
one number they need to put this sort of informed concert is how many participants that this study is required in order to empower the actual study.

257
00:34:26,440 --> 00:34:34,059
Right. There is a sample size calculation will power analysis that would determine the number of participants.

258
00:34:34,060 --> 00:34:39,250
Right. So but here we're just meaning actual practice.

259
00:34:39,250 --> 00:34:45,280
And suppose that we already use a power calculator or a sample size calculator.

260
00:34:45,320 --> 00:34:49,629
We come up with a sample size well, which is actually the entire cost.

261
00:34:49,630 --> 00:35:00,280
Right. So, so basically in practice, this number will be determined by the sample size calculator according to the design of the study.

262
00:35:03,240 --> 00:35:12,740
So participants vs no reason no compliance will be removed from the study.

263
00:35:12,750 --> 00:35:20,790
So basically the people would, you know, do not want to participate a study that will will not, you know.

264
00:35:22,500 --> 00:35:32,110
Have them, and I will do this sort of recruitment to replace sort of strategy in practice.

265
00:35:32,130 --> 00:35:41,310
If you design a study like it's this study requires 50 participants but only, you know,

266
00:35:42,240 --> 00:35:50,700
you go to a database like Universe Michigan Hospital database to find individuals, you know, diabetes, for example.

267
00:35:51,090 --> 00:35:56,250
And then you want you aim to recruit 50 patients that you now you know,

268
00:35:56,490 --> 00:36:04,590
you're Oscar Peterson I do one of you participate that if I said no then I problem so so somehow

269
00:36:04,590 --> 00:36:11,999
you need to you know if I if I cannot have my commitment worth compliance to the study,

270
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:19,470
I will not be included. Even I was asked by, you know, the project manager,

271
00:36:20,010 --> 00:36:26,970
my willingness to participate if I'm not going to do this and it will go to the next person in the recruitment.

272
00:36:29,960 --> 00:36:34,530
So full question about the research you can ask me and GSI.

273
00:36:34,530 --> 00:36:40,100
I was at its side and of course, for complaints and problems.

274
00:36:40,790 --> 00:36:50,780
And typically that in practice, you provide full numbers and email address and to each you use listed here.

275
00:36:51,380 --> 00:37:00,260
So so that when you have any questions or complaints problems that you can reach out.

276
00:37:01,430 --> 00:37:12,910
So no thanks. The before you sign this, there will be some simple questions, then you need to check and then, you know,

277
00:37:13,190 --> 00:37:21,380
this is basically the place where you start to shoot you off Greenland or you willingness to put these to be study.

278
00:37:22,270 --> 00:37:22,500
Okay.

279
00:37:22,580 --> 00:37:34,399
So those are very standard sort of statements, but those statements are very critical because it is, as you know, designed for this informed consent.

280
00:37:34,400 --> 00:37:37,100
So I confirm the questioning that come from I have read,

281
00:37:37,100 --> 00:37:42,710
understand about information about the study as that opportunity to consider this information,

282
00:37:43,220 --> 00:37:49,160
ask questions and have any answers have had some sort of satisfactory.

283
00:37:49,760 --> 00:37:52,219
Satisfactory. So that's the first one.

284
00:37:52,220 --> 00:38:00,140
Basically, you have to, you know, make sure that they read, understand and have the opportunity to ask any questions.

285
00:38:02,420 --> 00:38:06,680
Okay. So that's something, you know, you have to do that.

286
00:38:07,970 --> 00:38:17,330
I understand that my participation is voluntary and I am free to throw in any time without giving any reason.

287
00:38:17,480 --> 00:38:23,330
There's no power of guilt and you can't. So you have the freedom to stop participating.

288
00:38:24,230 --> 00:38:30,140
So there is no penalty. So you face the withdrawal from the study.

289
00:38:30,520 --> 00:38:36,349
Okay, that's for understanding. Understand the relevant section.

290
00:38:36,350 --> 00:38:44,830
So my data collects during the study. Maybe look at that by the researcher from the research team in the class.

291
00:38:44,840 --> 00:38:50,540
Well, that's the University of Michigan where it is relevant to my taking part in this research.

292
00:38:50,810 --> 00:38:56,480
I give permission to this research to have access to my records in a fully d850 form.

293
00:38:56,810 --> 00:39:01,040
So this is essentially about the scope of data.

294
00:39:01,820 --> 00:39:05,360
Maybe that will be that may be used for the study.

295
00:39:05,390 --> 00:39:14,570
So you give them the permissions to allow us to share the data, to analyze the data.

296
00:39:14,750 --> 00:39:19,550
Okay. So first last lastly, you agreed to participate of our study.

297
00:39:19,850 --> 00:39:24,770
Okay. Now you signed this and you know the data and give the signature.

298
00:39:26,600 --> 00:39:31,250
Okay. So, you know, sometimes that for, you know,

299
00:39:31,520 --> 00:39:42,410
people like in Alzheimer disease or in schizophrenic patients that they they may not be able to do the sign but solve.

300
00:39:43,070 --> 00:39:49,580
And then you can have a person taking the consent.

301
00:39:49,940 --> 00:39:56,780
You have to sign it. So anyway, so that's something that, you know,

302
00:39:56,780 --> 00:40:04,339
this is the very standard structure of this of the informed consent so that you

303
00:40:04,340 --> 00:40:10,010
understand this and we need to collect it for in order to collect the data for that.

304
00:40:11,360 --> 00:40:19,129
But of course, that later Apple will study how to design interventions that can be implemented,

305
00:40:19,130 --> 00:40:25,480
of course, and that will see how we analyze proposed source data.

306
00:40:25,490 --> 00:40:33,630
And, you know, maybe the integration is now is not going to be effective, but we go through this process and step by step.

307
00:40:33,650 --> 00:40:41,720
So as I said, that data quality is very important to the best way to make sure make make sure,

308
00:40:42,650 --> 00:40:48,470
you know, to ensure the good high quality data is using these online.

309
00:40:48,920 --> 00:41:00,860
You sort of have very thoughtful plans in advance how they are going to be collected, how data will be, you know, cleaned, and how data will be.

310
00:41:00,860 --> 00:41:09,770
And so so you have a plan to collect relevant data, not a random, complete purposeless data.

311
00:41:09,980 --> 00:41:19,180
So you want to have relevant data collected and to answer specific questions, to study for specific sort of objectives,

312
00:41:19,190 --> 00:41:28,370
you like to say, okay, so that's something I want to teach you in the course and so you can learn this.

313
00:41:28,610 --> 00:41:40,310
And so a couple of my students who graduated from the department joined Google, and one of them is actually doing some design.

314
00:41:40,490 --> 00:41:45,860
Right. So, so, so if you open up Google, right?

315
00:41:45,860 --> 00:41:49,270
So works there.

316
00:41:51,920 --> 00:41:57,880
Just one. Both.

317
00:42:07,340 --> 00:42:12,000
Okay. Okay, I see. That's.

318
00:42:25,100 --> 00:42:30,830
So so we open up Google. Typically, you could have a little sort of little things here.

319
00:42:31,370 --> 00:42:34,720
So, so but for this page, we don't see that.

320
00:42:34,790 --> 00:42:44,270
But anyway, so typically you will see something maybe replace of this logo or some interesting things there.

321
00:42:45,020 --> 00:42:56,270
And then. The Google Company basically received millions, millions of submissions to replace this logo, for example,

322
00:42:56,270 --> 00:43:05,470
for special day, maybe Martin Luther King Day, that they have very special logo to replace the regular generic one.

323
00:43:06,110 --> 00:43:24,170
So the typical receive many sort of submissions ideas how this can be used and so so they will do some design study among 20 plans or 20 logos.

324
00:43:24,350 --> 00:43:28,660
Which one would you use? So they will function okay.

325
00:43:29,120 --> 00:43:33,140
And then they will collect data and analyze and make a decision.

326
00:43:34,070 --> 00:43:38,170
So which one to use. Okay. This is very simple experiment, actually.

327
00:43:40,100 --> 00:43:40,940
And of course,

328
00:43:40,940 --> 00:43:53,089
they have ordered like a B test or something like that to test some of the policies or business strategies that they can use to promote your goal.

329
00:43:53,090 --> 00:43:57,020
And so so something like that. So the.

330
00:43:59,770 --> 00:44:06,590
In practice. You do? Even in this.

331
00:44:11,280 --> 00:44:25,480
All of the dot com companies that they also do some experiments to build up some recommendation system to build up some to make some decisions,

332
00:44:26,230 --> 00:44:35,730
some business decision. But here we basically look at, you know, clinical decisions or a public health intervention sort of.

333
00:44:36,370 --> 00:44:42,360
So. So but and the ball's in line to always be certain, you know,

334
00:44:42,670 --> 00:44:49,300
treatment or intervention that you decide you like to evaluate the efficacy of that

335
00:44:49,690 --> 00:44:54,250
treatment or intervention and make a decision will make a recommendation or something.

336
00:44:57,610 --> 00:45:03,970
So what I want to do next is really just show you my data.

337
00:45:03,980 --> 00:45:11,530
I collect it. And for people who do not come to the class today,

338
00:45:11,530 --> 00:45:26,440
I will create a assignment sort of option so people can submit their informed consent through their science.

339
00:45:29,270 --> 00:45:32,150
Well. So here is the data I have. Okay.

340
00:45:32,900 --> 00:45:47,330
So basically 2021 in winter semester, we start the new semester, winter semester after Dr. Lucy King's Day, and that was a Tuesday.

341
00:45:48,140 --> 00:45:54,350
So because we're not that time, we just start to have vaccination.

342
00:45:54,800 --> 00:46:02,090
So December, remember December 2020, like middle December 2020, that was the time that I heard.

343
00:46:02,090 --> 00:46:10,819
It's great news. So the two companies us start to offer vaccines for COVID 19.

344
00:46:10,820 --> 00:46:19,790
So as that winter semester 2021, we started in winter semester like two weeks after the new year.

345
00:46:19,820 --> 00:46:24,760
So somewhere I think 17 or 16, I don't remember exactly which date.

346
00:46:25,100 --> 00:46:30,740
So I was able to track my data back using whatever I just described.

347
00:46:31,280 --> 00:46:36,050
So here is my data from basically four months of January.

348
00:46:36,230 --> 00:46:43,850
So from January 3rd up to 27 is, you know, almost data for one month.

349
00:46:44,210 --> 00:46:48,860
So I. Record in my data.

350
00:46:49,310 --> 00:46:54,440
This data is available on campus, so full screen time, she said.

351
00:46:54,860 --> 00:46:59,360
So I use from the same device. I am still having this.

352
00:47:02,120 --> 00:47:08,930
So this is sort of the numbers I read directly from the from my iPhone.

353
00:47:09,560 --> 00:47:13,700
I entered the data manually. I'm glad I covered this in 2 minutes.

354
00:47:14,690 --> 00:47:21,650
Just a higher calculation in my mind. Or you can use a calculator, whatever you want.

355
00:47:21,980 --> 00:47:29,350
3 hours is 128 minutes.

356
00:47:29,630 --> 00:47:33,560
So we want to use the unit minutes.

357
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:47,890
Okay. So so if you use hours, then you need to later on convert to that unit of minutes if you were to harmonize data across different studies.

358
00:47:47,900 --> 00:48:04,250
But I, I suggest that everybody use unit minutes to transform, transform this sort of the, this train, this train type of data into data.

359
00:48:04,820 --> 00:48:13,250
So there are two same but just different force. Right. And of course, that that this is good because you will make sure that to your data,

360
00:48:13,250 --> 00:48:18,770
you will minimize your data in error because you have the same information equally twice.

361
00:48:19,220 --> 00:48:20,750
You are in different form.

362
00:48:20,750 --> 00:48:31,110
Step this this to call it should give you exactly the same information if there is a discrepancy that you immediately identify arrow in the data.

363
00:48:31,580 --> 00:48:42,470
Right so so this trick of double entrance in different form I but it's good trick to minimize the error.

364
00:48:42,560 --> 00:48:57,080
So that's I use this to call in dummy and is the total screen time on the social apps okay and total number of pick ups daily.

365
00:48:57,560 --> 00:49:01,390
Total number of pick ups and then the first pickup time.

366
00:49:02,600 --> 00:49:05,690
So this is the data I have.

367
00:49:06,050 --> 00:49:15,260
So now what I want you to do is really just follow the same format, enter your data, and then we're going to analyze it.

368
00:49:15,440 --> 00:49:19,900
Okay. Okay.

369
00:49:20,130 --> 00:49:32,650
So I have a data analysis report I'd like to share with you about my somewhat secret myself like 2021.

370
00:49:32,670 --> 00:49:39,480
So this. So.

371
00:49:40,260 --> 00:49:44,280
So this is analysis I did for my.

372
00:49:45,180 --> 00:49:59,470
Okay. You can see to learn my behaviors for that January 2021 and see how I use my iPhone and how much time is spent on my like, social apps or what.

373
00:49:59,640 --> 00:50:03,510
Well, it's the it's the first pick up time and so on and so forth.

374
00:50:03,660 --> 00:50:08,730
And so analysis, swing activity, data from mobile devices.

375
00:50:08,740 --> 00:50:12,120
So that's the one. Okay.

376
00:50:12,630 --> 00:50:23,459
So this kind of I intend to illustrate a detailed analysis of Peterson's screen activity time clock during January 3rd to 27th, 2020,

377
00:50:23,460 --> 00:50:33,540
including two variables daily, total screen time, daily, total screen time on social apps, daily number of pickups and first time day.

378
00:50:34,110 --> 00:50:40,380
So those are the digital features, the data that generate by automatic by your iPhone.

379
00:50:40,620 --> 00:50:45,660
Okay, so the data is available in the Cabinet's course Web page.

380
00:50:47,940 --> 00:50:51,380
So part one, let's talk about that data collection. Okay.

381
00:50:52,140 --> 00:50:57,090
So screen activity, you'll see this. And I was collected by Optus on during the period of January.

382
00:50:57,100 --> 00:51:02,580
Oh, this is high point to be on January 3rd.

383
00:51:03,630 --> 00:51:13,320
I just do not provide some due to the features of screen use behaviors useful to track personal activity related to addiction to mobile devices.

384
00:51:13,950 --> 00:51:22,170
Okay. So, so you want to see how much time I spend on my, my mobile device.

385
00:51:22,230 --> 00:51:31,510
And so if I have any issues addiction to my device, refer to the full dataset available with cameras.

386
00:51:32,730 --> 00:51:40,080
So the first thing, of course, in the anything analysis will be what is the promise of this study?

387
00:51:40,750 --> 00:51:47,040
You know, if you want to use the data for analysis, then what is the promise?

388
00:51:47,250 --> 00:51:50,459
Right? The premise of this study,

389
00:51:50,460 --> 00:51:59,820
and that's the first thing you will start because you have to define the direction or some kind of the scope related to actually your data.

390
00:52:00,380 --> 00:52:03,630
So you can do many, many different ways.

391
00:52:04,020 --> 00:52:09,640
You can have many different ways to analyze the data. But what is the your focus, the data?

392
00:52:09,660 --> 00:52:17,610
And so you have to give this sort of the primary sort of focus what the premise of this study.

393
00:52:17,640 --> 00:52:27,060
Right. So there is a vast literature on the negative effects of excessive screen time usage as part of addiction to mobile devices,

394
00:52:27,060 --> 00:52:34,860
including lower lower physiological loading and adverse to physical conditions such as obesity.

395
00:52:35,220 --> 00:52:40,230
Right. So so you've you basically put some references.

396
00:52:40,230 --> 00:52:44,820
I mean, this is no, we're not the first time this.

397
00:52:48,620 --> 00:52:55,100
Whether or not that if the first time to study this kind of data people have studied this.

398
00:52:55,370 --> 00:53:06,859
So so this one Journal of Pediatrics which is a very respected journal that study how the House rated quality of life lifestyle behavior class their

399
00:53:06,860 --> 00:53:19,460
social age countries where they use the digital things and picked up and also you know this paper emotion and this study the you know adolescence how,

400
00:53:20,030 --> 00:53:24,860
you know, there are fewer decrease in physiological well-being.

401
00:53:26,030 --> 00:53:30,889
You'll be linked to screen time during the rise of smartphone technology.

402
00:53:30,890 --> 00:53:41,540
And so and also, you know, those are there are more and more quite a number of quite large number of study and have been there and to you know.

403
00:53:43,430 --> 00:53:50,900
Look at ads to utilize the digital features to study some well-being, some house issues.

404
00:53:53,270 --> 00:54:02,000
So in addition, association between treatable procrastination and mobile device addiction was reported among Chinese college students.

405
00:54:02,400 --> 00:54:04,070
Okay, here's the third reference.

406
00:54:04,970 --> 00:54:19,129
You know, the linkage or the association between procrastination, you know, the interest cancellation rate, so, so on and mobile device use.

407
00:54:19,130 --> 00:54:31,310
This is the the paper published in Frontiers in Psychology, Trade, Procrastination and mobile phone teaching among Chinese college students.

408
00:54:32,600 --> 00:54:36,380
You know, so, so, so. So then the link had this association.

409
00:54:37,340 --> 00:54:50,390
So later on, after you finish collecting data of the device data, I will ask you to go a of web page where you were.

410
00:54:51,380 --> 00:55:02,360
You can say there are ten questions and then you can answer the question that end the website of would generate a score for procrastination.

411
00:55:05,810 --> 00:55:14,990
So we will say whether or not your behavior mobile device use will be associated if this situation.

412
00:55:15,800 --> 00:55:21,770
Okay. Interesting. Right. So you all don't start that somehow and use your data.

413
00:55:23,000 --> 00:55:26,840
So as part of the information analysis.

414
00:55:27,320 --> 00:55:31,720
Let's do it. Have fun. Right. This is, of course, not fun to play retail time.

415
00:55:31,730 --> 00:55:39,950
Right? So so that's something I in my plan to really study the relationship.

416
00:55:40,790 --> 00:55:50,390
Well now we use to make a statement the price make your target lot more scientific and you are thinking is

417
00:55:50,810 --> 00:55:58,760
you were thinking of your data analysis becomes lot more rigorous how do you know is far more interesting.

418
00:55:59,420 --> 00:56:02,970
Okay so so so this is something that Google started.

419
00:56:03,120 --> 00:56:08,690
What things do you look at and why would need to worry about this kind of digital?

420
00:56:08,780 --> 00:56:12,180
Well, the digital data can help us to understand what.

421
00:56:12,510 --> 00:56:21,440
Right. So so something you start to think about this and you know of course can go what the outline I gave here

422
00:56:21,440 --> 00:56:30,260
because at that time I did my analysis based on those sort of existing publications or recent findings.

423
00:56:30,650 --> 00:56:33,890
But you can go something beyond that if you find something interesting.

424
00:56:35,090 --> 00:56:46,610
So we're like a daily mobile device, quick activity data in order to study behavior patterns as well as using intervention to reduce screen time.

425
00:56:46,730 --> 00:56:59,120
So, so that's something that you really want to later on will do together and to design interventions to reduce some unnecessary screen times.

426
00:56:59,360 --> 00:57:15,919
So I know that we will use following we have this primary sort of need to use the phone to talk to parents to do some work related costs.

427
00:57:15,920 --> 00:57:20,410
But, you know, sometimes the use of phone is unnecessary.

428
00:57:20,420 --> 00:57:29,720
So how do you reduce that or not? So free screen time is something like you want to compress.

429
00:57:29,900 --> 00:57:36,260
If we if this intervention is effective that you could, you know,

430
00:57:36,380 --> 00:57:47,300
purpose of reduce your screen time and to be more make more time for your own meaningful sort of work to date.

431
00:57:47,480 --> 00:57:58,880
And it is little known that pandemic stress or the you know the pinch you exacerbation of addiction to mobile device for students.

432
00:57:59,540 --> 00:58:04,070
So the data was collected during the peak of the pandemic.

433
00:58:04,460 --> 00:58:16,460
There was quite of anxiety in early 2021 because vaccination was just out and people had a lot of hope about this vaccination.

434
00:58:17,150 --> 00:58:29,540
And so hopefully that vaccination would solve this entire problem of pandemic and the normal anxiety and uncertainty sort of ahead of us.

435
00:58:29,540 --> 00:58:42,070
And so at that time and that kind of situation, how this digital features reflective sort of behavior as so so and.

436
00:58:45,950 --> 00:58:56,510
So they're not collection schemes. So this is talk about how they look like that and swing activity is recorded in real time by a mobile device.

437
00:58:58,070 --> 00:59:06,290
So this device, you know, as soon as you turn on the functionality, then you will ultimately report your behavior.

438
00:59:06,320 --> 00:59:09,530
Right. It's it's goes back.

439
00:59:09,530 --> 00:59:23,510
But you know how we're going to use that digital information to help us to to understand some behaviors and to study some in the problem.

440
00:59:23,600 --> 00:59:28,730
Right. So so it's basically a recording real time.

441
00:59:30,290 --> 00:59:38,209
So we collect the data interests of all those really on social apps, screen time and you know,

442
00:59:38,210 --> 00:59:51,860
the total number of pick ups and the and the time of first picker for the data of first pick up we use to record after users,

443
00:59:52,760 --> 00:59:56,150
we cut to mark the beginning and end of user name.

444
00:59:57,920 --> 01:00:09,260
So, so that's why I say that it's my sort of habit that when I wake up, the first thing I would do, I basically look at my APR.

445
01:00:09,260 --> 01:00:14,280
That's my wake up time. So probably is true for everyone nowadays, right?

446
01:00:14,300 --> 01:00:20,030
So you put your iPhone to the table and when you wake up in the morning,

447
01:00:20,030 --> 01:00:25,270
first thing you look at your time or you look at your social app or you will

448
01:00:25,310 --> 01:00:29,870
something like you will look at to see something is happening in the world.

449
01:00:29,870 --> 01:00:37,450
And what if that could be a surrogate marker to define the wake up time?

450
01:00:37,970 --> 01:00:40,730
Reasonable. Okay. So for this handout,

451
01:00:40,730 --> 01:00:50,660
we are using this screen time over 25 days store in the mobile device this period and record these words over different mobile devices.

452
01:00:53,450 --> 01:01:05,240
So it's not uncommon that this mobile device record at first pickup time past the midnight because the user uses the device after midnight.

453
01:01:05,850 --> 01:01:10,909
Right. So the first peak of time should be the time when the military uses device.

454
01:01:10,910 --> 01:01:21,649
The first time after we come to deal with this issue, we simply reset the time zone on the device to see the second time.

455
01:01:21,650 --> 01:01:31,430
So 3 hours later of the is the standard time which allows us to identify first, pick up the time plus 3 hours, of course.

456
01:01:32,030 --> 01:01:41,650
So so if I use like 1201 like one minute past midnight, my first pick up time will be like 1201,

457
01:01:41,660 --> 01:01:47,540
which is now the actually the record indicating my wake up time.

458
01:01:47,630 --> 01:01:58,780
So what I do is really just reset in my phone to a Pacific time or even Hawaii time I own like 6 hours later.

459
01:01:59,000 --> 01:02:07,070
So then you can easily see now what is your first pickup time and or something like that.

460
01:02:07,160 --> 01:02:11,360
And then of course, you, you transform add the back to recordings.

461
01:02:12,380 --> 01:02:16,370
So so that's why there is a little bit manual set up here.

462
01:02:17,900 --> 01:02:27,740
The good news is that we don't have many days to worry about, but something like you, you will use your phone to do that.

463
01:02:28,670 --> 01:02:32,479
So also I said that with this strategy of top entrance of one data point,

464
01:02:32,480 --> 01:02:42,200
you have the street type of recording do record rate for all from your iPhone and then you turn to a digital number in minutes.

465
01:02:42,440 --> 01:02:48,670
So this essentially to minimize the, you know, the the error.

466
01:02:48,910 --> 01:02:54,860
Okay, so so I have this hour function, you know, appendix.

467
01:02:55,730 --> 01:03:00,260
So so I are it this function.

468
01:03:00,740 --> 01:03:09,710
So from from this our minutes form to minute form so you can use my our function to calculate that.

469
01:03:09,860 --> 01:03:18,620
Okay. So, so, you know, to, to confirm that whether or not this two callers are actually upgrade each other.

470
01:03:21,140 --> 01:03:26,030
So, of course that there always some issues of entering arrows.

471
01:03:26,030 --> 01:03:41,610
So in practice, so this is something like in the early stage when people have data collected, they want that data entrance are correctly done so.

472
01:03:41,830 --> 01:03:46,320
How do you minimize the the the arrow defense?

473
01:03:47,050 --> 01:03:50,560
So in practice, people do use independence.

474
01:03:53,770 --> 01:03:58,420
So individuals to interpret the same data into different execution.

475
01:03:59,360 --> 01:04:06,060
Okay. So sometimes. Okay. So, so of course, this is costly.

476
01:04:06,070 --> 01:04:10,210
You need to hire two people to put in your data independently.

477
01:04:10,510 --> 01:04:21,400
Okay. Then later on, you just cross validate this to independently input data and save any discrepancies.

478
01:04:21,820 --> 01:04:26,730
So that's one strategy that you people in practice people to use.

479
01:04:28,220 --> 01:04:37,060
Another thing is that like if you have a study team in Canada, they use different right to deduce kilometers.

480
01:04:37,070 --> 01:04:45,500
We use models they use our surfaces like you measure temperature like you want to see, you know, some, you know, fevers.

481
01:04:45,710 --> 01:04:53,690
So if you do a COVID 19 study, right, a fever is one of the major symptoms of of this disease.

482
01:04:53,690 --> 01:04:58,700
And in Canada, they measure in Celsius. So here in USA, we've mentioned it Fahrenheit.

483
01:04:59,240 --> 01:05:07,310
And then this could be a data entering arrows. And because you use different, you know, in multicenter study use different unit data.

484
01:05:07,730 --> 01:05:16,100
So you have to make sure that the things will be, you know, coordinated and make sure that the data interests will be,

485
01:05:16,820 --> 01:05:23,150
you know, somehow controlled, that you don't have this city error in this situation.

486
01:05:23,330 --> 01:05:30,290
I mean, even you realize sometimes you will center centimeters, some use meters, and there is difference.

487
01:05:30,710 --> 01:05:40,910
The unit is a you know, the choice of unit often causes you think that this could that you really need to make sure that that

488
01:05:40,910 --> 01:05:47,809
is really controlled as a biostatistician involved in the early stages of the design data collection,

489
01:05:47,810 --> 01:05:51,070
you should remind you of PI.

490
01:05:51,230 --> 01:05:58,490
So your, your, your boss, the manager, that's how we're going to use units.

491
01:05:58,940 --> 01:06:07,040
Just make sure that this is one sentence that should be mentioned at the meeting, see what unit we're going to.

492
01:06:09,690 --> 01:06:12,980
Choose as the primary unit in the data.

493
01:06:13,470 --> 01:06:17,430
Okay. Make sure that every site involved this study we use.

494
01:06:17,430 --> 01:06:23,660
This is this is very easy sort of error to make practice.

495
01:06:23,850 --> 01:06:26,930
Okay. You make sure that this is no problem.

496
01:06:27,720 --> 01:06:31,110
Find the strategies to reduce. The total.

497
01:06:31,110 --> 01:06:38,340
To minimize. To eliminate. Now reduce, I would say to minimize or to eliminate the error.

498
01:06:40,080 --> 01:06:46,830
So that's basically the preparation step now moving out to data visualization.

499
01:06:46,890 --> 01:06:51,500
So data visualization is very essential in data analysis, right?

500
01:06:51,520 --> 01:06:56,760
So one picture is worth a thousand words.

501
01:06:57,000 --> 01:07:02,060
So you really need to say two days out before you do any modeling.

502
01:07:02,480 --> 01:07:14,280
Okay. So, so here we have basically a time series of 25 day records or 25 records over 25 days.

503
01:07:14,380 --> 01:07:26,820
Right. So you so you have this secret sequence of measurements from the same person, namely me to see actually a time.

504
01:07:26,820 --> 01:07:34,950
So data. Okay. And so so you will see the the our code is in the appendix.

505
01:07:35,220 --> 01:07:38,390
You can see the R code then.

506
01:07:39,000 --> 01:07:44,180
So you'll be first for the total screen time photo.

507
01:07:44,190 --> 01:07:48,760
So stay the social screen time and total number of hiccups.

508
01:07:49,140 --> 01:08:00,840
And, and, you know, you just see that because we know that the use of the mobile phones may be different over the weekdays versus the weekend days.

509
01:08:00,870 --> 01:08:09,300
Right. So you if you like, as I did here, I put the data point from weekends in RAT.

510
01:08:09,390 --> 01:08:12,680
So I just know that this is certainly the sun.

511
01:08:12,690 --> 01:08:26,099
The sun. So you just because typically we have different type of schedules during the weekends and versus the weekdays that you want to highlight

512
01:08:26,100 --> 01:08:36,870
them and see that you have some kind of different patterns about the use of your mobile devices over the weekdays versus the weekends.

513
01:08:37,080 --> 01:08:41,370
So you can hide out those places that may cause some of differences.

514
01:08:41,390 --> 01:08:50,940
And but you can say here, I don't see much difference because that was the period it was doing the how's the holiday or break?

515
01:08:51,810 --> 01:08:58,350
I told you that the the Windows Masters 2021 start, I think January 17th.

516
01:08:59,220 --> 01:09:08,190
So basically most of this period from January 3rd to January 27 were still sort of pre winter break.

517
01:09:08,640 --> 01:09:13,530
So we can days and and weekdays are no difference.

518
01:09:13,960 --> 01:09:23,100
So so you do not see much a difference. But if you look at your current data rate later this month or even in February versus the one in December,

519
01:09:23,100 --> 01:09:28,240
you probably would appreciate some differences because you now have all the scale.

520
01:09:28,260 --> 01:09:32,880
For example, you have to get up Tuesday and Thursday in order to come to my course.

521
01:09:33,540 --> 01:09:36,720
So. So your first pick up time may be different, right?

522
01:09:37,560 --> 01:09:40,860
So over Saturdays on the. Oh, no, I don't have classes.

523
01:09:40,860 --> 01:09:44,219
I can usually get up at ten even 1 p.m.

524
01:09:44,220 --> 01:09:52,020
I sometimes see that, you know, so you have a lot of freedom what to do that now, you know, over the weekdays I like to search.

525
01:09:52,020 --> 01:10:00,960
They have to come to class. Then you probably would get up. So so marked down those differences that you can see the patterns.

526
01:10:02,340 --> 01:10:08,879
Of course, we're looking at some of the individual time searches, each for one variable important.

527
01:10:08,880 --> 01:10:12,450
And certainly you can look at some pairwise scatterplot.

528
01:10:12,450 --> 01:10:20,639
And so, for example, you can go plot this three variables and look at the relationships.

529
01:10:20,640 --> 01:10:30,090
And so, you know, this total screen time and the total social screen time, screen time.

530
01:10:30,210 --> 01:10:35,250
So your apps are highly correlated. The correlation is 0.935.

531
01:10:35,250 --> 01:10:44,130
This you can say that I the maybe your your core issue is different, but my core issues are very high.

532
01:10:44,760 --> 01:10:50,339
So that means that, you know, this social screen time is highly quality,

533
01:10:50,340 --> 01:10:56,400
is very, very protective of predictive predictive to to the total screen time.

534
01:10:57,150 --> 01:11:04,170
However, the number of hiccups is not very moderately correlated.

535
01:11:04,290 --> 01:11:07,830
It's only 2.5 or so. Okay. So.

536
01:11:08,700 --> 01:11:18,660
So that, you know, so this is something that gives you some of this idea of what the how things are correlated.

537
01:11:19,950 --> 01:11:28,440
So two variables that are particularly interesting here is the daily proportion of screen time.

538
01:11:28,890 --> 01:11:35,280
So basically what you are trying to do here, you create a new variable that's now the record by your mobile device.

539
01:11:36,310 --> 01:11:41,650
So so how this new variable is defined daily proportion of screen.

540
01:11:42,130 --> 01:11:50,260
So your screen time is defined as a ratio of daily total social screen time over daily

541
01:11:50,260 --> 01:11:58,360
total screen time because people may have a different amount of time use their device.

542
01:11:58,360 --> 01:12:03,550
Some people use 5 hours or some day use five or some day use 3 hours, right?

543
01:12:04,180 --> 01:12:13,540
So so you can see that this to social screen time is highly correlated with your total screen time in my case.

544
01:12:14,110 --> 01:12:23,320
So day I use 3 hours, sometimes 5 hours. How do you scale them to a compatible sort of skill?

545
01:12:23,500 --> 01:12:32,290
Right. Because of course, if I use 5 hours a day, I'm very likely I'll use more time in my screen time, social screen time.

546
01:12:32,650 --> 01:12:37,060
Right. So how do you skill them to make the data somewhat comparable?

547
01:12:37,690 --> 01:12:50,380
So now you use this ratio. So basically I look at the percentage of other of my total screen time spent on the social apps.

548
01:12:50,770 --> 01:12:59,020
So this ratio will be very useful because later on when you share data across the individuals in the class,

549
01:12:59,560 --> 01:13:07,270
I know that you have very different behaviors and of course the total screen time will be looking will indicate different behavior.

550
01:13:07,270 --> 01:13:14,229
But if you want to as a sort of harmonized form, right, you have data on 16.

551
01:13:14,230 --> 01:13:18,940
So these are somewhat comparable, then this ratio is very useful.

552
01:13:19,270 --> 01:13:28,660
Okay. Another interesting variable is this of average screen duration per use.

553
01:13:29,230 --> 01:13:40,120
So what is that? Basically, I said that some people like to pick up their phone with no purpose and they just want to look maybe just 5 seconds,

554
01:13:40,150 --> 01:13:43,840
see if there's any news or some updates or something.

555
01:13:44,500 --> 01:13:48,399
Right. There is no particular purpose. They want to use their phone.

556
01:13:48,400 --> 01:13:55,570
They just pick it up and take a look so that they feel the being they're connected to the world, their friends work.

557
01:13:56,260 --> 01:14:06,520
So so then some people tend to use the phone this specific purpose for calling for some you know if there's

558
01:14:06,520 --> 01:14:16,060
a specific task the social is the use of the phone then the of the average is screen duration per use.

559
01:14:16,510 --> 01:14:30,040
So how much minute do you use? How much time you know per use that to reflect this addiction before right so people use

560
01:14:31,060 --> 01:14:39,459
average to reaching per use is more substantial than just compulsive or something like that.

561
01:14:39,460 --> 01:14:46,210
Right. So, so this is interestingly variable where you basically define this ratio of total number of,

562
01:14:48,250 --> 01:14:55,870
you know, the ratio of total screen time or total social time divided by total number of pickups.

563
01:14:56,740 --> 01:15:00,160
Okay. So you do this new variable,

564
01:15:01,780 --> 01:15:13,760
you create a new variable which will reflect some quantity of use or your phone rather than do some of this use for no purposes.

565
01:15:13,780 --> 01:15:21,850
Okay. So that you can do the, you know, some plot and came out of some correlations.

566
01:15:22,150 --> 01:15:31,629
So so they are the much trickier to understand.

567
01:15:31,630 --> 01:15:38,560
The first pickup is how do you effectively display the first pickup?

568
01:15:38,560 --> 01:15:50,290
As I say, that first pickup is a surrogate marker of your recap time so we can use this unique circle.

569
01:15:50,740 --> 01:15:57,850
This is like of a clock. So from the midnight to 24 hours.

570
01:15:58,150 --> 01:16:01,360
Okay, so you're now displaying the data on linear line,

571
01:16:01,360 --> 01:16:07,899
which you have seen like normal distribution, gamma distribution, payload distribution, everything.

572
01:16:07,900 --> 01:16:14,830
Right is you have your distribution histogram or something like that on the ninja line.

573
01:16:15,340 --> 01:16:27,880
But now if you want a clock were displayed or data on the manifold of circle which represents your clock, right?

574
01:16:28,390 --> 01:16:33,730
So you have a clock from midnight, zero hour to 24 hours.

575
01:16:34,630 --> 01:16:40,110
Then you want to plug. Were we couple times where you first pick a time on this circle.

576
01:16:41,490 --> 01:16:47,070
Right. So that gives you a more intuitive display when it happens.

577
01:16:47,490 --> 01:16:53,140
Okay. So so this so we regard this data as circulating.

578
01:16:54,480 --> 01:17:03,120
So, so that's why there's several ah, packages that you can use to understand your first pick up time.

579
01:17:04,290 --> 01:17:07,860
One package I use most of the time is called circular.

580
01:17:08,450 --> 01:17:18,210
Okay. This is our package that allows you to display the time for speak either as a sort of circularly circular variable or angular.

581
01:17:19,330 --> 01:17:22,550
Okay. I have the article there already. Okay.

582
01:17:22,560 --> 01:17:28,440
So so maybe I don't have much time to complete this part to show you.

583
01:17:28,440 --> 01:17:32,520
Just quickly see that you can do this top called.

584
01:17:33,240 --> 01:17:43,710
You can do this histogram plot out of the circular and you can do this density plot and to understand the distribution of the data on the circular.

585
01:17:43,740 --> 01:17:50,190
Okay. So just quickly remind you about the.

586
01:17:59,700 --> 01:18:07,830
So this is a clock, right? So. So this means is zero time.

587
01:18:07,850 --> 01:18:13,390
There's probably the reference time because it's a little circular, a manifold.

588
01:18:13,680 --> 01:18:17,550
This. This a circle. There is no origin.

589
01:18:17,850 --> 01:18:21,690
You have to pick up the origin as a reference, every point.

590
01:18:23,210 --> 01:18:34,860
The origin of. So let's say this is the midnight know midnight or 24 hours because you will run the circle, right?

591
01:18:35,490 --> 01:18:41,860
So now, of course, that there are several ways that used to describe the geometry of this.

592
01:18:41,880 --> 01:18:45,990
Right. Just to remind me, this sort of knowledge from your high school.

593
01:18:46,050 --> 01:18:51,870
Right. So if you put this as zero degree and so, first of all, you can use degrees.

594
01:18:51,900 --> 01:18:55,420
Right. To to describe the.

595
01:18:55,570 --> 01:19:03,610
So, for example, if you lose 24 hours, then this will be new, right?

596
01:19:04,090 --> 01:19:07,090
This this will be normal, right?

597
01:19:07,690 --> 01:19:12,970
So the norm will be, what, 120, a 180 degree.

598
01:19:13,750 --> 01:19:19,700
Then you would have this point now will be 6 a.m., right?

599
01:19:19,930 --> 01:19:23,230
This will be your 90 degree. Right.

600
01:19:23,680 --> 01:19:33,160
So? So this one. This one. So this will be your 1:21 p.m.

601
01:19:35,530 --> 01:19:41,530
9 p.m. Oh 6 p.m.

602
01:19:41,570 --> 01:19:48,450
Sorry, I'm confused, I'm nervous, but this is according to degree, right?

603
01:19:48,460 --> 01:19:55,720
So you have the minutes. All right. So you have 24 hours times 6 minutes of host.

604
01:19:55,720 --> 01:20:00,130
We use minutes, right? So this will be 144 minutes.

605
01:20:00,220 --> 01:20:03,340
Right? Right.

606
01:20:03,700 --> 01:20:13,160
So there you will calculate that you also this the minute they will say one degree is equal to how many minutes, right?

607
01:20:13,840 --> 01:20:21,160
So so so that so one fourth, one divided by 380.

608
01:20:23,950 --> 01:20:32,710
So this will give you basically one degree corresponds to how many minutes shooting this is 4 minutes.

609
01:20:34,750 --> 01:20:42,069
I believe you may be wrong. You can calculate that. Okay, this is so if I move one degree here, how how many minutes?

610
01:20:42,070 --> 01:20:45,639
Right. Because you record your sleep time in minutes, right?

611
01:20:45,640 --> 01:20:50,230
So and also then you have this sort of reading, right?

612
01:20:50,950 --> 01:20:58,749
So if you have radius one for this circle, the radius will be like two pi, right?

613
01:20:58,750 --> 01:21:07,480
This, this will be two pi. This will be a pie and this will be pie.

614
01:21:08,050 --> 01:21:15,190
Right? So this high will be the occurrence of this half circle, right?

615
01:21:16,000 --> 01:21:28,420
So okay, why won't I want to talk about the reading so of our clients because later on we will use a famous distribution.

616
01:21:28,420 --> 01:21:33,970
Probably never heard from 264162 is called long measles distribution.

617
01:21:37,720 --> 01:21:41,930
OH, Mrs. OH, Mrs.

618
01:21:41,930 --> 01:21:47,390
Distribution. This is a whole and so extensive teaching poor study.

619
01:21:47,400 --> 01:21:52,970
How do you do statistical distribution on a circle?

620
01:21:53,630 --> 01:22:02,030
He defined this distribution of this sort of region from 0 to 2, pi or minus pi to pi.

621
01:22:02,210 --> 01:22:12,620
Okay. I would talk a little bit more, but I'm just telling you that because of the data you pick up in this from this device with the digital feature,

622
01:22:13,040 --> 01:22:16,840
you'll face this little bit different distribution. You like this thing.

623
01:22:18,200 --> 01:22:23,440
So this is called Suker data. You display that data in the form of a cog.

624
01:22:23,990 --> 01:22:30,880
This is some situation that you're going to use on this distribution, like a normal distribution,

625
01:22:30,890 --> 01:22:37,510
a normal distribution on Circle two as to being a standard fishing and do regression analysis something.

626
01:22:37,850 --> 01:22:42,140
Okay. So I will complete this part of the search.

627
01:22:42,980 --> 01:22:47,000
Thank you very much. Look at the sample.
