00:00:05,971 --> 00:00:09,070
Welcome to the series of
lectures on program planning.

2
00:00:09,070 --> 00:00:13,430
In this lecture we'll describe the process
of conducting formative research.

3
00:00:13,430 --> 00:00:17,550
Formative research is a process by which
public health practitioners gather data to

4
00:00:17,550 --> 00:00:22,260
inform the development and implementation
of programs and interventions.

5
00:00:22,260 --> 00:00:24,820
Formative research is
used to learn about and

6
00:00:24,820 --> 00:00:28,790
define a community of interest including
what characteristics of a community

7
00:00:28,790 --> 00:00:31,090
are relevant to a public health issue and

8
00:00:31,090 --> 00:00:34,740
how public health approaches should be
tailored to a particular community.

9
00:00:34,740 --> 00:00:38,010
Or the barriers that a community could
face in implementing a new public

10
00:00:38,010 --> 00:00:40,060
health program.

11
00:00:40,060 --> 00:00:44,280
Formative research is also used to build
report between a community interests and

12
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:47,970
the people who provide services to that
community, including public health

13
00:00:47,970 --> 00:00:52,918
practitioners, social workers,
medical doctors, and others.

14
00:00:52,918 --> 00:00:56,870
While formative research tends to focus on
data collection, it can also be used for

15
00:00:56,870 --> 00:00:59,150
community outreach.

16
00:00:59,150 --> 00:01:03,300
Formative research is an iterative
process, meaning it is done before,

17
00:01:03,300 --> 00:01:05,390
during, and after a program.

18
00:01:05,390 --> 00:01:09,720
This helps to maximize the effectiveness
of the formative research activities.

19
00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:12,570
Here's one example of a possible timeline.

20
00:01:12,570 --> 00:01:17,020
To prepare, the process starts with
a review of secondary data sources.

21
00:01:17,020 --> 00:01:20,700
This could include national,
statewide, or county level health and

22
00:01:20,700 --> 00:01:23,520
nutrition data or medical records.

23
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:26,450
Next we identify the gaps in knowledge,

24
00:01:26,450 --> 00:01:30,470
what we still need to know that can't
be learned from secondary data sources.

25
00:01:30,470 --> 00:01:34,830
Next we develop a state to fill in those
gaps, this could be designing a new survey

26
00:01:34,830 --> 00:01:39,300
or developing questions for an in-depth
interview with the key stakeholders.

27
00:01:39,300 --> 00:01:43,502
Then, we identify individuals who are able
to fill those gaps in knowledge, so

28
00:01:43,502 --> 00:01:45,950
this could mean identifying
key informants or

29
00:01:45,950 --> 00:01:49,737
primary stakeholders to interview
using the guide that we developed.

30
00:01:49,737 --> 00:01:54,131
Or it could mean identifying organizations
in the community that could help implement

31
00:01:54,131 --> 00:01:58,540
a new survey with community members
about a particular health issue.

32
00:01:58,540 --> 00:02:01,580
After the preparation phase
comes the action phase.

33
00:02:01,580 --> 00:02:04,720
So in this phase we collect data,
quantitative or

34
00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:09,190
qualitative, to inform our public
health program or intervention.

35
00:02:09,190 --> 00:02:13,620
After the data is collected, we can
reassess our initial gaps and knowledge.

36
00:02:13,620 --> 00:02:16,270
Did the data that we collect,
help address those gaps or

37
00:02:16,270 --> 00:02:18,880
were there additional gaps identified?

38
00:02:18,880 --> 00:02:21,180
This is part of the iterative process.

39
00:02:21,180 --> 00:02:24,440
If there is more knowledge that needs
to be gained, then the preparation and

40
00:02:24,440 --> 00:02:26,950
data collection phase can start again.

41
00:02:26,950 --> 00:02:29,750
If all the gaps were filled,
then we can move forward.

42
00:02:29,750 --> 00:02:33,390
In the implementation phase,
we incorporate the new information that we

43
00:02:33,390 --> 00:02:37,650
gained as part of the research process and
you set to informed changes to our program

44
00:02:37,650 --> 00:02:40,470
intervention to maximize
its effectiveness.

45
00:02:40,470 --> 00:02:44,890
In the end, our outcome is a successful
formative research process.

46
00:02:44,890 --> 00:02:47,820
Formative research can take months to
complete because the time it takes

47
00:02:47,820 --> 00:02:52,230
to build rapport within new community,
the process of primary data collection,

48
00:02:52,230 --> 00:02:53,850
it's iterative nature.

49
00:02:53,850 --> 00:02:56,610
And the time it takes to synthesize
new and existing data and

50
00:02:56,610 --> 00:02:59,510
the overall scope of program design.

51
00:02:59,510 --> 00:03:03,230
In the next few slides, we'll review
different approaches to data collection.

52
00:03:03,230 --> 00:03:05,429
The strengths and weaknesses of each and

53
00:03:05,429 --> 00:03:08,088
how they can be combined
into a single approach.

54
00:03:08,088 --> 00:03:11,150
There are different approaches
to conduct affirmative research.

55
00:03:11,150 --> 00:03:14,740
It can be qualitative or quantitative
depending on what the program planners

56
00:03:14,740 --> 00:03:18,640
need to know to design an effective
intervention, or it can be a mixed methods

57
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:22,820
approach which involves both
qualitative and quantitative research.

58
00:03:22,820 --> 00:03:25,360
Let's talk about each
of this in more detail.

59
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:28,050
Qualitative research involves
collecting descriptive or

60
00:03:28,050 --> 00:03:32,420
detailed data about a particular issue
often through in-depth interviews,

61
00:03:32,420 --> 00:03:35,865
focus group discussions or
content analysis.

62
00:03:35,865 --> 00:03:38,860
Qualitative research is
exploratory in nature and

63
00:03:38,860 --> 00:03:43,240
use to generate personal narratives,
uncover attitudes or ideas and

64
00:03:43,240 --> 00:03:47,640
discover new themes or
processes about a public health issue.

65
00:03:47,640 --> 00:03:50,460
Qualitative approaches can be
used if the program planners or

66
00:03:50,460 --> 00:03:54,330
researches need to understand
the needs of a new population.

67
00:03:54,330 --> 00:03:56,920
A potential limitation
of quality of research

68
00:03:56,920 --> 00:04:01,710
is that it may not be generalizable
to the whole population of interests.

69
00:04:01,710 --> 00:04:05,540
Quantitative research involves collecting
numerical data that is more representative

70
00:04:05,540 --> 00:04:07,330
of the population.

71
00:04:07,330 --> 00:04:11,026
This can include data on health behaviors,
health outcomes, and

72
00:04:11,026 --> 00:04:15,646
experiences that are measurable through
validated questionnaires and surveys.

73
00:04:15,646 --> 00:04:19,530
Unlike qualitative research which
is more exploratory in nature,

74
00:04:19,530 --> 00:04:23,423
quantitative research is often
used to test specific hypothesis.

75
00:04:23,423 --> 00:04:27,809
Examples of quantitative research
include health surveys, biomarkers and

76
00:04:27,809 --> 00:04:30,085
use of medical record data.

77
00:04:30,085 --> 00:04:34,125
And so that's primary and
secondary sources can be used.

78
00:04:34,125 --> 00:04:37,705
There's also the mixed methods approach,
which combines quantitative and

79
00:04:37,705 --> 00:04:41,357
qualitative methods into one study
to provide a broader perspective.

80
00:04:41,357 --> 00:04:45,997
If qualitative and quantitative research
both indicate the same findings, then this

81
00:04:45,997 --> 00:04:50,357
approach helps validate the results
obtained from each approach individually.

82
00:04:50,357 --> 00:04:53,377
There are strengths and
weaknesses in the mixed methods approach.

83
00:04:53,377 --> 00:04:56,867
The strengths are that using two
different methods to generate findings

84
00:04:56,867 --> 00:05:00,480
helps to overcome the individual
weaknesses of each approach.

85
00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:03,950
A mixed methods approach also
uses a wider variety of tools,

86
00:05:03,950 --> 00:05:05,860
like combining focus group with surveys,

87
00:05:05,860 --> 00:05:10,130
which provides more comprehensive data
about the population of interest.

88
00:05:10,130 --> 00:05:14,380
Another strength is that for purposes of
communicating with stakeholders, including

89
00:05:14,380 --> 00:05:18,610
both numbers, like the proportion of
individuals affected by an issue.

90
00:05:18,610 --> 00:05:23,990
And the most of the community provides
more appeal than one method alone.

91
00:05:23,990 --> 00:05:27,050
There are also weaknesses with
the mixed methods approach.

92
00:05:27,050 --> 00:05:30,470
First, because you're essentially
conducting two separate studies,

93
00:05:30,470 --> 00:05:33,160
it can be time consuming and costly.

94
00:05:33,160 --> 00:05:34,410
Second, qualitative and

95
00:05:34,410 --> 00:05:37,500
quantitative research involve
different analytic methods.

96
00:05:37,500 --> 00:05:41,670
One involves thematic or
content analysis of long transcripts.

97
00:05:41,670 --> 00:05:43,900
The other requires knowledge
of bio-statistics and

98
00:05:43,900 --> 00:05:47,128
perhaps even use of statistical software.

99
00:05:47,128 --> 00:05:50,580
And finally, it maybe challenging
to present findings from both types

100
00:05:50,580 --> 00:05:54,340
of research as you wanna be able to
explain each approach thoroughly but

101
00:05:54,340 --> 00:05:56,910
your space in time might be limited.

102
00:05:56,910 --> 00:06:00,530
Here an example of a mixed-methods
formative research project.

103
00:06:00,530 --> 00:06:03,820
This study was collected to inform
the design of a technology base

104
00:06:03,820 --> 00:06:08,490
interactive family intervention to promote
healthy eating and physical activity for

105
00:06:08,490 --> 00:06:12,470
young children at home.

106
00:06:12,470 --> 00:06:17,140
In this abstract, we see that the
population of interest includes low-income

107
00:06:17,140 --> 00:06:19,430
families, about 200 of them,

108
00:06:19,430 --> 00:06:24,400
with preschool-age children enrolled
at six head start preschool centers.

109
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:27,260
This study focus on four outcomes.

110
00:06:27,260 --> 00:06:32,501
Food behaviors and environments,
physical activities behaviors and

111
00:06:32,501 --> 00:06:36,441
environments, mobile device use,
and daily life.

112
00:06:36,441 --> 00:06:39,324
And as you can see for
each of these outcomes, qualitative and

113
00:06:39,324 --> 00:06:42,190
quantitative approaches were used.

114
00:06:42,190 --> 00:06:44,980
And finally the goal of
this project was again,

115
00:06:44,980 --> 00:06:48,640
a more holistic understanding
of participant behaviors,

116
00:06:48,640 --> 00:06:54,760
beliefs, attitudes and values related
to each of the four topic areas.

117
00:06:54,760 --> 00:06:56,100
Now that we've discussed the process and

118
00:06:56,100 --> 00:06:59,586
approaches of formative research we can
summarize the main points of this lecture.

119
00:06:59,586 --> 00:07:03,660
Formative research is critical for
understanding what programs or

120
00:07:03,660 --> 00:07:06,130
interventions are best suited for
your population of interest.

121
00:07:06,130 --> 00:07:10,070
It is also an important way to build
relationships with key stakeholders and

122
00:07:10,070 --> 00:07:11,900
community groups.

123
00:07:11,900 --> 00:07:15,300
In the last study, they also involved
pre-school teachers and staff in their

124
00:07:15,300 --> 00:07:19,330
study to help breach the divide
between classroom and home settings.

125
00:07:19,330 --> 00:07:22,880
Formative research is also used to develop
culturally appropriate programs and

126
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:24,800
robust study instruments, and

127
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:29,080
helps to understand how a program can
be successful upon implementation.

128
00:07:29,080 --> 00:07:30,917
Thanks you for watching.
