1
00:00:01,200 --> 00:00:14,800
That's good stuff, because I can tell you.

2
00:00:18,490 --> 00:00:43,180
I don't want to be around mountains or something because I know in my life, as I said, you know,

3
00:00:46,360 --> 00:01:17,510
I know by the concerns that we're considering, have really are loaded down with all those write.

4
00:01:17,880 --> 00:01:24,310
You know, it sounds like it's going to be.

5
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:32,160
I don't. I don't know what I don't know.

6
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:41,550
Maybe I don't want to put your name on if you don't have your I.D., put your name on it.

7
00:02:00,110 --> 00:02:13,530
Watch this.

8
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:11,130
To use the blank sheet at the end for scratch paper, and you just turn that off if you want.

9
00:04:50,900 --> 00:05:16,240
If. Yeah.

10
00:05:44,760 --> 00:05:47,850
You know.

11
00:06:13,500 --> 00:07:36,680
It's been. Don't you think you.

12
00:08:27,030 --> 00:08:47,280
He seems to be.

13
00:09:45,450 --> 00:10:40,170
She's. This is just the beginning.

14
00:11:25,220 --> 00:13:19,320
Okay. It's just.

15
00:13:52,100 --> 00:15:24,020
It's. Is.

16
00:17:39,700 --> 00:19:13,920
It's. If.

17
00:24:40,000 --> 00:25:18,520
He. And she says.

18
00:25:23,930 --> 00:25:52,790
It's just. It's just.

19
00:26:12,610 --> 00:26:18,870
It's just.

20
00:27:50,250 --> 00:30:40,130
Just. It's just.

21
00:30:53,420 --> 00:31:36,270
It's. Just.

22
00:32:14,750 --> 00:38:05,630
Just. This is how.

23
00:39:27,500 --> 00:40:28,020
Interesting. That's.

24
00:41:45,260 --> 00:42:12,050
She? It's.

25
00:44:36,990 --> 00:45:17,920
She? This.

26
00:46:32,110 --> 00:46:43,810
It's just.

27
00:48:34,540 --> 00:48:53,640
It's just.

28
00:48:57,140 --> 00:49:00,510
It's just.

29
00:53:44,190 --> 00:53:48,130
You can.

30
00:54:23,740 --> 00:56:41,520
He. He's.

31
00:58:06,750 --> 01:01:38,180
Okay. It's.

32
01:04:34,290 --> 01:05:21,150
It's. It's.

33
01:05:59,400 --> 01:09:08,860
She's. It's.

34
01:11:14,400 --> 01:11:21,900
It's 940. We can go to about 955 so that we can review four things about this class.

35
01:11:22,710 --> 01:14:44,750
Five extra minutes to go from now. Just.

36
01:15:47,860 --> 01:16:26,900
Picture. It's.

37
01:16:54,970 --> 01:19:28,290
That's. So she.
