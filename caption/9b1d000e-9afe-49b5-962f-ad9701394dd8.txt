1
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:22,120
OK, we're going to get started.

2
00:00:22,120 --> 00:00:29,740
So today's topic is historical context of global health, really interesting, really challenging to do in 80 minutes.

3
00:00:29,740 --> 00:00:34,120
But we're going to kind of do a very brief overview of the history of global health.

4
00:00:34,120 --> 00:00:41,230
And we're going to talk about it before that. I have just a couple of housekeeping things.

5
00:00:41,230 --> 00:00:47,560
One, I heard after class on Tuesday that a few of you have had a hard time hearing me.

6
00:00:47,560 --> 00:00:51,550
And I'm just so sorry, I think is just the mask and maybe the way the room is laid out.

7
00:00:51,550 --> 00:00:59,200
I also don't project super well, but so I reached out to SPH to see if we could get a microphone.

8
00:00:59,200 --> 00:01:05,500
They said they don't supply microphones like a classroom like this, but they're going to see if they can purchase one.

9
00:01:05,500 --> 00:01:09,640
If they don't, I'm going to look into getting one through the EPID department.

10
00:01:09,640 --> 00:01:14,740
So hopefully by Tuesday we'll have a microphone. I'm sorry we have to get through today without one.

11
00:01:14,740 --> 00:01:19,090
But if you can't hear me, if I start flagging, just like raise your hand.

12
00:01:19,090 --> 00:01:22,900
And I think same goes for like when you are speaking, for example, people over here,

13
00:01:22,900 --> 00:01:30,070
I think it's hard when you talk for people over there to hear you and vice versa. So, like, not that I recommend like shouting because of covid,

14
00:01:30,070 --> 00:01:35,560
but just kind of like try to project because I know it's hard with the masks, so that's all.

15
00:01:35,560 --> 00:01:40,990
And then I also wanted to introduce Sarah, who I introduced last time, but she's here today in the very back.

16
00:01:40,990 --> 00:01:44,980
She's kind of your go to about kind of any course logistics or technology.

17
00:01:44,980 --> 00:01:50,410
Again, like her role is not to play a role in instruction, but really to facilitate the class.

18
00:01:50,410 --> 00:01:54,880
And she's going to distribute she's making kind of like a paper seating chart.

19
00:01:54,880 --> 00:02:01,600
We're all supposed to stick sort of in the same spots throughout the semester for the purpose of contact tracing.

20
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:04,810
So just like write your name down in the spot on the chart and we'll try to stick

21
00:02:04,810 --> 00:02:11,440
to that exact same configuration throughout the semester before I get started.

22
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:18,390
Any, like, questions, concerns, anything to discuss as a class?

23
00:02:18,390 --> 00:02:27,130
No. OK, great. So OK, so before I get into the lecture, actually,

24
00:02:27,130 --> 00:02:32,620
we're going to do a small group activity that I mentioned last time and come up with our community guidelines for the class.

25
00:02:32,620 --> 00:02:40,690
And then I'm going to give a brief lecture on the history of global health and then we'll do our first round of discussion groups.

26
00:02:40,690 --> 00:02:43,870
So the community guidelines thing, I kind of alluded to this last class,

27
00:02:43,870 --> 00:02:51,970
but essentially we're going to deal with a lot of topics in this class that can be difficult issues around global health issues around coal,

28
00:02:51,970 --> 00:03:00,760
colonization, racism, sexism, kind of power differentials between countries, between different actors in global health.

29
00:03:00,760 --> 00:03:04,840
And we all come from different backgrounds and perspectives on these issues.

30
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:09,970
And so because this is a class that does have a heavy emphasis on active learning.

31
00:03:09,970 --> 00:03:14,650
I think it is important that we kind of collaboratively establish a sort of community guidelines,

32
00:03:14,650 --> 00:03:20,380
which is just kind of like an agreed upon set of behaviors and actions for our classroom conduct that

33
00:03:20,380 --> 00:03:26,320
allow us to have really spirited and respectful classroom discussions and interactions with each other.

34
00:03:26,320 --> 00:03:33,100
And ultimately, we wanted to create like a very inclusive and equitable classroom environment.

35
00:03:33,100 --> 00:03:35,710
So these are this is the activity.

36
00:03:35,710 --> 00:03:44,320
So in kind of small groups and maybe kind of turn to like the immediate three or four people, like in front the side behind you.

37
00:03:44,320 --> 00:03:49,690
Think about the best group discussions you've been a part of and why these discussions were satisfying.

38
00:03:49,690 --> 00:03:54,940
And then think about the worst group discussions you've been a part of and why these were unsatisfying.

39
00:03:54,940 --> 00:03:59,770
I'm going to make a Google document collaboration on canvas and invite all

40
00:03:59,770 --> 00:04:04,150
of you to it so you should see an invitation to a Google doc in your groups.

41
00:04:04,150 --> 00:04:08,590
Just get one person maybe to like suggest three things our class can do to promote

42
00:04:08,590 --> 00:04:13,450
good discussions and three things we can do to prevent unsatisfying discussions.

43
00:04:13,450 --> 00:04:20,590
And so the kinds of things that I'm thinking about with this are things like, you know, avoid using stereotypes,

44
00:04:20,590 --> 00:04:26,980
avoid using derogatory terms for social groups, like don't make assumptions about someone based on what they look like.

45
00:04:26,980 --> 00:04:35,890
We criticize ideas, not people like that kind of thing is generally what students tend to come up with during this type of exercise.

46
00:04:35,890 --> 00:04:46,390
Any questions before we start? OK, so we'll take maybe about ten minutes and like I said, kind of turn to your nearest like three or four people.

47
00:04:46,390 --> 00:05:07,900
I'll let you kind of sort yourselves and I'll send around a Google doc invitation to each of you.

48
00:05:07,900 --> 00:05:11,016
Or. Over the years, this is not a.

49
00:05:12,726 --> 00:05:17,616
Yeah. Make sure that people we're all on the same page in terms of what we're talking about.

50
00:05:17,616 --> 00:05:22,416
And if you think it's unclear what you're talking about, just to clarify it,

51
00:05:22,416 --> 00:05:31,086
explain your opinion calmly with reason and try to avoid getting frustrated, always endeavored to create a constructive and constructive environment.

52
00:05:31,086 --> 00:05:44,596
You said that and you want to elaborate on that? I think it's really important. Maybe there's a bunch of people who put that idea together.

53
00:05:44,596 --> 00:05:49,036
But, yeah, I think it I think it can be easy to get frustrated sometimes.

54
00:05:49,036 --> 00:05:52,006
But I think, like, this is constructive and instructive.

55
00:05:52,006 --> 00:06:00,406
And I think also this relates to a concept of kind of like giving grace and the idea that, like, we all come here with good intentions and open,

56
00:06:00,406 --> 00:06:09,826
like being open minded and to learn and just kind of remember that, yeah, a lot of a lot of these kind of refer to like being polite, respectful.

57
00:06:09,826 --> 00:06:13,106
I guess one thing to keep in mind is like what is polite and what is respectful,

58
00:06:13,106 --> 00:06:18,106
like different to different people, but just kind of treat people how you would want to be treated.

59
00:06:18,106 --> 00:06:24,976
Right. Being mindful of our contribution, speaking enough but not dominating the conversation,

60
00:06:24,976 --> 00:06:31,276
that is like the kind of relates to that conversation dance idea, no question is a dumb question.

61
00:06:31,276 --> 00:06:34,726
I think that is like the first rule of this class.

62
00:06:34,726 --> 00:06:40,636
Just because you have knowledge and on topic doesn't mean everyone else does a combination of different types of discussions.

63
00:06:40,636 --> 00:06:43,786
Yes. So we're definitely going to do small group discussions, most classes,

64
00:06:43,786 --> 00:06:48,256
and then we'll kind of check in again as a big group and kind of as lectures go along.

65
00:06:48,256 --> 00:06:53,956
I definitely like interrupt me. I want to hear from people. I want to hear your reactions and thoughts on the things that I'm saying,

66
00:06:53,956 --> 00:06:58,966
especially if you don't agree or if you like, if there's something you want to add to what I'm saying.

67
00:06:58,966 --> 00:07:04,006
And that can kind of spark the large group discussion. Yeah.

68
00:07:04,006 --> 00:07:10,696
Being open minded, active listening, acknowledging mistakes, all this stuff is really, really great.

69
00:07:10,696 --> 00:07:14,716
So I'm going to. So please keep adding to this as you want.

70
00:07:14,716 --> 00:07:21,076
Later tonight or tomorrow, I'm going to kind of consolidate everything and put like maybe categorize things a little bit.

71
00:07:21,076 --> 00:07:26,986
And I might add a few suggestions that students in my classes in prior years have had that I thought were really helpful.

72
00:07:26,986 --> 00:07:31,486
And then this will be available on canvas for all of us to review and just keep in mind.

73
00:07:31,486 --> 00:07:36,496
And so this is just sort of like our collaborative shared upon kind of set of community

74
00:07:36,496 --> 00:07:43,186
guidelines for just kind of how we operate as a class and what our classroom environment is like.

75
00:07:43,186 --> 00:07:54,816
Any other kind of like thoughts or questions are like things people want to say when we're here as a full group before on.

76
00:07:54,816 --> 00:08:05,886
OK, great. Well, thanks for putting this together, everybody, I hope it was helpful and productive for each of you to have as we go forward with that.

77
00:08:05,886 --> 00:08:18,666
Do we can we can we learn? OK, the lecture history of global health, I suppose,

78
00:08:18,666 --> 00:08:23,556
I think this is one where it's useful to just remember that like we all come from different backgrounds.

79
00:08:23,556 --> 00:08:27,216
For some of you, this might be old news. And you've studied this before.

80
00:08:27,216 --> 00:08:34,896
For others, it might be totally new. So if this is kind of like repetitive or background material, I'm sorry, we're going to go through it again.

81
00:08:34,896 --> 00:08:40,236
This is also very, very, very brief. Like we could have an entire course on the history of global health.

82
00:08:40,236 --> 00:08:48,366
It's really complicated. It's a really, really big topic. I'm going to do like a very whirlwind overview right now.

83
00:08:48,366 --> 00:08:52,146
So the 13 hundreds to eighteen, hundreds of medieval times. Right.

84
00:08:52,146 --> 00:09:00,276
This is when infectious diseases like the bubonic plague, cholera and smallpox led to massive epidemics and pandemics.

85
00:09:00,276 --> 00:09:06,456
And these really kind of spread through increasing global commerce and shipping over these centuries.

86
00:09:06,456 --> 00:09:14,046
As I'm sure we all know, bubonic plague had a really high attack and mortality rate affecting anywhere from 20 to 50 percent of affected populations.

87
00:09:14,046 --> 00:09:16,426
It was really devastating.

88
00:09:16,426 --> 00:09:24,426
And at this time, there was no like the state of science in medicine, there was no real kind of scientific knowledge of the causative agents.

89
00:09:24,426 --> 00:09:29,406
People attributed it to God, to fowl errors, to things like that.

90
00:09:29,406 --> 00:09:33,426
And that meant we didn't really have good interventions in general.

91
00:09:33,426 --> 00:09:39,666
However, the concept of quarantine was first created in thirteen forty eight, which I think is really amazing in Venice,

92
00:09:39,666 --> 00:09:46,606
where ships were required to wait 40 days before entering port to make sure that they didn't bring any kind of infectious agent on board.

93
00:09:46,606 --> 00:09:51,936
So even though we didn't have really a good scientific understanding of how infectious disease spread,

94
00:09:51,936 --> 00:09:56,916
there were kind of people did have some idea and there were some measures in place.

95
00:09:56,916 --> 00:10:03,996
And then actions to control epidemics and pandemics were typically local or regional rather than coordinated between nations.

96
00:10:03,996 --> 00:10:11,076
I think this was just a function of the level of communication that we had at that time globally.

97
00:10:11,076 --> 00:10:14,766
And then moving on, we have the concept of tropical or colonial medicine.

98
00:10:14,766 --> 00:10:20,826
And this is getting into the seventeen hundreds, eighteen hundreds and even early 20th century.

99
00:10:20,826 --> 00:10:21,946
This is really interesting.

100
00:10:21,946 --> 00:10:33,486
So imperial conquests, mostly by European nations, led to colonization of global regions including Africa, South Asia, North America, South America.

101
00:10:33,486 --> 00:10:38,766
And these kind of brought in massive exchanges of various infectious diseases,

102
00:10:38,766 --> 00:10:45,636
both between colonizing countries and people, as well as those who were being colonized.

103
00:10:45,636 --> 00:10:49,806
So, for example, colonizers brought smallpox, measles, TB,

104
00:10:49,806 --> 00:10:56,196
and these are largely credited to like all like huge reductions in population size, for example,

105
00:10:56,196 --> 00:11:05,676
indigenous populations in North America experiencing novel infectious disease who are brought by the Europeans who colonized and in turn colonizers,

106
00:11:05,676 --> 00:11:13,296
experienced illnesses such as malaria in Africa, sleeping sickness that they hadn't been exposed to before.

107
00:11:13,296 --> 00:11:20,916
And for both kinds of populations, these were totally like novel infectious diseases to be exposed to.

108
00:11:20,916 --> 00:11:26,976
And so people were immunologically naive and that led to quite devastating consequences.

109
00:11:26,976 --> 00:11:33,306
And during this time, so colonial medicine predated the concept of tropical medicine.

110
00:11:33,306 --> 00:11:38,166
And even kind of you see this in some of the oldest schools of public health,

111
00:11:38,166 --> 00:11:43,236
such as the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, still has that name in London, England,

112
00:11:43,236 --> 00:11:47,976
which was really born out of this era of tropical medicine where approaches to

113
00:11:47,976 --> 00:11:52,626
population health or what we might think of now as global health really tended

114
00:11:52,626 --> 00:12:04,236
to be imposed by colonial leadership and for the purpose of protecting health of colonists and associated workers and missionaries who came with them.

115
00:12:04,236 --> 00:12:08,406
If you read the Anderson paper, the nineteen ninety two paper,

116
00:12:08,406 --> 00:12:14,646
that was one of the readings about American colonization of the Philippines, he really gets into detail on this.

117
00:12:14,646 --> 00:12:24,036
It's a really, really fascinating paper. And I've also put a little image of a related book that he wrote called Colonial Pathologies,

118
00:12:24,036 --> 00:12:29,016
which again was about the American colonization of the Philippines in the early 20th century,

119
00:12:29,016 --> 00:12:35,226
and kind of this obsession that they had with kind of protecting the health and the stamina of

120
00:12:35,226 --> 00:12:42,456
the men who went to colonize the Philippines while still controlling the indigenous population.

121
00:12:42,456 --> 00:12:49,716
And so during this time, there were kind of these ideas that I guess colonial medicine and then the early days

122
00:12:49,716 --> 00:12:53,766
of tropical medicine were kind of focused around this idea or question of like,

123
00:12:53,766 --> 00:13:00,756
can white men survive in the tropics literally? And also keep in mind that this was before.

124
00:13:00,756 --> 00:13:04,716
This has kind of before germ theory, like this was like, you know,

125
00:13:04,716 --> 00:13:11,406
medicine as practiced a century ago and just kind of very rudimentary ideas of how infectious disease.

126
00:13:11,406 --> 00:13:18,276
And how the human immune system worked, as well as kind of broader social and political determinants of health,

127
00:13:18,276 --> 00:13:24,906
were not really recognized in the US and there was this very kind of like essentialist idea of acclimatization that,

128
00:13:24,906 --> 00:13:30,036
like light skinned Europeans needed to be in cold environments to survive.

129
00:13:30,036 --> 00:13:38,586
And that was kind of their natural environment where dark skinned people needed to be in hotter or could live in hotter, sunnier water environments.

130
00:13:38,586 --> 00:13:45,906
So very essentialist, very tied up with certain types of people bound in certain types of places.

131
00:13:45,906 --> 00:13:48,666
And this kind of like medical theory also very,

132
00:13:48,666 --> 00:14:00,246
very much was preoccupied with and absolutely influenced theories around racial differences and the actual creation of racial categories.

133
00:14:00,246 --> 00:14:06,966
And so it's not like like we could have a whole class on race and racism when we talk about this in my social epidemiology class.

134
00:14:06,966 --> 00:14:12,876
But really briefly, it's not like race is an inherent kind of biological or genetic trait that people have.

135
00:14:12,876 --> 00:14:22,866
But these concepts of race were created in large part through this colonial period where we started to see Europeans, for example,

136
00:14:22,866 --> 00:14:29,496
at colonizing different areas around the world and coming up with theories as to why European men would get sick,

137
00:14:29,496 --> 00:14:34,476
whereas people who were already living in the places they colonized had like did not get sick.

138
00:14:34,476 --> 00:14:37,236
And it's attributable to a lot of different things.

139
00:14:37,236 --> 00:14:44,106
But at the time, it was really thought to be these like essentialist ideas about differences between men and I say men,

140
00:14:44,106 --> 00:14:48,846
because men were really like the focus of study and all of this.

141
00:14:48,846 --> 00:14:55,026
There's a book called Curing Their Ills, which is about colonial power and African illness.

142
00:14:55,026 --> 00:14:59,346
So that's the title really by making fun. I haven't read it, I will say.

143
00:14:59,346 --> 00:15:03,336
But it was recommended by one leader who was the previous instructor for this class.

144
00:15:03,336 --> 00:15:06,926
So if you're interested in this topic more, definitely check it out.

145
00:15:06,926 --> 00:15:11,646
I think this is such a fascinating and important topic when thinking about the history

146
00:15:11,646 --> 00:15:17,766
of medicine and even thinking about the history of racism and racial classification, they're all very, very much tied together.

147
00:15:17,766 --> 00:15:25,026
So check out both of these books if you're interested in any questions.

148
00:15:25,026 --> 00:15:31,356
And then we kind of move on to the late 19th, early 20th century, this is still very much the era of tropical medicine,

149
00:15:31,356 --> 00:15:35,736
but we start to see some more international collaboration when it comes to disease control.

150
00:15:35,736 --> 00:15:37,596
So we're kind of moving in,

151
00:15:37,596 --> 00:15:46,806
moving slowly into a period of germ theory and really understanding kind of like microbial and virus based vectors of disease,

152
00:15:46,806 --> 00:15:50,196
as well as better understandings of the human immune system.

153
00:15:50,196 --> 00:15:57,336
There were international sanitary conferences that were held prompted by epidemics such as cholera and the yellow fever.

154
00:15:57,336 --> 00:15:59,556
We see the construction of PAHO,

155
00:15:59,556 --> 00:16:07,996
the Pan American health organization LAFI International Testing Public in France on the Far Eastern Association of Tropical Medicine.

156
00:16:07,996 --> 00:16:13,916
So we're starting to see some more international organizations that we're really focused on disease control.

157
00:16:13,916 --> 00:16:17,856
Another big one here was the League of Nations and the League of Nations was

158
00:16:17,856 --> 00:16:22,026
founded out of the Treaty of Versailles in the aftermath of World War One.

159
00:16:22,026 --> 00:16:30,366
The League of Nations was the precursor to the UN and the League of Nations also had a health organization which predated the WHL.

160
00:16:30,366 --> 00:16:37,266
So we started we're starting to see more international collaboration here as we move into the era of germ theory.

161
00:16:37,266 --> 00:16:41,226
And there were a few significant developments like technological developments

162
00:16:41,226 --> 00:16:46,056
for the control of infectious disease that happened in the early 20th century.

163
00:16:46,056 --> 00:16:50,016
One really interesting one is the completion of the Panama Canal,

164
00:16:50,016 --> 00:16:56,616
which connects the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans and is a major, major international shipping route.

165
00:16:56,616 --> 00:17:02,946
And one barrier to the completion of the Panama Canal in 1914 was outbreaks of yellow

166
00:17:02,946 --> 00:17:08,316
fever among the workers who are completing it and the completion of the Panama Canal.

167
00:17:08,316 --> 00:17:17,736
The Panama Canal eventually was facilitated through strict control of yellow fever, through community based sanitation measures.

168
00:17:17,736 --> 00:17:21,606
And these are actually quite harsh and quite punitive. So, for example,

169
00:17:21,606 --> 00:17:28,416
there were daily household inspections for people who lived near the area where the canal was being built for

170
00:17:28,416 --> 00:17:33,696
mosquito larva and their water supplies and people were fined if there were lava found on their supplies,

171
00:17:33,696 --> 00:17:39,256
which is quite harsh because this something that's a very, very difficult to control and eradicate.

172
00:17:39,256 --> 00:17:43,506
So we see. So I think this is just an interesting historical fact, and I think it's a good thing.

173
00:17:43,506 --> 00:17:47,766
I think this is extremely harsh and probably would not be done now.

174
00:17:47,766 --> 00:17:54,456
But it was really important with respect to economic development and the establishment of international shipping.

175
00:17:54,456 --> 00:18:00,216
The Rockefeller Foundation was established in the early 20th century in the United States.

176
00:18:00,216 --> 00:18:05,016
They developed a yellow fever vaccine in nineteen thirty six, which was a huge innovation.

177
00:18:05,016 --> 00:18:10,956
And there were other technological innovations in this time as well, such as chloroquine for the treatment of malaria.

178
00:18:10,956 --> 00:18:17,826
Penicillin was discovered and purified, became available during World War Two as an antibiotic antibiotic, which is huge.

179
00:18:17,826 --> 00:18:21,936
And then DDT was demonstrated to be an effective insecticide.

180
00:18:21,936 --> 00:18:27,036
And of course, we didn't know for a long time what the adverse health effects of DDT were.

181
00:18:27,036 --> 00:18:31,596
But it was really a question was I don't know what it stands for.

182
00:18:31,596 --> 00:18:34,956
It's an it's an insecticide. It's quite a harsh chemical.

183
00:18:34,956 --> 00:18:40,506
And it's been associated with increased risk of several cancers for people who are exposed to it.

184
00:18:40,506 --> 00:18:48,606
And now it's not really used so much anymore. DDT is the acronym for the chemical name, which I don't know.

185
00:18:48,606 --> 00:18:54,156
Yeah, I'll talk about it more in a second.

186
00:18:54,156 --> 00:18:57,756
But because it wasn't such an effective insecticide,

187
00:18:57,756 --> 00:19:05,666
people realized it could be used to kill the anopheles mosquito, which is the vector that spreads malaria.

188
00:19:05,666 --> 00:19:08,246
So kind of moving on post-World War two,

189
00:19:08,246 --> 00:19:14,696
this is when many people consider this era of tropical medicine to have moved on towards international health.

190
00:19:14,696 --> 00:19:18,026
So here we have a lot more international bodies forming.

191
00:19:18,026 --> 00:19:26,756
We have many different kinds of technological interventions that are available to reduce the risk and deal with spread of infectious diseases.

192
00:19:26,756 --> 00:19:32,636
The WTO, the World Health Organization, was established after World War Two.

193
00:19:32,636 --> 00:19:41,756
And again, it replaced the League of Nations health organization after the League of Nations was replaced by the United Nations.

194
00:19:41,756 --> 00:19:46,496
So, of course, the World Health Organization is one of the major actors in global health.

195
00:19:46,496 --> 00:19:54,176
Today, we also see the development of the United States Agency for International Development,

196
00:19:54,176 --> 00:20:00,716
or USAID in nineteen sixty one and USA aid was established as a result of the nineteen

197
00:20:00,716 --> 00:20:05,576
sixty one Congressional Foreign Assistance Act to unify foreign aid projects.

198
00:20:05,576 --> 00:20:12,866
So ultimately their goal is to kind of bring everything that the US was doing with respect to foreign aid under one umbrella,

199
00:20:12,866 --> 00:20:17,846
and then it was intended also to be free of influence from the military.

200
00:20:17,846 --> 00:20:24,206
And the U.S., again, is still one of the major actors in global health today.

201
00:20:24,206 --> 00:20:29,326
Did everyone put their name down on the seating chart? Perfect.

202
00:20:29,326 --> 00:20:39,776
Thanks. And kind of a lot of things happened in this last World War two era, but because this is a very brief overview,

203
00:20:39,776 --> 00:20:43,826
I'm going to be really selective and just kind of call out a couple of them.

204
00:20:43,826 --> 00:20:49,796
So one was the global malaria eradication campaign, which began in nineteen fifty five.

205
00:20:49,796 --> 00:20:54,566
So this is a bit of a misnomer because this campaign was not actually global.

206
00:20:54,566 --> 00:21:01,586
It was actually specifically focused on Africa and it wasn't actually really an eradication campaign.

207
00:21:01,586 --> 00:21:10,586
I think it was what we would refer to today as an elimination campaign because the goal was to eliminate malaria in human populations.

208
00:21:10,586 --> 00:21:19,586
But at the time, I think they still recognized that there may be substantial spread of malaria between mosquitoes and animals, for example.

209
00:21:19,586 --> 00:21:23,366
So occurring in the environment outside of humans.

210
00:21:23,366 --> 00:21:32,126
And so this eradication campaign, it relied heavily on DDT, like they just sprayed DDT everywhere, basically.

211
00:21:32,126 --> 00:21:37,046
And again, this is very much a technological intervention,

212
00:21:37,046 --> 00:21:44,786
doesn't really focus on some of the other reasons why people end up being exposed to the anopheles mosquito.

213
00:21:44,786 --> 00:21:51,326
There are other types of interventions that can be put into place, and it did work for a little while.

214
00:21:51,326 --> 00:21:57,206
So initially, rates of malaria did go down in places where DDT was sprayed.

215
00:21:57,206 --> 00:22:03,416
But a major problem that happened was the anopheles mosquito developed resistance to DDT.

216
00:22:03,416 --> 00:22:12,836
This ended up being a big problem because that resistance spread beyond the areas where DDT was initially sprayed to other regions in Africa,

217
00:22:12,836 --> 00:22:23,516
as well as outside of Africa as well. So DDT resistant mosquitoes became a big problem and this campaign was ultimately regarded as a large failure.

218
00:22:23,516 --> 00:22:34,196
By the 1990s, the incidence and prevalence rates of malaria were just the same as they were before the implementation of this campaign in the 1950s.

219
00:22:34,196 --> 00:22:37,346
And if you read the Rendel Packard interview,

220
00:22:37,346 --> 00:22:44,636
that was one of the Perus all readings you'll see he kind of talks about that because he was actually involved in that campaign earlier in his career

221
00:22:44,636 --> 00:22:47,756
and has since then become a global health historian and has some really

222
00:22:47,756 --> 00:22:52,466
interesting perspectives on some of these things that have happened in the past.

223
00:22:52,466 --> 00:22:56,006
So if you didn't read it, please do take a look.

224
00:22:56,006 --> 00:23:05,126
But in contrast to this global malaria eradication campaign, smallpox eradication in the 1960s and 70s was a huge success.

225
00:23:05,126 --> 00:23:11,006
And this is partly because the epidemiological characteristics of smallpox and how effective the vaccine was

226
00:23:11,006 --> 00:23:18,946
meant that these technical these technological interventions actually were effective in eradicating smallpox.

227
00:23:18,946 --> 00:23:26,696
I'll say that that is not the case for most infectious and non-communicable diseases.

228
00:23:26,696 --> 00:23:33,266
We largely need more than technological interventions to really reduce the incidence,

229
00:23:33,266 --> 00:23:39,896
prevalence and inequalities in the distribution of most ill health outcomes that we see today.

230
00:23:39,896 --> 00:23:46,736
When someone had a really nice comment on perusal, kind of making a connection between both of these things and how we're dealing with covid.

231
00:23:46,736 --> 00:23:51,236
Right. Like we have really good technological interventions to deal with covid-19.

232
00:23:51,236 --> 00:23:59,216
We have vaccines, we have masks. We know that doing things like improving ventilation reduces risk for covid-19.

233
00:23:59,216 --> 00:24:06,116
But we're also seeing like the fact that we have and we know about these technological interventions, we're still not eradicating it.

234
00:24:06,116 --> 00:24:13,766
And we're also definitely not protecting people who are most vulnerable to covid-19 through these technological interventions.

235
00:24:13,766 --> 00:24:19,286
And what we really need to be doing is addressing some of these root social and political issues

236
00:24:19,286 --> 00:24:26,066
that place certain people in groups of people at elevated risk for covid-19 in addition to,

237
00:24:26,066 --> 00:24:32,336
of course, using the technological innovations. So this was really a period of time.

238
00:24:32,336 --> 00:24:35,726
And we can talk more about covid like maybe in the discussion groups,

239
00:24:35,726 --> 00:24:39,446
because I think people this is kind of playing out in real time and relates back to

240
00:24:39,446 --> 00:24:43,046
some of these historical epidemics that have been dealt with in different ways.

241
00:24:43,046 --> 00:24:50,006
I think it is really useful to draw parallels between what's happening now has happened in the past.

242
00:24:50,006 --> 00:24:56,246
But I'll also say this kind of period, I suppose, of international health and again,

243
00:24:56,246 --> 00:25:00,536
we call it international health because it's really kind of like this one way flow

244
00:25:00,536 --> 00:25:06,596
where we have rich countries or high income countries kind of going into lower

245
00:25:06,596 --> 00:25:11,606
and middle income countries and imposing interventions without real kind of

246
00:25:11,606 --> 00:25:15,716
partnership and collaboration and input from countries that they're going into,

247
00:25:15,716 --> 00:25:23,726
not knowing whether the indicators that are being used for success are really appropriate, whether the interventions are wanted or appropriate.

248
00:25:23,726 --> 00:25:30,446
And so this period was really kind of defined by a focus on technological.

249
00:25:30,446 --> 00:25:37,526
Interventions without really addressing kind of key underlying root causes of why we're seeing diseases spread in certain ways,

250
00:25:37,526 --> 00:25:42,506
in populations or real partnership to address them as well.

251
00:25:42,506 --> 00:25:59,256
Any questions? Yeah, yeah, not only in this example, but you're get a lot of campaigns planned and the marketing is in everything, as you know.

252
00:25:59,256 --> 00:26:03,386
And so I find it very interesting that these global, as you said,

253
00:26:03,386 --> 00:26:15,296
the eradication to eradicate something requires, as we all know, requires a lot for so many different things.

254
00:26:15,296 --> 00:26:24,356
So I find that that I'm using that term is very interesting, the notion I was in that lesson or whatever,

255
00:26:24,356 --> 00:26:35,426
but that allows me to think about the wording or the verbiage that we use in other landscapes and when we truly need make it true to practice.

256
00:26:35,426 --> 00:26:42,336
That is such a good point because it expressly communicates that the goal is eradication and that's bold.

257
00:26:42,336 --> 00:26:46,496
And are we really going to do that just through spraying DDT? Yeah, yeah.

258
00:26:46,496 --> 00:26:51,206
I think that's super important to think about kind of going forward to the class and even thinking about,

259
00:26:51,206 --> 00:26:58,936
like our final papers, like the language that we use when planning interventions and communicating them super important.

260
00:26:58,936 --> 00:27:05,056
Yeah, I think. And kind of.

261
00:27:05,056 --> 00:27:13,206
OK, so during this time, I'm going to switch focus a little bit. This is still during this kind of like period or era of international health.

262
00:27:13,206 --> 00:27:18,936
There was a strong movement towards emphasizing a focus on primary health care and health care systems.

263
00:27:18,936 --> 00:27:25,356
We're going to talk more about health care systems on Tuesday. So in nineteen sixty nine, there was a World Health Assembly,

264
00:27:25,356 --> 00:27:32,826
and this was really motivated or sparked by the recognition of malaria eradication as a complete failure.

265
00:27:32,826 --> 00:27:38,916
And so this was starting to recognize that like a sole reliance on these technological

266
00:27:38,916 --> 00:27:45,606
interventions is actually not sufficient to reduce disease and improve population health.

267
00:27:45,606 --> 00:27:53,286
And they really emphasize the need to develop like a real functioning, coordinated health systems, especially in rural areas,

268
00:27:53,286 --> 00:28:00,336
and then specifically with respect to malaria control, to integrate them into general health services.

269
00:28:00,336 --> 00:28:05,946
And then after this, there was the at an international conference on primary health care.

270
00:28:05,946 --> 00:28:11,706
This was convened in nineteen seventy eight. In the other, which was the former capital of Kazakhstan.

271
00:28:11,706 --> 00:28:21,036
It was convened by the WTO and UNICEF. And the Almereyda conference is really focused on the importance of primary health care.

272
00:28:21,036 --> 00:28:27,186
It was the first international declaration that called for the building of primary health care systems.

273
00:28:27,186 --> 00:28:35,526
And it really called out, again, like I said, that approaches need to be tailored to local conditions and also tackle the underlying economic,

274
00:28:35,526 --> 00:28:43,626
social and political causes of ill health and not just rely on these single technological interventions.

275
00:28:43,626 --> 00:28:48,426
But this kind of didn't really go very far. This was a very short lived improvement.

276
00:28:48,426 --> 00:28:52,596
There was a lot of like the goals of Almereyda were really wonderful,

277
00:28:52,596 --> 00:29:00,096
but there was also a lot of critique put towards them that they were just like not attainable and not realistic.

278
00:29:00,096 --> 00:29:07,836
And there weren't a big problem with the audit declaration was that it actually lacked specific, measurable, measurable goals.

279
00:29:07,836 --> 00:29:17,106
So it was really difficult to measure whether or not success had been achieved in attaining what Almereyda set out in its declaration.

280
00:29:17,106 --> 00:29:20,676
There's a few good background readings. They were not required.

281
00:29:20,676 --> 00:29:28,566
But the paper by Walsch at all, for example, as well as the AMA itself, are on canvas in case you want to read a little bit more about it.

282
00:29:28,566 --> 00:29:38,496
And so kind of in response to the Almereyda declaration, people came up with this concept of selective primary health care.

283
00:29:38,496 --> 00:29:43,296
And this really kind of came out of this Health and Population and Development Conference held in

284
00:29:43,296 --> 00:29:51,696
Bellagio as a response to Almereyda and selective primary health care was focused on more smaller,

285
00:29:51,696 --> 00:29:55,686
more attainable kind of short term goals.

286
00:29:55,686 --> 00:30:03,966
They placed an emphasis on low cost interventions that had a limited scope but were actually feasible to monitor and to evaluate.

287
00:30:03,966 --> 00:30:15,666
And so part of this, a selective primary health care intervention movement was the introduction of Gobe by UNICEF in the early 1980s.

288
00:30:15,666 --> 00:30:22,116
And Gobe was this real focus on things like growth monitoring, oral rehydration therapy,

289
00:30:22,116 --> 00:30:26,016
breastfeeding and immunization as early childhood interventions.

290
00:30:26,016 --> 00:30:33,486
And this is with a recognition that childhood mortality is obviously an extremely important outcome.

291
00:30:33,486 --> 00:30:41,316
And like infant and early childhood mortality rates are actually highly indicative of a country's overall health and well-being.

292
00:30:41,316 --> 00:30:48,516
It's kind of like kind of the key red flag indicator. So this selective primary health care movement chose specifically to focus on

293
00:30:48,516 --> 00:30:55,506
these indicators and outcomes of early child health to improve population health.

294
00:30:55,506 --> 00:31:02,586
And again, it's easy also to criticize the selective primary health care movement like it's great in terms of setting kind of measurable,

295
00:31:02,586 --> 00:31:10,446
attainable goals. But we can also really critique it as not addressing the underlying social and political structural

296
00:31:10,446 --> 00:31:15,666
determinants of health and really kind of being like the safety net like shown here in this image.

297
00:31:15,666 --> 00:31:20,806
Right. Surely this person is saying, wouldn't it make more sense to build a bridge?

298
00:31:20,806 --> 00:31:25,446
Surely it would be better to address some of these root causes of ill health and populations

299
00:31:25,446 --> 00:31:31,206
rather than to come up with interventions after the fact to try and address them.

300
00:31:31,206 --> 00:31:37,176
And you can look up this reading if you really want to learn more about selective primary health care and its critiques.

301
00:31:37,176 --> 00:31:41,526
Yeah, and I think women have a lot of experience.

302
00:31:41,526 --> 00:31:48,576
He was saying that he thought that they should have basic health care and understand that distinction.

303
00:31:48,576 --> 00:31:52,566
Yeah, I think I saw that that sentence on the comment that you had on it.

304
00:31:52,566 --> 00:32:00,186
So my interpretation of that is that primary health care systems are systems that provide basic health services.

305
00:32:00,186 --> 00:32:09,576
So not that there are two separate things. But like basic services are like the types of services that primary health care systems would provide.

306
00:32:09,576 --> 00:32:18,576
So these would be things like immunizations, maybe kind of early child support for early childhood like health conditions.

307
00:32:18,576 --> 00:32:25,986
It's the place you would go like if you had a fever and you needed like Tylenol or something like that,

308
00:32:25,986 --> 00:32:32,646
the place you would go if you had an accident with like a broken leg, like a general practitioner is primary health care.

309
00:32:32,646 --> 00:32:38,916
And you seem to be making some distinction between primary care and basic care.

310
00:32:38,916 --> 00:32:49,406
I think the reason why primary health care is you talk about that successful in sense that these are things that they need more than just basic care,

311
00:32:49,406 --> 00:32:50,796
very wealthy.

312
00:32:50,796 --> 00:33:00,206
What are you making a distinction thing as opposed to some, you know, large scale primary health care system as opposed to just basic care?

313
00:33:00,206 --> 00:33:04,746
I think I mean, we need to look again. So basically, you're saying, like,

314
00:33:04,746 --> 00:33:09,066
the critique that he had was that primary health care systems were like not providing

315
00:33:09,066 --> 00:33:13,726
basic care or they needed to integrate it more into the discussion about why,

316
00:33:13,726 --> 00:33:18,576
you know, all of that worked in primary care and so forth.

317
00:33:18,576 --> 00:33:24,456
And then but what's still with me is basic health care as opposed to not being, you know,

318
00:33:24,456 --> 00:33:34,686
concerned about providing primary care as if it was, I guess, more comprehensive, just basic things in some more comprehensive thing.

319
00:33:34,686 --> 00:33:39,726
Yeah, no, that makes sense. Maybe let me look at it again, because I feel like my interpretation was that,

320
00:33:39,726 --> 00:33:45,816
like basic care was the type of service health care was providing, but maybe I didn't interpret it.

321
00:33:45,816 --> 00:33:56,446
Did anyone else have like a like a kind of interpretation or helpful answer to this question?

322
00:33:56,446 --> 00:34:04,666
Maybe I'll I'll look again and tell you what I think. So now we're kind of moving into the nineteen eighties here,

323
00:34:04,666 --> 00:34:12,676
and this is really like the neo liberal political era in the US and other kind of European high income countries as well.

324
00:34:12,676 --> 00:34:19,156
Nineteen eighty two, the budget is frozen and the US withholds its contributions to the US.

325
00:34:19,156 --> 00:34:24,236
The budget beginning in nineteen eighty five. And this is really terrible.

326
00:34:24,236 --> 00:34:33,466
I mean that's my personal perspective. They were kind of protesting against the show's essential drug program because this was opposed by US based

327
00:34:33,466 --> 00:34:40,156
pharmaceutical companies who were worried that it would cut into their profits and into their intellectual property.

328
00:34:40,156 --> 00:34:46,066
During this period, the influence of the World Bank grows, as well as the International Monetary Fund,

329
00:34:46,066 --> 00:34:53,626
the IMF and the World Bank and IMF made a lot of direct loans for health services to different countries.

330
00:34:53,626 --> 00:34:57,346
And they did this through what they call structural adjustment programs.

331
00:34:57,346 --> 00:35:04,006
You'll see this kind of sap and basically structural adjustment programs were essentially

332
00:35:04,006 --> 00:35:09,586
like lending from the WHL and the IMF for the provision of certain health services,

333
00:35:09,586 --> 00:35:11,686
but they came with strings attached.

334
00:35:11,686 --> 00:35:17,326
So, for example, I don't know if this is a real example, but a lot of them were based around things like education.

335
00:35:17,326 --> 00:35:24,676
So like a country could have X amount of money or dollars for a certain health service or for its health system in general.

336
00:35:24,676 --> 00:35:32,296
This came packaged in a lot of different ways. But, you know, a certain percentage of women would have to go to school.

337
00:35:32,296 --> 00:35:37,906
Um, but those which sounds nice, but those are actually very challenging to meet because if there are real

338
00:35:37,906 --> 00:35:41,926
structural barriers in place that are stopping women from getting into school,

339
00:35:41,926 --> 00:35:50,956
then the country loses its funding. And it doesn't address the root problem of the condition that the World Bank is making this money contingent on.

340
00:35:50,956 --> 00:36:01,876
And it also puts control, it puts control of health systems out of the countries that run them and their populations into the hands of the World Bank,

341
00:36:01,876 --> 00:36:09,646
which may or may not be the best organization to be kind of directing money towards another country's health system.

342
00:36:09,646 --> 00:36:16,486
And so and what this meant was that with funding coming from the World Bank and the IMF to support countries health services,

343
00:36:16,486 --> 00:36:23,516
then countries kind of just like slashed their own health budgets and didn't have domestic funding to support their own systems.

344
00:36:23,516 --> 00:36:27,886
We're going to talk more about IMF structural adjustment policies, I think, next month.

345
00:36:27,886 --> 00:36:34,156
Adel Daoud is a guest lecturer who's done a lot of work on IMF structural adjustment programs and child health.

346
00:36:34,156 --> 00:36:41,246
So we're gonna spend some time talking about these because these are super important. Any questions or thoughts on that?

347
00:36:41,246 --> 00:36:47,446
Actually, have people heard of structural adjustment programs?

348
00:36:47,446 --> 00:37:00,646
It's kind of a mix, yeah. We'll talk about it. And then in 1983, the HIV retrovirus was discovered and this really changed the face of global health.

349
00:37:00,646 --> 00:37:11,446
And, you know, this was kind of it happened at a terrible time because it was just during the rise of this neo liberal era where

350
00:37:11,446 --> 00:37:17,636
health obsessed health budgets had been gutted in countries around the world that didn't have a good budget.

351
00:37:17,636 --> 00:37:27,856
So it's a terrible time for this outbreak to a pandemic really to happen with kind of like the landscape of health and health systems.

352
00:37:27,856 --> 00:37:34,756
And, you know, there was a lot of focus on HIV. It was discovered in North America and in Europe.

353
00:37:34,756 --> 00:37:43,066
But then kind of as these countries over time and I'm not saying like there was a good handle on it because there wasn't in the nineteen eighties,

354
00:37:43,066 --> 00:37:45,466
but during the same time period,

355
00:37:45,466 --> 00:37:55,276
HIV AIDS activists and other organizations started also to really recognize the terrible extent of HIV in many African countries as well.

356
00:37:55,276 --> 00:38:01,636
And so HIV became a focus not only of domestic health, but also global health emissions.

357
00:38:01,636 --> 00:38:07,576
And some people really credit the HIV AIDS epidemic as kind of really ending the era of

358
00:38:07,576 --> 00:38:14,476
international health and helping to kind of move us back or move us into this era of global health.

359
00:38:14,476 --> 00:38:19,936
And a lot of this was to do with HIV AIDS activists in rich countries.

360
00:38:19,936 --> 00:38:25,966
These included student organizations. These included kind of grassroots community groups.

361
00:38:25,966 --> 00:38:31,936
And they really pushed back against a global health community that was socialized for scarcity.

362
00:38:31,936 --> 00:38:36,496
And this is a phrase that comes from Paul Farmer. There's a Paul Farmer.

363
00:38:36,496 --> 00:38:42,346
There's a textbook edited by Paul Farmer, among others. He's heard of Paul Farmer, read his work.

364
00:38:42,346 --> 00:38:43,906
Yeah, it's very popular.

365
00:38:43,906 --> 00:38:51,556
So he's got this great textbook called Reimagining Global Health, an introduction, I think, three of the chapters where background readings for today.

366
00:38:51,556 --> 00:38:56,206
We're going to read another one next week. But this is his phrase.

367
00:38:56,206 --> 00:39:00,296
And it's just kind of this idea that, like, there doesn't need to be scared.

368
00:39:00,296 --> 00:39:06,296
City in terms of our resources and our funding and our support that we're fighting over in global health,

369
00:39:06,296 --> 00:39:13,526
and there ended up being a huge boom in funding for HIV AIDS kind of research and intervention programs.

370
00:39:13,526 --> 00:39:16,826
And as you can see, this really went up over time internationally.

371
00:39:16,826 --> 00:39:26,696
Over the first decade of the 2000s, the main sources of funding were far and the Global Fund.

372
00:39:26,696 --> 00:39:36,326
But I also definitely recommend checking out farmers work on HIV AIDS, among other things, and kind of like where are we now?

373
00:39:36,326 --> 00:39:40,796
So, I mean, there's a lot I didn't say that was very fast.

374
00:39:40,796 --> 00:39:43,466
But now in the field of global health,

375
00:39:43,466 --> 00:39:51,176
we're seeing a lot more partnerships both internationally between nation states as well as public private partnerships.

376
00:39:51,176 --> 00:39:58,376
There's increased funding. So most global health researchers working in the US don't solely get their funding from the National Institutes of Health,

377
00:39:58,376 --> 00:40:01,466
which is the major government based health funding body.

378
00:40:01,466 --> 00:40:11,366
There will be a number of NGOs or private organizations where people will get funding support from a lot of philanthropy, other funding mechanisms.

379
00:40:11,366 --> 00:40:13,976
There's more of an emphasis on humanitarian motives.

380
00:40:13,976 --> 00:40:21,656
There are a lot of debates around ethics of global public health and how we do public service or how we do global health,

381
00:40:21,656 --> 00:40:24,176
a greater recognition of the global nature of disease.

382
00:40:24,176 --> 00:40:32,186
We see this with covid-19 and we're still even seeing like frustratingly very nationalistic approaches to the control of covid-19,

383
00:40:32,186 --> 00:40:38,816
which, of course, has, you know, has no respect for boundaries or the boundaries of borders.

384
00:40:38,816 --> 00:40:47,276
You know, we need kind of transnational interventions to reduce the impact of the covid-19 pandemic.

385
00:40:47,276 --> 00:40:53,126
We can't have nationalistic approaches also with climate change, like we kind of mentioned last time.

386
00:40:53,126 --> 00:40:59,606
Right. Like the effects of climate change are not restricted within the bounds of nation states.

387
00:40:59,606 --> 00:41:04,556
So we're having a greater recognition of the global nature of disease,

388
00:41:04,556 --> 00:41:13,196
recognition of infrastructure and workforce needs in countries that are receiving a lot of funding for global health support.

389
00:41:13,196 --> 00:41:19,256
Recipient countries are increasingly in control and making decisions as like real active partners,

390
00:41:19,256 --> 00:41:23,876
rather than having this one way kind of flow that we used to see in international health.

391
00:41:23,876 --> 00:41:34,436
And there's really a lot more emphasis on transparency, accountability, partnerships, community and community, participatory work.

392
00:41:34,436 --> 00:41:39,426
So where does global health funding come from? And go to very briefly?

393
00:41:39,426 --> 00:41:43,406
So this is a few years old, but I think it's still largely true today.

394
00:41:43,406 --> 00:41:47,186
So on the left hand side, this is where funding comes from.

395
00:41:47,186 --> 00:41:52,766
It's mostly from bilateral agencies. The U.S. is the dark red here.

396
00:41:52,766 --> 00:41:56,666
But kind of all these colors here are different bilateral agencies and different countries.

397
00:41:56,666 --> 00:42:02,636
We'll talk about what bilateral agencies are US NGOs is a big one, international NGOs.

398
00:42:02,636 --> 00:42:06,686
The Gates Foundation was a big one, of course, that no longer exists.

399
00:42:06,686 --> 00:42:11,936
We don't know what's going to happen. And then on the right hand side, where does global health funding go to?

400
00:42:11,936 --> 00:42:18,896
Still, most of it disproportionately goes to HIV AIDS, newborn and child health and Dark Purple, maternal health.

401
00:42:18,896 --> 00:42:20,936
And like purple, I hope you can all see these colors.

402
00:42:20,936 --> 00:42:30,386
OK is another major recipient of global health funding in terms of the area of health, that is the focus.

403
00:42:30,386 --> 00:42:36,626
And we can talk about whether this is still appropriate going forward and how we would reallocate funding as well.

404
00:42:36,626 --> 00:42:42,146
OK, major actors in global health. There is kind of three categories here, multinational organizations.

405
00:42:42,146 --> 00:42:46,886
These are organizations within and outside the U.N. system, bilateral organizations.

406
00:42:46,886 --> 00:42:56,576
These are government to government or sub government levels and then NGOs. So multinational organizations, these are things like the UNICEF, FAO,

407
00:42:56,576 --> 00:43:01,946
the Food and Agricultural Organization, UNESCO, the UN Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization.

408
00:43:01,946 --> 00:43:10,526
So real kind of like big multinational organizations. These are major funders and actors in the field of global health.

409
00:43:10,526 --> 00:43:14,456
Bilateral organizations are aid agencies.

410
00:43:14,456 --> 00:43:21,656
Is what essentially when aid assistance is provided by one government to another, sometimes it might flow through an intermediary.

411
00:43:21,656 --> 00:43:26,066
And these are primarily coming from wealthy countries to poor countries.

412
00:43:26,066 --> 00:43:32,576
So, for example, most of the thirty four OECD countries have some kind of bilateral aid agency in the United States.

413
00:43:32,576 --> 00:43:38,576
We have U.S. aid. The UK has has defeated Sweden, has Sweida, many others.

414
00:43:38,576 --> 00:43:47,426
They all have their own acronyms. And here is kind of a more complete list of the bilateral aid agencies that operate in the US government.

415
00:43:47,426 --> 00:43:54,686
So, for example, the CDC and NIH, they have their own bilateral aid missions and funding that they allocate.

416
00:43:54,686 --> 00:44:00,136
So this is just here, for your reference, I'm not going to read them out. And then NGOs, these are.

417
00:44:00,136 --> 00:44:01,396
Hugely diverse, right?

418
00:44:01,396 --> 00:44:08,506
So these can be nonprofit, they can be profit based, they can be religious, they can be secular, they can have a very, very broad scope.

419
00:44:08,506 --> 00:44:14,716
They can have a narrow scope. Some of them have a lot of funding. They're very wealthy, supported by a lot of philanthropists.

420
00:44:14,716 --> 00:44:22,666
Some don't have as much funding. They're just incredibly diverse, let's all say, about Anglos right now.

421
00:44:22,666 --> 00:44:27,976
And then finally, I want to talk really briefly about the Millennium Development Goals and the Sustainable Development Goals

422
00:44:27,976 --> 00:44:33,826
is kind of an overview in terms of where we are right now in terms of the field of global public health.

423
00:44:33,826 --> 00:44:40,426
So the Millennium Development Goals came out of the United Nations Millennium Declaration in the year 2000,

424
00:44:40,426 --> 00:44:47,656
and this essentially committed nations to a new global partnership to reduce poverty and set up a series of eight time bound targets.

425
00:44:47,656 --> 00:44:52,246
They had a deadline of twenty fifteen. So we've passed the deadline for the Millennium Development Goals.

426
00:44:52,246 --> 00:44:58,006
And they were really focused on achievable, sustainable and multi sectoral action and development.

427
00:44:58,006 --> 00:45:04,606
These are the eight Millennium Development Goals. So they're really focused on reducing poverty, improving equity,

428
00:45:04,606 --> 00:45:11,176
improving social conditions like universal primary education, gender equality, reducing child mortality.

429
00:45:11,176 --> 00:45:14,146
But all of these really are extremely relevant to health,

430
00:45:14,146 --> 00:45:19,756
even those that aren't seemingly relevant to health at face value, such as achieving universal primary education.

431
00:45:19,756 --> 00:45:23,356
These are things that are going to raise the health and well-being of populations.

432
00:45:23,356 --> 00:45:26,756
And I'll say that not all of these Millennium Development Goals were met.

433
00:45:26,756 --> 00:45:29,376
We can definitely I'm not going to go through them one by one.

434
00:45:29,376 --> 00:45:35,806
I actually have some supplementary slides on each of these in progress that has been made that I have not yet put on canvas,

435
00:45:35,806 --> 00:45:39,496
but I will as kind of a reference for later, if you want to take a look.

436
00:45:39,496 --> 00:45:45,376
Um, but while not all the goals were met, there were actually a lot of successes.

437
00:45:45,376 --> 00:45:52,906
And this ultimately was a 15 year effort. And it is still widely considered to be the most successful anti-poverty movement in history.

438
00:45:52,906 --> 00:45:58,366
It really dramatically reduced the number of people living in extreme poverty and improved schooling rates.

439
00:45:58,366 --> 00:46:03,046
It reduced under five mortality. It reduced maternal mortality.

440
00:46:03,046 --> 00:46:06,676
I'm not going to go into specific actions that countries took to achieve this.

441
00:46:06,676 --> 00:46:12,016
Yes, I was just going to say somehow that they're not doing anymore.

442
00:46:12,016 --> 00:46:14,806
No, no, they're not. This is done.

443
00:46:14,806 --> 00:46:21,526
So like in the year 2000, when these were set out, they said by 2015, like, these are the metrics that we want to achieve.

444
00:46:21,526 --> 00:46:32,146
And many different actors, such as the WTO and like nation states and other kind of governmental organizations, took actions to achieve these goals.

445
00:46:32,146 --> 00:46:40,606
But it's done now. But now what we have is the Sustainable Development Goals, which came after the Millennium Development Goals.

446
00:46:40,606 --> 00:46:45,586
And these were kind of developed out of a UN Sustainable Development Summit in 2015.

447
00:46:45,586 --> 00:46:53,896
So we are in this era of sustainable development goals now, which aim to build upon the successes and progress of the Millennium Development Goals.

448
00:46:53,896 --> 00:47:01,066
There are 17 sustainable development goals that are much broader and reach than the Millennium Development Goals, but they still have similar themes.

449
00:47:01,066 --> 00:47:06,616
And sustainability and kind of measurable metrics is like the real focus here.

450
00:47:06,616 --> 00:47:13,786
So things like ending poverty, reducing inequality, responsible consumption and production,

451
00:47:13,786 --> 00:47:18,556
climate action, these are all emphasized by the Sustainable Development Goals.

452
00:47:18,556 --> 00:47:24,016
And I've listed them out here and their full word and I'm just going to click through them.

453
00:47:24,016 --> 00:47:25,186
You can look at them later.

454
00:47:25,186 --> 00:47:31,786
But this is kind of the era of global public health that we're in right now is achieving the sustainable development goals.

455
00:47:31,786 --> 00:47:38,716
You'll see these referred to in several of the readings that are going to come up throughout the semester.

456
00:47:38,716 --> 00:47:46,946
That's all. So we have 20 minutes left in class. Are there any questions actually before we kind of move on to the next activity?

457
00:47:46,946 --> 00:47:58,276
OK. Yeah, I think to your students, we talked about how technology is enhancing our ability to do that.

458
00:47:58,276 --> 00:48:05,686
Are we going to talk about how technology that is? That is such a good question.

459
00:48:05,686 --> 00:48:14,296
So in terms of misinformation. Oh, my gosh. Yeah, that's a big problem, you know, and I'm not really into reading those pages.

460
00:48:14,296 --> 00:48:22,326
And yet how they use articles to even just pull things out of context, they're saying that that's not what you're saying.

461
00:48:22,326 --> 00:48:25,846
Yes. Yeah, I think it's a huge problem. I'm going to answer.

462
00:48:25,846 --> 00:48:42,596
But first, I want to hear the response on social media more to the fact that I have computer technology because it is an umbrella term.

463
00:48:42,596 --> 00:48:47,336
So, yeah, technology even in terms of a computer.

464
00:48:47,336 --> 00:48:53,596
And I still like and we saw this too, malaria in the past days.

465
00:48:53,596 --> 00:49:00,366
And even now there was a technology using genetically modified mosquito and.

466
00:49:00,366 --> 00:49:10,656
A lot of people seem confident in it that we won't know the results of the revolutionary arms race that happens to results in the new resistance.

467
00:49:10,656 --> 00:49:18,156
Yeah, and so we can say the mechanics of technology as well as social media and the public health.

468
00:49:18,156 --> 00:49:22,686
OK, thank you, baby.

469
00:49:22,686 --> 00:49:28,326
Yeah, I mean, that makes so much sense. Like Facebook is a major, major I don't think organization is the right word,

470
00:49:28,326 --> 00:49:32,556
but they have such a massive global reach and have been such a major source of

471
00:49:32,556 --> 00:49:37,386
disinformation and bringing people together to kind of form these conspiracy groups.

472
00:49:37,386 --> 00:49:45,176
And it's not like there's no regulation. Like they sort of they sort of have regulation, but it's really not implemented well.

473
00:49:45,176 --> 00:49:49,866
A lot of countries do, too. Yeah, yeah.

474
00:49:49,866 --> 00:49:57,246
Communication is good and it's super hard because it gets worse because I think people also gain a lot of benefit in other ways,

475
00:49:57,246 --> 00:50:03,876
like through these tools. So like it's not it's not an absolute power and absolute good, but it's a huge problem.

476
00:50:03,876 --> 00:50:11,766
We don't have a specific class about misinformation, like maybe we should be going forward as we should.

477
00:50:11,766 --> 00:50:14,316
But I definitely encourage, like,

478
00:50:14,316 --> 00:50:22,716
focusing discussions on this because I think that we like you can definitely link this to some of the things that we talked about today.

479
00:50:22,716 --> 00:50:28,746
And like you can also definitely get to some of the other lectures that are coming up later.

480
00:50:28,746 --> 00:50:34,386
So, for example, we do have one lecture on covid and it's coming later on.

481
00:50:34,386 --> 00:50:40,356
And like if you want to discuss it with your discussion group as articulately with respect to covid, I think that's a great idea.

482
00:50:40,356 --> 00:50:48,336
Um, but yeah, I wish we had a lecture on it now, but I think definitely like we've these into your discussion groups.

483
00:50:48,336 --> 00:50:52,176
And if you feel like that's what you want to talk about, you don't like the question I posed.

484
00:50:52,176 --> 00:50:59,136
Just go off topic and come up with your own question and talk about it. Is that a satisfying, a satisfying enough answer for everyone?

485
00:50:59,136 --> 00:51:02,946
But this is like we're all in this together. Yeah, yeah.

486
00:51:02,946 --> 00:51:10,126
Maybe we should, like, block off time and just talk about, like, covid and what's happening right now and kind of like connect this within an hour.

487
00:51:10,126 --> 00:51:15,906
Yeah. Yeah. Maybe we can maybe we can make this happen though.

488
00:51:15,906 --> 00:51:21,966
Thank you. But I think that's such an important point. OK, so for today's group discussion.

489
00:51:21,966 --> 00:51:25,926
Oh sorry. One more question. Actually yeah.

490
00:51:25,926 --> 00:51:31,146
I photographed about like expenditures on health expenditures.

491
00:51:31,146 --> 00:51:37,656
Can you raise your voice a tiny bit. Yeah. So you put a graph but we can be really here.

492
00:51:37,656 --> 00:51:46,456
Yeah. Oh my God. I don't know because this graph ends at twenty fifteen.

493
00:51:46,456 --> 00:51:51,256
I was kind of wondering, we're like everything's OK.

494
00:51:51,256 --> 00:51:57,876
Yeah. Yeah. Let me get back to you. Like if anyone finds anything will you like bring it to the class.

495
00:51:57,876 --> 00:52:03,876
And I will also look into this and we can check in again next time because I'm curious and I should have updated this.

496
00:52:03,876 --> 00:52:05,826
I just, I don't know. I didn't get a chance to.

497
00:52:05,826 --> 00:52:12,976
But I'm curious because I think it's going to totally change the landscape of is changing landscape of.

498
00:52:12,976 --> 00:52:19,136
To be honest, I was just going to say, look, we can definitely assume that between 20, 20, 20,

499
00:52:19,136 --> 00:52:30,026
21 and probably for the next few years that we'll see it first, maybe Cauvin or flu like symptoms or like SARS like symptoms have its own category.

500
00:52:30,026 --> 00:52:39,816
But, yeah, it's also interesting to see, like you see, like the story of history through where the funds are going, like in 2013, 2014.

501
00:52:39,816 --> 00:52:44,036
Here's a little bit more money going to Ebola. Yeah, that's what.

502
00:52:44,036 --> 00:52:53,156
Yeah, that's in the red. That's new. And again with I think what was it.

503
00:52:53,156 --> 00:53:01,636
Maybe but. All right, thought, but I think it's really interesting, I can see that with the money where it goes.

504
00:53:01,636 --> 00:53:04,296
Yeah, yeah, I think that's a really good point.

505
00:53:04,296 --> 00:53:15,786
I wondered when I looked at this for a look at this big piece of paper, could see this in terms of where the system is that most of is project that,

506
00:53:15,786 --> 00:53:22,156
you know, in terms of Africa is that, you know, we're that we're working on maternal health.

507
00:53:22,156 --> 00:53:30,816
Yeah, yeah, yeah. I'm also curious because we don't have this here, but it would be nice to see I mean,

508
00:53:30,816 --> 00:53:37,446
you could make more figures and kind of breakdown of the maternal health funding, like how is a globally distributed.

509
00:53:37,446 --> 00:53:45,006
Um, I don't know. And I'm sure it's changed over time and kind of a way like you mentioned,

510
00:53:45,006 --> 00:53:49,746
like it's kind of short in history and like how, um, burdens of disease are changing.

511
00:53:49,746 --> 00:54:01,176
But I think that's a great point. But again, I want to ask you, when you talk about NGOs, do you think about in terms of what the role of business,

512
00:54:01,176 --> 00:54:16,626
large corporations and sort of their agenda, how that impacts public health and then the whole discussion about NGOs and like private entities?

513
00:54:16,626 --> 00:54:22,596
That is that's a big question. And like we have 15 minutes left and I really want to do our discussion groups,

514
00:54:22,596 --> 00:54:27,366
but like my like my take on kind of like corporations or businesses or private

515
00:54:27,366 --> 00:54:31,476
entities is that like profit is always going to be their number one goal.

516
00:54:31,476 --> 00:54:35,586
And so that is something that concerns me because I think that's a real conflict of interest when it

517
00:54:35,586 --> 00:54:42,696
comes to like global health agendas and agendas to improve health and the health of Korean populations.

518
00:54:42,696 --> 00:54:53,046
That's my 30 second answer. I mean, if you could superimpose their agenda on top of these others, it would take it to make it interesting.

519
00:54:53,046 --> 00:55:01,656
Yeah, yeah. And I mean, maybe sometimes, like, those agendas can coincide or like I'm not saying they can never do good, but I would be skeptical.

520
00:55:01,656 --> 00:55:13,206
Yeah, yeah, yeah. OK, final question. I'm going to give one example of a private thing and um.

521
00:55:13,206 --> 00:55:21,276
Yeah. Like any kind of business or company like Nike or like Facebook is a private entity or

522
00:55:21,276 --> 00:55:32,836
private or government right now is like maybe I don't see what they get the public.

523
00:55:32,836 --> 00:55:38,586
Yeah. Yeah. Because I mean that would be like their ultimate goal, like marketing or something like that.

524
00:55:38,586 --> 00:55:45,396
I think you meant something a little bit different, more like Chiquita Banana and how they influenced a lot of probably,

525
00:55:45,396 --> 00:55:51,936
you know, the use of DDT and other things in environment because they needed certain thing to happen.

526
00:55:51,936 --> 00:55:56,266
And so, you know what happened in terms of public health.

527
00:55:56,266 --> 00:55:59,976
Yeah, a lot to do with what they wanted. Yeah. Yeah.

528
00:55:59,976 --> 00:56:06,246
No, that's and that's different from like maybe Nike's not like the best example. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

529
00:56:06,246 --> 00:56:17,136
Companies that outsource there were other countries that might have an incentive for health care reform.

530
00:56:17,136 --> 00:56:21,096
Yeah, yeah. Yeah.

531
00:56:21,096 --> 00:56:29,496
So company's going to increase in profit when consumers see through like oh they're donating to these causes I care about.

532
00:56:29,496 --> 00:56:39,216
I'm going to start shopping. In fact they start out to positivity with other companies the size in revenues and then they started using that.

533
00:56:39,216 --> 00:56:44,616
They started to do so. It's like the guys Ultravox.

534
00:56:44,616 --> 00:56:50,156
I promise you that I know they work so well.

535
00:56:50,156 --> 00:56:54,776
Yeah, yeah, I think we kind of the idea of like protecting health of workers,

536
00:56:54,776 --> 00:57:00,266
like when like companies will hire workers in like in factories and countries,

537
00:57:00,266 --> 00:57:04,526
that's kind of like an extension of this, like, idea of colonial medicine,

538
00:57:04,526 --> 00:57:09,896
of like protecting the health of the population because they're a source of labor. Yeah.

539
00:57:09,896 --> 00:57:18,716
Which OK, we're going to get to this discussion. I know there's so much more to say and I appreciate all of this, but let me skip ahead.

540
00:57:18,716 --> 00:57:22,406
So we have 10 minutes, OK? We're going to get into small groups.

541
00:57:22,406 --> 00:57:30,056
And again, I'm going to kind of let you get into groups of let's do like three to four people if you need five.

542
00:57:30,056 --> 00:57:36,626
That's also fine. And we're going to stick with these groups throughout the semester because we're not really supposed to change desks.

543
00:57:36,626 --> 00:57:42,146
And I'm sorry because I do like to shuffle things up. Usually there's three questions here.

544
00:57:42,146 --> 00:57:47,306
So first and you can kind of choose what you want to talk about as a group.

545
00:57:47,306 --> 00:57:51,056
What did you like or dislike about today's readings? Did anything surprise you?

546
00:57:51,056 --> 00:57:55,106
Or are the legacies of colonial medicine reflected in modern global health?

547
00:57:55,106 --> 00:58:00,086
If yes, in what ways? And that kind of touches on your point about workers.

548
00:58:00,086 --> 00:58:05,096
There's a conversation article that I think can really help frame this second question.

549
00:58:05,096 --> 00:58:08,156
You can look at it as a group or look at it later.

550
00:58:08,156 --> 00:58:14,156
But let's take ten minutes and I'll very quickly say, I think in most classes we'll come back and regroup as a whole class.

551
00:58:14,156 --> 00:58:19,556
But because we took time to do that kind of community tidelands activity in the beginning, we won't have time.

552
00:58:19,556 --> 00:58:34,766
So let's just take ten minutes and talk as small groups about these two, one or both of these questions.

553
00:58:34,766 --> 00:58:37,119
Tired of waiting here, you're the guy that running.
