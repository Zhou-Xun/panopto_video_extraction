1
00:00:01,230 --> 00:00:08,040
Three two automatically transformed into a Well, I think I could have turned it off.

2
00:00:08,210 --> 00:00:15,660
I was like, Oh, no, I turned it off. It was not the real thing. And I wasn't going to think and I.

3
00:00:16,080 --> 00:00:21,900
Oh, wait. Oh, no. She.

4
00:00:22,440 --> 00:00:34,820
She can't exactly know what I'm going to do.

5
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:55,730
I'm gonna do a lot better than you know.

6
00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:09,060
Yeah. I think it's okay to react slowly.

7
00:01:09,160 --> 00:01:16,200
I know he's not wrong, because is what this means.

8
00:01:17,810 --> 00:01:30,050
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

9
00:01:33,250 --> 00:01:39,440
Yeah, I agree. Yeah, I know.

10
00:01:39,620 --> 00:01:43,320
I know. I know.

11
00:01:45,330 --> 00:01:49,290
I'm sorry. I am really happy to have you here.

12
00:01:49,290 --> 00:01:52,440
I am so sorry. You're feeling better?

13
00:01:52,890 --> 00:01:58,410
No, I'm serious.

14
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:03,120
She's joking with something like.

15
00:02:03,210 --> 00:02:23,820
You're not going to be like, Oh, my gosh, I can't agree on a single day.

16
00:02:23,820 --> 00:02:27,600
But I'm like, Oh, yeah, I think that's what I'm saying.

17
00:02:27,630 --> 00:02:36,690
No, you're right. I think 100 acre site was.

18
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:54,900
Are you? You have to have really good things. Ramsey Street is literally just.

19
00:02:56,140 --> 00:03:00,000
Really? Yes. Good afternoon.

20
00:03:00,820 --> 00:03:04,550
I'm hoping you guys are enjoying this lovely afternoon. For November.

21
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:09,710
I like. It's unreal a little bit. Glad to see you all in class.

22
00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:12,900
And I'm going to try to have a little bit of fun today.

23
00:03:14,550 --> 00:03:19,260
I'm going to start with ice breaker. Risky business class is going to be about risk.

24
00:03:19,860 --> 00:03:29,520
Risk and more risk. So I would like to have you take one of the questions and just give me an answer.

25
00:03:29,940 --> 00:03:38,900
And I'm assuming you all know who the actor is, who plays with hands, who the actor is up there talking about the film?

26
00:03:38,930 --> 00:03:47,640
Oh, yes. Yes. Tom Cruise, I know he's a little bit, but hasn't seen the movie Risky Business.

27
00:03:47,700 --> 00:03:53,850
I have no time. So you as an iconic moment, you may know it from.

28
00:03:54,660 --> 00:03:59,399
He wears a white t shirt. He slides across the room in the white t shirt.

29
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:05,000
He does his little stance or whatever it signals. So, yeah, it's it's it was a fun movie then.

30
00:04:05,010 --> 00:04:09,780
It's a classic movie if you want to watch it with your parents or someone older, maybe.

31
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:18,030
But it was a classic movie, and it's still a classic movie, but Risky Business was was fun to watch at the time.

32
00:04:18,030 --> 00:04:21,930
So let's go with on this side of the room.

33
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:31,510
You doing grab a question. Okay. How small of an apartment in a business?

34
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:36,750
Well, at all. How small is the apartment? And can I put my office?

35
00:04:37,690 --> 00:04:41,530
Because New York apartments are a bathroom, right? Okay, your choice.

36
00:04:42,070 --> 00:04:47,290
I just got this small apartment. Small apartment. I was like, oh, okay, very good.

37
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:58,720
I really think I would rather drive a luxury car rather than having a private swimming pool and somebody start the attendant cheap.

38
00:04:59,050 --> 00:05:02,290
If you have applicants, they may have people who I see the laptop's okay.

39
00:05:02,300 --> 00:05:09,510
Okay. Need get. I have.

40
00:05:09,510 --> 00:05:12,530
Haven't read the paper. Okay.

41
00:05:13,570 --> 00:05:19,440
Hey. Hey. Go ahead.

42
00:05:20,580 --> 00:05:31,680
Oh, I said I would rather draw blood and have a some kind of vacation at the beach.

43
00:05:34,980 --> 00:05:45,810
This is really hard for me to use. I would rather see you in a luxury hotel than go camping in a private swimming pool in an electric park.

44
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:57,600
I would rather read a book or read a book where you get partnered by a luxury hotel.

45
00:05:59,210 --> 00:06:04,710
I'll take Vegas. I'd rather go to the beach with a friend and alone for the night.

46
00:06:04,740 --> 00:06:13,800
Okay, very good. Browse the Internet on my vacation at the beach.

47
00:06:15,690 --> 00:06:19,139
I'd rather spend a month in a small city. Small?

48
00:06:19,140 --> 00:06:22,810
Not a big city. Yeah, right.

49
00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:26,610
I would rather go to the movies with a friends. Go to movies with friends.

50
00:06:27,660 --> 00:06:31,890
I'll do the luxury hotels. American Express.

51
00:06:32,280 --> 00:06:36,240
I'm Beach Beach. A small apartment in a busy city.

52
00:06:36,510 --> 00:06:42,540
Small apartment, busy city. I would vacation in the mountains. Vacation at the beach.

53
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:46,140
In the mountains. In the mountains. Okay. Very good.

54
00:06:49,330 --> 00:06:56,420
Oh, sorry. I'm very engrossed in writing when I see photos, when I do the canvas and I'm like, I should just go for it.

55
00:06:56,440 --> 00:07:00,940
Okay. But I would rather do a small apartment in the city.

56
00:07:01,960 --> 00:07:05,110
I would rather vacation in the mountains.

57
00:07:05,410 --> 00:07:08,950
Vacation than. Okay. I would rather be around the movies.

58
00:07:09,880 --> 00:07:14,920
The movies with friends. I would rather spend the night at a luxury hotel.

59
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:19,659
I do want to vacation in the mountains. But in the kitchen.

60
00:07:19,660 --> 00:07:23,670
In the mountains. Okay. Very good. Okay.

61
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:33,670
Okay. Very good. Let's turn to some colleagues, and I'd be remiss if I didn't say I've been watching a lot of numbers on campus.

62
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:42,489
This illness is going on. I see you're handling it. So I do want to just be cognizant of the fact that something is going around and

63
00:07:42,490 --> 00:07:45,620
I will give you my head's up that from my level of thinking we're watching.

64
00:07:46,120 --> 00:07:53,560
There's there's definitely RSV for the young ones because Children's Hospital is definitely overrun.

65
00:07:53,650 --> 00:07:59,380
But for the most part, in college age, some of these things go on.

66
00:07:59,830 --> 00:08:03,460
It's not an alarming situation, but it's enough to say what's going on.

67
00:08:05,080 --> 00:08:08,590
Halls of campus. What happened? Yes, there's two of you.

68
00:08:08,860 --> 00:08:13,050
So I'm going to get David and then I'll get you. Go ahead.

69
00:08:14,620 --> 00:08:22,900
Me? Okay. I just had a question. Is it like I heard some form of COVID, but it's like a different strand or something like that's going on.

70
00:08:23,560 --> 00:08:30,850
So when working with Dr. Emily Martin, who is in this particular school in college, she's our lead epidemiologist.

71
00:08:30,910 --> 00:08:32,070
She does a lot with the CDC.

72
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:45,130
We were on the CDC call yesterday, and I can tell you specifically that the COVID variant is like in multiple forms right now.

73
00:08:45,160 --> 00:08:48,940
There's no be five that's just dominating right now.

74
00:08:48,940 --> 00:08:56,010
It's in multiple phases. So when you get tested, it's not COVID that you're getting.

75
00:08:56,020 --> 00:09:02,650
It's either adenovirus. Norovirus could be an RSV.

76
00:09:03,190 --> 00:09:12,410
But what we're seeing and everything that's being tested, it's not totally but COVID is still around because when we test it, we get the positives.

77
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:19,290
So there's a bunch of crud out there and you know, the first thing you think is I got cold it,

78
00:09:19,300 --> 00:09:27,090
but the regular stuff is out there too and it's becoming really, really aggressive too.

79
00:09:27,580 --> 00:09:33,550
We're like, okay, no one's really hospitalized, but it's still it's still taking you out.

80
00:09:34,010 --> 00:09:37,550
You're going to urgent care or things like that. So that's that's what we're seeing.

81
00:09:37,570 --> 00:09:41,850
I appreciate like all around the country for.

82
00:09:42,300 --> 00:09:45,879
Yes, yes, yes. Yes. And we're definitely see in Hertfordshire.

83
00:09:45,880 --> 00:09:49,150
In Michigan, for sure. Oh, did you answer a question?

84
00:09:49,450 --> 00:09:52,540
Yeah. Did I answer? I have not answered one yet.

85
00:09:52,540 --> 00:09:56,290
And I will do that. Let me grab the newbies. You don't get on.

86
00:09:58,240 --> 00:10:03,670
Oh, absolutely. Grab a question and answer it for me.

87
00:10:06,590 --> 00:10:13,490
I would rather go to the movies with a friend I can do alone on like the weekdays, but it's awkward during the week.

88
00:10:13,580 --> 00:10:16,640
You don't understand.

89
00:10:18,470 --> 00:10:24,500
I would rather vacation in the mountains because my time at the beach is basically reapplying sunscreen over and over.

90
00:10:25,250 --> 00:10:30,740
It's not that simple, and I think that gives me less relaxing.

91
00:10:31,700 --> 00:10:36,070
I would rather drive a luxury car than have a swimming pool.

92
00:10:36,140 --> 00:10:45,650
Super-G Swimming because you look like you get some length, so it doesn't turn out to be true.

93
00:10:46,760 --> 00:10:50,720
I'd rather browse the Internet on my computer. Very good.

94
00:10:51,860 --> 00:10:58,190
Okay. The question. I think I would rather move.

95
00:11:01,460 --> 00:11:07,160
I'd rather spend in a luxury hotel. Things I grew up in maybe Michigan.

96
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:13,760
So there's why that was my rationale for my answer was I did a lot of camping.

97
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:18,440
I grew up on six acres. Six brothers, two sisters.

98
00:11:18,440 --> 00:11:22,399
We did a lot outside. So been there, done that.

99
00:11:22,400 --> 00:11:25,640
And I need a little pampering right now in my life.

100
00:11:26,870 --> 00:11:30,830
So a luxury hotel would be would be nice for me.

101
00:11:31,070 --> 00:11:38,810
Okay. I'm going to leave that up and a little music out because this is about risk today.

102
00:11:39,260 --> 00:11:48,920
And before I get into the presentation and as a group, we're going to go through an effort, we're going to go through a risk every time.

103
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:55,760
And I'm going to tell you what's at risk right now. And I need you to vote majority rules.

104
00:11:57,740 --> 00:12:05,510
So, you know, this amendment, the final excuse me, the final is, I think the third week of December.

105
00:12:06,410 --> 00:12:09,560
The final is at risk. Your final is at risk.

106
00:12:10,300 --> 00:12:15,920
And it will either be online or to either be in-person.

107
00:12:17,240 --> 00:12:24,290
That's what's at risk. Most of the time. Your risk is not known, but you go into it.

108
00:12:25,070 --> 00:12:29,479
My name's, by the way, my stepdaughter called me and she said she won $2,000 last week.

109
00:12:29,480 --> 00:12:33,020
It's like, oh, okay. So and I said, are we going out?

110
00:12:33,790 --> 00:12:38,550
You know, it's so like gambling.

111
00:12:38,570 --> 00:12:47,059
You don't know what the returns are going to be. It could be good or bad, but but it's a risk that you take your your final is at risk now.

112
00:12:47,060 --> 00:12:54,290
Is everybody okay as a voting majority to have your final at risk before we actually get into the event?

113
00:12:54,290 --> 00:13:00,410
So by your hands, I'm offering for the final to be online.

114
00:13:00,620 --> 00:13:05,930
Is everybody okay with it? So it's very it's okay.

115
00:13:06,590 --> 00:13:12,560
So knowing that as a group, we're going to move forward with the final being online or in person.

116
00:13:14,150 --> 00:13:22,820
What I need to understand is, are we okay with it being on the shoulders of one person?

117
00:13:24,960 --> 00:13:30,590
Recall the idea what you want to do yet, but I do have the idea of what that person is going to do.

118
00:13:31,370 --> 00:13:43,460
So by show of hands. Now, are you okay with your final being online or in person on the shoulders of one person or a second?

119
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:47,410
Yeah. Yeah. Okay.

120
00:13:47,630 --> 00:13:51,390
Well, then why are you guys risk takers?

121
00:13:51,410 --> 00:13:55,910
Wizard. I see how with hands on, you know, I forgot what Jordi was doing.

122
00:13:56,150 --> 00:13:59,570
I saw that. I said, Hey, I think I have a majority.

123
00:14:00,440 --> 00:14:04,420
I am. I'm going to say I'm sure I have a majority. Just want to see it.

124
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:13,220
All right. So now we need to ask for a volunteer.

125
00:14:14,510 --> 00:14:20,480
So anybody willing to be the person that's online or in person.

126
00:14:22,830 --> 00:14:26,299
So the resident who's who's risk. You got this?

127
00:14:26,300 --> 00:14:29,990
Yes. All right. This is our this again. This is great.

128
00:14:30,300 --> 00:14:33,480
When have you come on down yet? Come on down, please.

129
00:14:33,500 --> 00:14:38,540
Hold on. So what? We're going to see your session right here.

130
00:14:45,020 --> 00:14:49,850
So go all the way. I was like, well, is this our final?

131
00:14:50,810 --> 00:15:04,920
You want to come here to be able to make it to audience?

132
00:15:06,120 --> 00:15:11,000
So it's a lot of risk and pressure on one person.

133
00:15:11,650 --> 00:15:15,980
Think of leaders who are running multimillion dollar corporations.

134
00:15:16,070 --> 00:15:24,350
I think of yourself when you become a leader and who, based on what you're doing, would have results of what you're doing.

135
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:29,510
Right. Okay. So glad that you found your ceremony familiar with the minutes winning games.

136
00:15:30,020 --> 00:15:35,660
You know this Kleenex right here?

137
00:15:36,920 --> 00:15:49,010
I told you. What was I trying to tell you this? I know what's going on in the rules, so, my gosh, I need someone from this section.

138
00:15:49,010 --> 00:15:54,980
This section in this section to pull out a stopwatch or watch your time and raise your hand.

139
00:15:55,670 --> 00:15:58,730
Raise your hand. I really.

140
00:15:58,770 --> 00:16:01,980
You have when someone has a timer. Something. Have a timer over on this night.

141
00:16:03,740 --> 00:16:07,740
All these guys. Thank you all. Good luck. Anybody in this section with the timer?

142
00:16:08,460 --> 00:16:11,700
One, two. Okay, the timer.

143
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:18,120
Okay. On your honesty. And, Your Honor, I will be trying to do, like, a minute count.

144
00:16:18,120 --> 00:16:22,370
I'm not going to go to my I'm not going to go to my computer and do a timer up there.

145
00:16:22,380 --> 00:16:25,740
I'm just fine, Your Honor, for doing this.

146
00:16:26,430 --> 00:16:30,040
And I am also thinking I might look at the at, you know,

147
00:16:30,630 --> 00:16:40,020
just so the minute to winning game is such that you cannot go in and grab the whole thing and pull it out.

148
00:16:41,520 --> 00:16:41,790
Okay.

149
00:16:42,940 --> 00:16:59,340
However, one minute of each sheet that not not one with your hands, all with the hands, what you can't do is you can't go in and pull it all out.

150
00:16:59,390 --> 00:17:03,100
Okay. It you can hold it and, you know, can you.

151
00:17:03,270 --> 00:17:08,850
However, whatever your method needs to be. Okay. You got to be careful with how you're holding it.

152
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:11,990
Can I use one? Handle this? Yes, you can.

153
00:17:12,030 --> 00:17:15,550
You can. You can use your hands. Can I use my feet? No, don't feel.

154
00:17:17,310 --> 00:17:20,730
Well, you never share those. So you're on.

155
00:17:20,730 --> 00:17:24,330
But okay. I'll never share the rules. Like that's what I was doing.

156
00:17:25,090 --> 00:17:29,550
Yeah, you can do everything, but really over control that box.

157
00:17:29,820 --> 00:17:34,620
Okay. Whatever you are comfortable with, you just have one minute to get each sheet out.

158
00:17:35,040 --> 00:17:39,840
We all know what's at stake. Yeah, it's either online or in person.

159
00:17:41,240 --> 00:17:45,000
Jen, I'm going to let you do your own.

160
00:17:45,450 --> 00:17:48,540
She's going to do her. She is right in front. And you can see my face, Molly.

161
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:54,510
She's going to get her own countdown ahead of the timer.

162
00:17:55,290 --> 00:18:02,730
So when she says three, two, one, or whatever a countdown is, you can look at all the girls now, both of them.

163
00:18:02,940 --> 00:18:09,420
Excellent questions. Nobody asked. She doesn't get them all out.

164
00:18:11,320 --> 00:18:14,910
Get to the person. Let's. Oh, my God.

165
00:18:14,910 --> 00:18:18,390
Please don't hate me. I'll explain.

166
00:18:18,840 --> 00:18:30,210
Last year it was online. This is how it is just right now.

167
00:18:30,930 --> 00:18:36,370
How old is she? This is the question.

168
00:18:36,660 --> 00:18:40,410
Yes. I'll just think about all the lectures we've had in class. There's always a component.

169
00:18:40,410 --> 00:18:43,550
I've just tested things. I've been able to strategise.

170
00:18:43,560 --> 00:18:51,389
This is all in. I can actually. I have a voice that we can not test for one reason.

171
00:18:51,390 --> 00:18:52,110
The reason I.

172
00:18:54,410 --> 00:19:09,590
Like last year was it a have you been involved have research on come up my boss was in the same was in the same brand the exact same exact same box.

173
00:19:09,590 --> 00:19:16,450
Exact same brand. Exactly like the way it's building seats are like so much weight.

174
00:19:16,660 --> 00:19:20,360
So everybody stands for that.

175
00:19:20,570 --> 00:19:28,720
Right? But even fewer do you want to go, go, go, go, go.

176
00:19:29,100 --> 00:19:32,510
We're ready. My time. My time is need to stand.

177
00:19:32,750 --> 00:19:45,680
Okay. I'm going to use these 20 are way, way, way, way.

178
00:19:46,020 --> 00:19:49,520
Now, do we need a double country? No. Bullying?

179
00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:58,550
Yes. Anybody? The team coaches. But not everybody. You know, we are all guys.

180
00:19:58,700 --> 00:20:06,830
No, nobody. This is just. You know, I'll tell you what.

181
00:20:06,990 --> 00:20:10,220
Doesn't matter. I don't know.

182
00:20:10,230 --> 00:20:14,480
Before let me know. We sent lady like two or three. You got. So you say you're s okay.

183
00:20:14,510 --> 00:20:18,420
Yes. If you guys have to please speak, not say it.

184
00:20:18,500 --> 00:20:27,260
Go on screen. Get her to clap for right now, we do have an important question.

185
00:20:27,560 --> 00:20:32,930
So like, even if the box falls on the floor, like she'll think before I go, I got to check.

186
00:20:32,930 --> 00:20:36,290
Every time I'm like, here, I'm here.

187
00:20:36,700 --> 00:20:44,540
You can see the man on the box is just like, yes, she's the only person on the bus.

188
00:20:44,810 --> 00:20:51,830
All right. All right. Thank you. How do you.

189
00:20:51,830 --> 00:20:57,230
Business environment, right? Okay. Any more tips for dollars one did.

190
00:20:58,590 --> 00:21:05,160
And we're going to give you a countdown. 30 seconds buttons are over here.

191
00:21:05,190 --> 00:21:17,500
Talk more during I'm going to give you 30 seconds because I think something else like it's like exactly as you can see, the odds are.

192
00:21:17,930 --> 00:21:23,959
All right, all right.

193
00:21:23,960 --> 00:21:31,220
Let's go now. Oh, yeah, that's right. That's right. Okay, so you're a countdown.

194
00:21:31,310 --> 00:21:36,350
She's going to countdown to when you hit the timer. So. Right. Three, two, one.

195
00:21:37,180 --> 00:21:45,090
Oh. Oh.

196
00:21:56,940 --> 00:22:19,360
That's going to. Oh 30 300000 €1 128 122.

197
00:22:19,360 --> 00:22:23,200
She was in here? No, she did it in 30 seconds.

198
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:32,610
That's just to remember what the moment was in that reality.

199
00:22:35,350 --> 00:22:39,480
Oh, oh, oh. Desperation.

200
00:22:43,990 --> 00:22:47,890
Thank you for going through that with me. Thanks, everyone.

201
00:22:48,940 --> 00:22:52,000
Well, how did you feel? I was struggling.

202
00:22:52,660 --> 00:22:58,090
Obviously, I wanted to. I how did you feel? I heard you were nervous before going in.

203
00:22:58,240 --> 00:23:01,460
Did you think about, you know. Oh, goodness. Or anything like that?

204
00:23:01,590 --> 00:23:04,990
I'm curious. How did it feel?

205
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:13,450
How did the whole process feel given you like the longer we wait a second rate, great interest.

206
00:23:13,750 --> 00:23:18,520
Okay. Anything else that you feel like going through?

207
00:23:18,520 --> 00:23:27,670
Like when she was doing, getting encouraged, were you feeling more confident the way she had her game going?

208
00:23:28,840 --> 00:23:33,490
I didn't know you could pull out of that thousand a petition like that.

209
00:23:34,360 --> 00:23:38,290
Oh, okay. Let me get to the press. Talk about my watch.

210
00:23:39,260 --> 00:23:42,410
Yeah. Oh, yeah. Really?

211
00:23:44,620 --> 00:23:47,890
Okay. Okay. Okay.

212
00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:54,850
All right. Thank you. So the point of that was there was a lot on one person show.

213
00:23:56,410 --> 00:24:08,650
And when we think about the pressures that we either self-imposed or are imposed on us when we are making risky decisions,

214
00:24:09,940 --> 00:24:20,340
but what can we do to think about things we can put in place or follow or work through when it comes to managing risks?

215
00:24:21,820 --> 00:24:25,720
You can manage how much you want to gamble. Right.

216
00:24:26,260 --> 00:24:34,390
And you don't have to get too anxious, because if you're not a big a big player, you're not putting $10,000 down on one bet and letting it ride.

217
00:24:35,080 --> 00:24:38,470
You might on a penny slot. So you.

218
00:24:38,760 --> 00:24:44,560
Yeah. And it's just important to know that we think about how we can manage our risks.

219
00:24:44,950 --> 00:24:51,400
And so is today our definition of a risk or risk event, which is something we just went through.

220
00:24:51,850 --> 00:24:56,080
What are the risk factors? Risk management process and applying risk management.

221
00:24:56,340 --> 00:25:04,180
H.R. Because as I said earlier, as you become leaders, when you graduate and after fellowships,

222
00:25:04,660 --> 00:25:12,280
there's going to be a lot at risk, whether it's dollars, jobs, health, emotional well-being, family life.

223
00:25:12,850 --> 00:25:18,280
It's just going to be a lot at risk in what you do because it's going to be some sort of an outcome.

224
00:25:19,840 --> 00:25:24,549
So what is risk? It's a discrete occurrence that may affect the initiative.

225
00:25:24,550 --> 00:25:29,680
For good or bad, it could have been good or bad.

226
00:25:32,630 --> 00:25:38,740
And so that was an occurrence that had a good outcome.

227
00:25:40,590 --> 00:25:46,990
Three What is risk? It's the ability to reduce, to achieve initiative goals.

228
00:25:47,740 --> 00:25:53,229
Good risks are known as opportunities. So that was an opportunity that you took.

229
00:25:53,230 --> 00:26:02,120
This was a good risk. Let me take a musical journey to the meeting and say this is unsafe.

230
00:26:02,700 --> 00:26:16,439
This was just. And if it's something that's driving farming and smelting in Memphis, I don't think it's mine.

231
00:26:16,440 --> 00:26:23,580
And then we had recommended them to do Hank and so really kind of love Dilbert for this.

232
00:26:25,230 --> 00:26:31,500
We need a risk analysis on this project before I can prove it.

233
00:26:31,860 --> 00:26:40,229
And then he goes through a couple of risk assessments and decision, and then the boss says, I don't understand this.

234
00:26:40,230 --> 00:26:44,040
And he says, Well, that's risky. Number 36, you got to think about.

235
00:26:45,370 --> 00:26:50,260
What's at stake is really what they're saying. Risk factors.

236
00:26:51,190 --> 00:26:55,480
This is kind of long. So I'm going to try to read this definition.

237
00:26:56,080 --> 00:27:05,440
Risk factors and inputs are individual attributes or characteristics of the physical and social environment that

238
00:27:05,440 --> 00:27:14,350
increase the likelihood that potentially harmful or harmful behaviors or positive or negative health outcomes occur.

239
00:27:15,250 --> 00:27:25,120
For example, for infrastructure, for a pedestrian walkway is at risk is a risk factor for road traffic injuries for those that just came in.

240
00:27:25,900 --> 00:27:34,930
Really need to congratulate your classmate. She took the risk class and your final will be online.

241
00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:41,790
Just me, you know. And so we're going through that particular process.

242
00:27:41,900 --> 00:27:47,540
Your classmates can explain the whole craziness that occurred going forward.

243
00:27:50,630 --> 00:27:56,870
And so the inputs or factors are knowing that you have background information.

244
00:27:56,880 --> 00:28:04,300
The only thing you knew was that there was going to be an outcome of a final being online or in person.

245
00:28:04,790 --> 00:28:09,710
Was historic lessons learned from similar initiatives I shared with you last year?

246
00:28:10,070 --> 00:28:14,720
Those are my next year. I get to give them more information.

247
00:28:15,680 --> 00:28:21,110
So that kind of helps you with with understanding the possibilities.

248
00:28:21,380 --> 00:28:31,430
Scope may tell you about the complexity of the initial one and it's one again team and stakeholder input and risk tolerance.

249
00:28:31,670 --> 00:28:33,140
You all were stakeholders in this.

250
00:28:34,310 --> 00:28:46,130
We all voted on our risk tolerance for the staffing plan, enough resources or expertise of staff in that role and outside contacts.

251
00:28:46,430 --> 00:28:57,680
There really wasn't one. But when you're thinking about risk, outside contacts can be risky for multiple things in health care.

252
00:28:58,820 --> 00:29:08,720
And why I say that is because if we brought in a cleaning company that we thought was five star and wasn't, what would happen in the rest halls?

253
00:29:10,030 --> 00:29:16,210
We're taking a risk when we bring in vendors or taking a risk when you bring in outside outside contractors.

254
00:29:23,560 --> 00:29:29,760
This slide. Since Nation.

255
00:29:38,940 --> 00:29:56,589
Phenix. So there's the risk management process that you see here, the blue, the blue book,

256
00:29:56,590 --> 00:30:01,120
the multicolored blocks, I should call them, the planning, the identification,

257
00:30:01,390 --> 00:30:09,790
while qualitative and quantitative analysis, the risk response and planning and the risk monitoring and control, what does what does that mean?

258
00:30:09,790 --> 00:30:12,790
And a little bit in detail how the risk process will be structured.

259
00:30:12,790 --> 00:30:20,410
It formed during the initial then in identifying determine the risks and how they will affect the initiative and the characteristics.

260
00:30:21,070 --> 00:30:28,750
When you're looking at the analysis, ranking, the probability and impact, I really felt like many of you did that.

261
00:30:29,920 --> 00:30:35,500
Like what's the probability of this really? Is this possible? Loved the questions that that came out from it.

262
00:30:36,700 --> 00:30:44,800
Figure out what we're going to do about it. And then monitoring according to the risk response plan.

263
00:30:46,040 --> 00:30:55,009
So that's usually what when we're thinking through opportunities or actions that we want to move forward, we also have to think about the risk.

264
00:30:55,010 --> 00:30:57,890
We thought about the stakeholders, we thought about how we're going to make decisions.

265
00:30:58,340 --> 00:31:02,420
Now, I'm asking you to peel back the onion a little bit and think about what's at risk.

266
00:31:02,600 --> 00:31:07,240
Who's at risk? Who does it matter to?

267
00:31:07,270 --> 00:31:08,110
What does it matter to you?

268
00:31:08,110 --> 00:31:16,720
And try to use and think about a process that gives you sort of a fair, balanced and fair look at the whole, whole opportunity.

269
00:31:18,700 --> 00:31:23,260
So as we go through these and I'm just going to go through each step, the risk planning,

270
00:31:23,560 --> 00:31:29,050
which is really a creation of a risk management plan that's going to include roles and responsibilities.

271
00:31:29,690 --> 00:31:35,169
I had a role. You had a role. I swear.

272
00:31:35,170 --> 00:31:42,480
I know these themes. Know, Jake, now we're getting it wrong.

273
00:31:42,540 --> 00:31:45,690
It's Newport Beach. It was a poker face.

274
00:31:46,830 --> 00:31:54,080
I know. I'm saying it right, but I'm okay. Okay. The poor had a role timing.

275
00:31:54,090 --> 00:31:57,660
How often will the process be formally performed?

276
00:31:58,110 --> 00:32:02,170
Thresholds. What will be acted on and not and not acted on?

277
00:32:02,760 --> 00:32:11,310
Reporting formats and tracking. So if you're going to take this risk, are you to monitor it?

278
00:32:11,730 --> 00:32:14,880
How do you know that's going well? What's going to happen to it?

279
00:32:15,240 --> 00:32:18,600
Who needs to know about it? What does it need to look like when you communicate it?

280
00:32:20,370 --> 00:32:23,450
Planning for all that. Planning for all that is important.

281
00:32:27,070 --> 00:32:32,650
Risk identification. Detailed initiative plan must be first created.

282
00:32:33,990 --> 00:32:37,650
Then review each milestone and discuss potential associated risks.

283
00:32:38,590 --> 00:32:41,790
So I'm going to go into an example here, but let me finish what's on the slide.

284
00:32:42,600 --> 00:32:45,660
Risks can be identified at any phase of the initiative.

285
00:32:45,990 --> 00:32:51,380
Categorizing risk is beneficial. Is this a technical rush?

286
00:32:51,390 --> 00:32:57,300
This is risk. Is this a financial risk? Is this external or regulatory risk?

287
00:32:58,080 --> 00:33:01,830
Yeah. And that's sort of beginning to beg, you know what?

288
00:33:02,430 --> 00:33:06,899
Who will be impacted and affected? Is it an internal schedule?

289
00:33:06,900 --> 00:33:11,820
Resources, cost, scope changes, trying to identify it.

290
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:19,790
And so. I do try to use Covert in this class quite a bit because it was unknown.

291
00:33:20,420 --> 00:33:29,360
We had no idea. But we knew death was was an outcome that was that was an assured from what we were hearing and what was happening.

292
00:33:30,110 --> 00:33:33,320
And so beginning to plan for it again.

293
00:33:33,890 --> 00:33:37,700
Stakeholders, what, what who needs to be involved, those sorts of things.

294
00:33:37,700 --> 00:33:44,930
But then identifying the risks of all of the things we actually knew could impact us.

295
00:33:45,230 --> 00:33:47,270
What was the technical risk if we didn't?

296
00:33:47,330 --> 00:33:55,880
If we did or didn't respond, what was going to be the quality of our services if we didn't or didn't respond literally what?

297
00:33:56,330 --> 00:34:02,330
Again, understanding what was happening on a at a country level, at the at the federal level,

298
00:34:02,990 --> 00:34:08,620
what if we didn't comply with any of those policies or procedures that were given to us?

299
00:34:08,620 --> 00:34:15,020
So we went our own way. We just did our own. We just we took a risk and said, I.

300
00:34:16,540 --> 00:34:19,920
I don't think it's going to resonate. But as I say, we're going to tell the delegate to talk to him.

301
00:34:21,040 --> 00:34:25,350
We're going to go out and do our own thing. What risk would we have been taking?

302
00:34:25,360 --> 00:34:29,920
We may not have received federal grants and fundings. We may not have received guidance from the CDC.

303
00:34:29,950 --> 00:34:34,270
We may not have received them. Think about those where they identify them.

304
00:34:37,150 --> 00:34:42,460
Identifying what was going to happen to students schedules, physicians, accountants, patients, schedules,

305
00:34:43,300 --> 00:34:51,730
all of that had to come into play when we had to decide to take the risk to shut down March 2020 and send you home.

306
00:34:52,450 --> 00:35:02,410
And then the same thing, constant daily interactions to think about when to bring open up campus again, when to bring you back.

307
00:35:03,250 --> 00:35:10,030
Will we taking a risk because there was no vaccine for 2020?

308
00:35:12,180 --> 00:35:19,139
The vaccine did not become available until December 2020 January 2021, March 2020.

309
00:35:19,140 --> 00:35:22,110
There were a lot of risks that we were taking at that time,

310
00:35:22,560 --> 00:35:27,280
and we really had to identify them with multiple stakeholders to understand what was going.

311
00:35:31,340 --> 00:35:36,050
There was a lot of analysis. There's a lot of analysis when you.

312
00:35:37,250 --> 00:35:44,390
Are really looking at something that's going to be a powerful impact to yourself or to others or to an employer.

313
00:35:44,960 --> 00:35:48,140
Determine which risks warrant responses.

314
00:35:48,710 --> 00:35:53,960
Determine the probability and impact, and determine overall risk ranking for those initiatives.

315
00:35:54,950 --> 00:35:58,969
We had lots and lots and lots of stakeholders involved,

316
00:35:58,970 --> 00:36:05,209
but we also had multiple subcommittees looking at the analysis of information and

317
00:36:05,210 --> 00:36:09,680
one was external facing what are we hearing from all of our federal regs with legal?

318
00:36:09,680 --> 00:36:13,790
And then the one was again with Dr. Martin. And what are we hearing with CDC being close to them?

319
00:36:14,060 --> 00:36:17,450
And then it was internal looking at the policies.

320
00:36:17,450 --> 00:36:26,090
And what we have is what can we do and what will impact. And I had already shared with you, we gave 8 hours or actually it was 80 hours of PTO time.

321
00:36:27,380 --> 00:36:34,880
What was the risk of doing that? Right. You talked about why it was important from a cultural standpoint, but that was a risk for the university.

322
00:36:35,420 --> 00:36:46,880
We had no idea at that time how long COVID would go, but we were willing to take the risk, gamble with people that we wanted to care for them.

323
00:36:47,810 --> 00:36:55,940
We looked at the data and how much it was going to cost us. And I can even say to this day that analysis is still going on.

324
00:36:55,940 --> 00:37:01,009
And the question is on the table about long COVID, what you've heard me share about,

325
00:37:01,010 --> 00:37:09,229
and if we want to continue taking that risk and keeping those hours available for for anyone

326
00:37:09,230 --> 00:37:16,070
that has COVID and long COVID looking at and assessing the environment to say COVID is around,

327
00:37:16,160 --> 00:37:22,100
we know that. But the degree of March 2020, we've come we've come a long way.

328
00:37:22,400 --> 00:37:27,470
So the risk seemed higher in March 2020 than it does now.

329
00:37:27,590 --> 00:37:38,150
And that's that's a lot of analysis that leadership is doing and looking at and trying to understand exactly when to move forward.

330
00:37:38,270 --> 00:37:41,480
But how many people have heard the phrase the data doesn't lie?

331
00:37:42,420 --> 00:37:46,890
You ever heard the phrase the date? It doesn't run because we wanted to be data driven.

332
00:37:47,280 --> 00:37:55,860
It wasn't just to feel good. It was doing the analysis, weighing them, having multiple conversations, looking at the probabilities.

333
00:37:56,070 --> 00:38:06,660
What will be the impact? Many of you were churning in your head and doing your analysis, and you asked me the question, well, how many are in the.

334
00:38:07,770 --> 00:38:16,400
You know, so that you could determine whether or not before would make it or not in that regard.

335
00:38:16,410 --> 00:38:19,260
But so you were you were doing your own mini self-evaluation,

336
00:38:19,260 --> 00:38:26,120
as many self analysis going in trying to determine whether we were going to move forward.

337
00:38:26,130 --> 00:38:30,830
We'd already decided, right? Sometimes you've already decided ahead of time on the risk.

338
00:38:30,840 --> 00:38:34,470
You knew the outcomes, but there are times you are not going to know the outcome.

339
00:38:36,180 --> 00:38:45,120
You take a risk every single time you submit a paper to me, do you not?

340
00:38:46,440 --> 00:38:54,850
If it's going to be. Measured in the way that it needs to be measured without even knowing what the outcome is going to be.

341
00:38:55,180 --> 00:39:07,180
It's that simple. To something as grand as we're going to take a risk in a new environment, in a new location, and put up a new hospitals.

342
00:39:09,100 --> 00:39:12,910
Beaumont and Spectrum took a risk in merging. What is that going to do?

343
00:39:12,940 --> 00:39:21,040
What kind of analysis does that look like? That was a huge risk. Mergers and acquisitions are going to be financial, but for the most part,

344
00:39:21,040 --> 00:39:26,830
it's taking a risk that the mission and vision of what you want will have the desired outcome.

345
00:39:29,080 --> 00:39:32,180
So an impasse for a second. Try and move on.

346
00:39:32,690 --> 00:39:38,670
I'm going to ask each section. So I asked and I'm able, but I'm struck somebody.

347
00:39:40,480 --> 00:39:47,420
Have you ever had a risk gone bad? We are going to risk gone back.

348
00:39:49,410 --> 00:39:54,030
You can feel that my head hurts. I'm good, though, huh?

349
00:39:54,120 --> 00:40:01,830
I'm here, though, but. Yes. Okay. Okay. I just want. Makes me need to have sex with you.

350
00:40:01,860 --> 00:40:08,100
Okay. So I'm excited. Okay. Anybody over here have had a risk gone bad?

351
00:40:09,270 --> 00:40:13,589
If so, what was it? Which guy? So it's. And it used to be manager at a gas station.

352
00:40:13,590 --> 00:40:20,670
So I took the risk of letting go of my employees and extra time for another employee,

353
00:40:21,270 --> 00:40:24,510
which is a risk I took and it backfired before employee quit on me.

354
00:40:25,480 --> 00:40:32,010
Now I have time that I need someone to fill for two employees and I'm missing two people.

355
00:40:32,010 --> 00:40:39,569
That meant I had to hire someone within a week, or that meant I needed to find someone to take on extra hours.

356
00:40:39,570 --> 00:40:42,600
So that was a risk that did not go well because I'm trying to save money.

357
00:40:42,600 --> 00:40:47,400
So I want you to know I'm sorry.

358
00:40:47,460 --> 00:40:53,200
I need to talk to you. Just the risk gone bad.

359
00:40:58,770 --> 00:41:02,190
When I was younger, I always tried to, like, have new business ideas.

360
00:41:02,190 --> 00:41:09,000
And there was a kid in my neighborhood who used to snowplow everyone's driveways, and he had a ton of people doing that.

361
00:41:09,120 --> 00:41:12,209
And then his family moved. And so I was like, Oh, perfect.

362
00:41:12,210 --> 00:41:15,530
All are going to do it with an extra formula at my car.

363
00:41:15,580 --> 00:41:22,979
And we brought up, brought it up an investment of late and I was like 13 and I got to use it like two days and then it broke

364
00:41:22,980 --> 00:41:27,719
and the part was on backorder for like months and it was like the worst snowstorm we'd had in like decades.

365
00:41:27,720 --> 00:41:31,020
And so I was like shoveling, like I was breaking snow shovels. It was just terrible.

366
00:41:32,700 --> 00:41:42,329
But I took the risk and I didn't do it anymore after that year just to make money for sure.

367
00:41:42,330 --> 00:41:46,470
And thank you for that end zone. My taking a risk.

368
00:41:47,460 --> 00:41:50,940
Happy to walk up and just eyeball somebody. But Valentine is better.

369
00:41:52,960 --> 00:41:59,260
I can go. I in high school, I went to a high school that had like 6000 kids.

370
00:41:59,270 --> 00:42:03,070
So the parking lot, like leaving high school was like always crazy.

371
00:42:03,790 --> 00:42:10,320
And I park, like, strategically close to the exit. So I could and I had to go to work after high school or after school ended.

372
00:42:10,930 --> 00:42:13,989
So there was a lot of traffic and there was just a tiny little lane,

373
00:42:13,990 --> 00:42:18,399
like a little opening I thought I could make because I had like just a Ford Fusion.

374
00:42:18,400 --> 00:42:23,620
I thought it was like a small car could make it. I ended up hitting the car that was parked next to me,

375
00:42:24,040 --> 00:42:34,430
scraping the entire side of my car like thousands of dollars worth of damage just because I thought I could, like, shoot the gap.

376
00:42:35,860 --> 00:42:38,739
You feel confident going in? Yeah. You're confident.

377
00:42:38,740 --> 00:42:47,860
You you've quickly put together your analysis, thought about you, plan for it, and you had and then you acted upon.

378
00:42:48,640 --> 00:43:00,190
So I'm sure we've all had something in that vein or another, but this is really to just have you take a step back when you're in your roles.

379
00:43:00,430 --> 00:43:08,110
Think about the full enchilada of what's at stake and what will the analysis look like.

380
00:43:08,110 --> 00:43:17,259
And so I can confidently tell you most of the time people will scrape cars when they jump.

381
00:43:17,260 --> 00:43:23,890
Don't like that. And I definitely would have loved Spencer for somebody to say.

382
00:43:24,190 --> 00:43:29,290
I mean, take a look at how you put the blade on somebody older, wiser.

383
00:43:30,510 --> 00:43:33,240
It would not have been within your purview to ask that question,

384
00:43:33,480 --> 00:43:39,630
but an adult who knew who was taking the risk also could have thought it through and said X, Y and Z.

385
00:43:40,050 --> 00:43:44,820
And then yeah, it didn't go very well.

386
00:43:45,630 --> 00:43:52,830
Planning in to see what the, what the opportunities would be if it was me.

387
00:43:53,370 --> 00:43:57,720
So yeah, there's, there's that. So doing the analysis is also important.

388
00:44:00,090 --> 00:44:06,740
Response strategies. That's step four options to determine the best action.

389
00:44:08,900 --> 00:44:18,860
So. We could have avoided all of this by just as a group saying, no, we don't want to do it.

390
00:44:19,940 --> 00:44:22,550
It was a risk opportunity, it was a risk event.

391
00:44:23,030 --> 00:44:31,159
But the response and I was ready to receive whatever from from a majority standpoint, I was going to push you because I knew it's possible.

392
00:44:31,160 --> 00:44:35,390
Because I've seen it. I've seen it. You didn't see it. It was your unknown.

393
00:44:36,530 --> 00:44:38,420
You just knew what the outcome was going to be.

394
00:44:39,500 --> 00:44:48,110
But response strategies to risks can be if something comes to you and it feels like a risky situation, you can avoid it.

395
00:44:49,900 --> 00:44:53,170
That providing a service or doing the activity because it's too risky.

396
00:44:54,340 --> 00:45:01,970
But you've done your analysis, you've done your data, and that's sort of kind of how you've come up to your to your decision something channel.

397
00:45:02,020 --> 00:45:32,090
Make sure. So.

398
00:45:35,620 --> 00:45:42,160
And so you can avoid it. You can think of mitigations to reduce the probability or consequences.

399
00:45:45,500 --> 00:45:50,180
And the rules were given, she decided she was going to hold the box.

400
00:45:50,210 --> 00:45:54,650
It was one of her mitigating standards and she was going to work and do do what needed

401
00:45:54,650 --> 00:46:00,230
to be done to sort of ensure that the risks she was taking might have a good outcome.

402
00:46:00,920 --> 00:46:13,160
You gave tips. There was definitely multiple mitigations asked for us, and then you can accept it and do nothing and say if it happens, it happens.

403
00:46:15,900 --> 00:46:22,950
And that one is really quite apathetic in my mind when when you just say, well.

404
00:46:24,490 --> 00:46:30,250
Toss it up. We'll just we'll just see what happens. Well, we'll just let it fall.

405
00:46:30,490 --> 00:46:34,300
That's usually gambling. That's how I look at that.

406
00:46:34,330 --> 00:46:39,670
I'll just. I'll just put one in and literally, let's just see what happens in that regard.

407
00:46:40,690 --> 00:46:49,650
Transference. What the poor didn't do was transport and transfer and make this another party.

408
00:46:50,100 --> 00:46:55,649
Make another party responsible for the risk. You said.

409
00:46:55,650 --> 00:46:59,400
Hold on. Oh, my God. But never ask the question.

410
00:46:59,400 --> 00:47:04,380
Did anybody else want you being able to transfer it?

411
00:47:05,040 --> 00:47:09,120
With COVID, we were all in it. I couldn't we couldn't transfer that to anybody.

412
00:47:09,630 --> 00:47:13,410
We it was all of us doing doing the work and what we need.

413
00:47:13,410 --> 00:47:15,600
But you heard me talk about contractors.

414
00:47:16,530 --> 00:47:25,200
And I mentioned earlier in the slide deck, when you think about a sidewalk and it has a crack in it, you know,

415
00:47:25,200 --> 00:47:33,989
it's either going to be the grounds and facilities of that county, that city, that local place that's going to be responsible for make of cement.

416
00:47:33,990 --> 00:47:36,930
Crack is not something that's going to be a liability.

417
00:47:38,410 --> 00:47:51,190
And they can either take that on themselves or contract and take that risk that there will be no liability with someone falling in that regard.

418
00:47:51,580 --> 00:47:55,330
We. Doing COVID took on.

419
00:47:56,660 --> 00:48:07,790
15 different contractors. Can anybody think about what vendor we might have taken on to take the risk?

420
00:48:09,680 --> 00:48:15,910
Managing COVID. What did what would that look like?

421
00:48:16,180 --> 00:48:26,790
What vendor do you think might be necessary? It might want to take on a contract with us to take the risk off of us doing the job.

422
00:48:30,840 --> 00:48:34,020
Cleaning from some spiders. This one for sure.

423
00:48:34,080 --> 00:48:38,720
That's my hand over here. So you handle it.

424
00:48:41,890 --> 00:48:46,180
The testing of links, the testing CSDP.

425
00:48:48,650 --> 00:48:52,040
Billions of dollars to run those to make sure that they were accurate.

426
00:48:53,450 --> 00:49:00,500
We we thought we could build the volume we needed in house, did not have the expertise,

427
00:49:01,310 --> 00:49:06,080
did not thought we could plan through it, that we could be ready for the fall and get everybody a test.

428
00:49:06,080 --> 00:49:12,600
And links said that, no, we do it. And so the risk was shifted to them.

429
00:49:14,100 --> 00:49:20,399
Cleaning was definitely one of them. Lots of analysis being done.

430
00:49:20,400 --> 00:49:26,100
Different vendors coming in to look at what we were doing, being able to look at our information.

431
00:49:26,100 --> 00:49:35,669
But we had multiple, multiple contracts in place to ensure them that we created the Michigan experience that we all were expecting,

432
00:49:35,670 --> 00:49:41,610
but we were dealing with companies. So you can shift that risk and or outsource it or.

433
00:49:42,770 --> 00:49:47,030
Ensure it. So that is truly and I will say,

434
00:49:49,370 --> 00:49:59,120
not only did you mitigate what you were trying to ensure that was going and part of the insurance was I had three different people, tiny.

435
00:50:00,870 --> 00:50:08,460
Not necessarily physical insurance bought, but it was insurance to say, you know what, we're going to protect this to make sure it is truly a minute.

436
00:50:09,210 --> 00:50:13,840
It's truly minute going. The.

437
00:50:17,220 --> 00:50:19,290
Steps involved in health care risk management.

438
00:50:22,320 --> 00:50:31,350
So when we think about employees and we think about the chronic conditions that we have within our 51,000 staff, a number of things bubble up.

439
00:50:32,820 --> 00:50:36,900
Nine times out of ten, we're always going to see cancer.

440
00:50:37,230 --> 00:50:45,490
We're going to see obesity, we're going to see anemia as that will bubble up as high costs to us.

441
00:50:45,840 --> 00:50:52,380
So, you know, that's a risk to us being able to provide health care when we see heavy claims.

442
00:50:52,560 --> 00:50:59,670
That's a risk to us in providing benefits and insurance that makes sense for our for our employees.

443
00:50:59,700 --> 00:51:07,320
Well, what can we do to mitigate that? We educate the employees on how to handle their own personal risks.

444
00:51:08,250 --> 00:51:17,580
I'm not telling you what to do, but we are trying to encourage healthy behavior to manage having a risky population that we are investing in.

445
00:51:19,380 --> 00:51:33,420
Updating all documents for the sake of reference. So a 1960s OSHA regulation probably doesn't apply today.

446
00:51:34,830 --> 00:51:45,000
Are your documents as up to date as they need to be for employees that you're managing and to be able to manage your own risk?

447
00:51:45,960 --> 00:51:53,190
What are you following? What are you going by and what are you holding other people to go by so that they're not at risk when you're managing them?

448
00:51:54,720 --> 00:52:01,800
Establishing coordination between all departments to accelerate the process and to keep a check on claims.

449
00:52:04,560 --> 00:52:07,590
So. That is really talking.

450
00:52:08,610 --> 00:52:13,530
Left hand knows what right hand is doing. Again, I'm going to go back to the sidewalk.

451
00:52:14,820 --> 00:52:18,030
If the vendor didn't communicate.

452
00:52:19,460 --> 00:52:29,270
That they were going to fix the sidewalk in three months and the county thought they were going to fix it within a week.

453
00:52:29,720 --> 00:52:36,920
That is just not communicating and coordinating between the two to decrease that risk.

454
00:52:38,360 --> 00:52:44,660
Taking steps to prevent what is avoidable. So what could we do?

455
00:52:45,140 --> 00:52:52,820
What could we do as the county to mitigate the risk of a huge crack in the sidewalk?

456
00:52:54,900 --> 00:52:57,240
You've seen them? We'll call her on.

457
00:53:02,880 --> 00:53:15,270
So you got to just you're now part of the county and you know that there's some concerns on State Street with five big cracks in them.

458
00:53:16,140 --> 00:53:23,650
What are you going to do to start the prevention? I know your answer would be quite.

459
00:53:28,170 --> 00:53:34,870
Would be the first thing. But.

460
00:53:36,220 --> 00:53:39,390
Okay, so now I have to give you a tissue.

461
00:53:41,560 --> 00:53:44,740
Since I don't. Hmm.

462
00:53:48,220 --> 00:53:55,060
What would you do? I don't want a tissue. What would you do?

463
00:53:56,550 --> 00:54:06,510
If there's five cracks in the sidewalk near the county manager to prevent someone getting an injury.

464
00:54:08,490 --> 00:54:16,230
One of the things you think you do. In the next meeting that I saw five cracks in the sidewalk and you fix it.

465
00:54:18,510 --> 00:54:33,160
So let me. You. Look at different options to fix the cracks, contract with vendors and see columns as well.

466
00:54:33,910 --> 00:54:41,560
So I'm I'm actually a citizen of your city and walking down State Street and I see five cracks.

467
00:54:44,640 --> 00:54:52,650
Get someone to get wax spray paint to identify that this section of the sidewalk has cracks on its outline.

468
00:54:52,650 --> 00:55:01,380
That put up some barriers that people have to walk around that area and the orange cones or orange cones.

469
00:55:01,920 --> 00:55:13,960
So what I saw was people at multiple stages in a process, thinking through risk of that sidewalk, which all the answers were fine.

470
00:55:14,550 --> 00:55:22,050
It's just if I'm the person that's at risk and you're in my city, I'm a liability and I know it's there.

471
00:55:22,140 --> 00:55:25,890
What can I do in the beginning? From the beginning to prevent that?

472
00:55:26,640 --> 00:55:32,580
And that's some of the questioning I'm hoping that that you guys will go through in that regard.

473
00:55:32,580 --> 00:55:40,860
So thank you for your answers. But thinking through immediately, if you haven't got the if you don't have a vendor, it's just been identified.

474
00:55:41,610 --> 00:55:48,479
But what do you do? Or you find out that you've got a box of bad needles in your medical assistance.

475
00:55:48,480 --> 00:55:51,640
Are telling you that. You know what?

476
00:55:51,650 --> 00:55:55,200
They can't draw blood. What?

477
00:55:55,890 --> 00:55:58,910
That's. That's risk. That's risk to you.

478
00:55:58,920 --> 00:56:03,690
It's riskier organization. It's riskier to your management style is risk to your effectiveness.

479
00:56:05,370 --> 00:56:09,420
What would you do first if you found.

480
00:56:10,790 --> 00:56:16,260
But you had a box of bad needles. Supply.

481
00:56:17,510 --> 00:56:21,440
Knowing what's at risk, because that's a known risk.

482
00:56:21,710 --> 00:56:28,590
Once it becomes known to you. Now responsible for our clinic.

483
00:56:29,070 --> 00:56:35,639
You're sitting in your office. Your staff comes to you and said, Oh, yeah, these butterfly needles are not contracting.

484
00:56:35,640 --> 00:56:41,100
There is something wrong. What would you do? Yet.

485
00:56:41,130 --> 00:56:46,200
Patient load physicians waiting on. It's a lot of risk.

486
00:56:50,100 --> 00:56:58,450
You bet. You got to like mark them so that it's known that those are bad as well as try to find replacements.

487
00:56:58,450 --> 00:57:04,839
And if there aren't any outside, maybe kind of as soon as you can speak to the supplier or whoever where you get

488
00:57:04,840 --> 00:57:08,140
the needles from to get replacements in and make sure it doesn't happen again.

489
00:57:10,910 --> 00:57:13,910
In that ID check knowledge.

490
00:57:14,720 --> 00:57:18,820
Think about acknowledge. What are you going to acknowledge? First is happening.

491
00:57:20,430 --> 00:57:25,440
You know what the potential consequences are. What can you do in that moment to take care?

492
00:57:26,280 --> 00:57:28,530
For sure. Did you have anything else you wanted to add to that?

493
00:57:28,660 --> 00:57:35,070
Yeah, I was just going to say take inventory in stock of like when those needles were manufactured like this,

494
00:57:35,100 --> 00:57:40,049
like the batch that they were part of, because there might be more boxes identified that are also bad needles.

495
00:57:40,050 --> 00:57:44,400
So and then, you know, some of the stuff that they sell, it continues in the box.

496
00:57:44,730 --> 00:57:54,960
So it's different things like, as you mentioned, where you can transfer that to the nursing supervisor and say, give me a report.

497
00:57:55,990 --> 00:58:00,190
I mean, that's I'm hands on. So I would go in that way.

498
00:58:00,200 --> 00:58:06,490
But you could transfer that in health care risk management handling complaints to minimize risks.

499
00:58:11,550 --> 00:58:16,740
And reporting an incident of risk.

500
00:58:17,280 --> 00:58:24,810
Right. Again, it's not consistent coming to you, which just document that there's still has to be an understanding of the data.

501
00:58:25,110 --> 00:58:28,990
Right. Because that's going to help you with the analysis is going to help you with your information.

502
00:58:29,780 --> 00:58:36,540
So applying that risk management process information that we shared to h.r.

503
00:58:36,960 --> 00:58:41,070
And this is regarding some things regarding recruitment, retention and retirement.

504
00:58:41,370 --> 00:58:47,550
When we think about risks in h.r. Specifically, we think about.

505
00:58:48,880 --> 00:58:59,380
Compensation and benefits. There can be some financial abuse that's at risk, some literal benefits that could put us at risk.

506
00:58:59,650 --> 00:59:03,400
And so what are the considerations? Who has signing authority?

507
00:59:04,950 --> 00:59:12,960
For putting in benefits and compensation plans. Because if I'm the director of payroll and I have no one looking over my shoulder

508
00:59:13,230 --> 00:59:17,640
and I've got friends that want to get paid more and nobody's watching me.

509
00:59:21,190 --> 00:59:25,510
Risk stress. How many signatures are required?

510
00:59:25,540 --> 00:59:29,230
Are there checks and balances? Compensation and benefits. Hiring.

511
00:59:29,710 --> 00:59:36,780
Discriminatory practices. When we think about other, we just tend to think it's transactional is what we're hearing.

512
00:59:37,200 --> 00:59:42,140
But that transactional could actually put you at risk if it's discriminatory.

513
00:59:42,150 --> 00:59:48,870
We know about EEOC and different types of hiring rules, but there can be some wrongful hiring.

514
00:59:48,870 --> 00:59:58,920
We are currently increasing and investing in our talent acquisition and management staff right now to ensure that we recruit.

515
00:59:59,100 --> 01:00:10,230
It's an investment we're willing to make because we don't want to have employees coming in some capacity that could jeopardize or risk the university.

516
01:00:12,500 --> 01:00:19,680
Potential considerations to mitigate that risk. Was a complete screening completed on the potential person being hired?

517
01:00:19,970 --> 01:00:27,490
Did we wait for the drug results? Where provincial human rights laws observed.

518
01:00:27,670 --> 01:00:32,990
Is there a set up? Is there a probationary period so that we can mitigate our risk right up front?

519
01:00:33,010 --> 01:00:42,970
These are some of the things we think about in H.R. Did the employees sign off on the policies and contract of employment before being hired?

520
01:00:44,860 --> 01:00:50,410
I am curious what your fellowships will have you sign off on.

521
01:00:51,250 --> 01:00:54,250
You are new to their organization.

522
01:00:54,970 --> 01:00:58,840
You will be responsible for probably some major projects.

523
01:00:59,500 --> 01:01:06,010
They are putting their investment in you, but they're also putting some things at risk with you.

524
01:01:06,040 --> 01:01:10,120
So what are you signing off because of that?

525
01:01:13,440 --> 01:01:18,390
Questions that are being asked. Occupational Health and Safety.

526
01:01:18,630 --> 01:01:24,060
Occupational health and safety is usually the medical clinic for employees.

527
01:01:25,020 --> 01:01:29,040
Neal Six Falls Workers Comp. So are you going to go get evaluated?

528
01:01:30,060 --> 01:01:39,420
Just wanted to get that information, but potential risks are environmental factors, personal injury or death on the job?

529
01:01:44,920 --> 01:01:50,620
It's public knowledge. COVID killed some of our employees on the job.

530
01:01:53,540 --> 01:01:57,319
Risk. Risk we took. Risk.

531
01:01:57,320 --> 01:02:02,540
The employee took risk, risk, risk. What can we have done to mitigate it?

532
01:02:03,020 --> 01:02:10,850
Things that we did. I know we put in place and provide safe working conditions and conduct safety checks.

533
01:02:14,550 --> 01:02:18,890
Did we provide adequate training for the staff? How do you train for it?

534
01:02:21,630 --> 01:02:25,650
Do we ensure the use of appropriate clothing and safety equipment?

535
01:02:25,980 --> 01:02:37,530
Again, all the things in mitigating risk. And one of the things I will share is that my husband worked in the steel mill for 40 years.

536
01:02:38,460 --> 01:02:41,930
And hot, hot Midnight Guy.

537
01:02:41,940 --> 01:02:48,209
And he was not allergic. He did metallurgy, the steel that was being produced.

538
01:02:48,210 --> 01:02:55,920
So what you know, the soft steel versus the hard steel versus steels for pop bottles versus steel for cars and.

539
01:02:57,210 --> 01:03:02,970
Ensuring that they have the right equipment to work with the molten lava, to go in and work with that molten lava.

540
01:03:03,810 --> 01:03:09,960
Men died in this place and they risk their lives every day for that employer.

541
01:03:09,990 --> 01:03:15,180
What can we do to help mitigate that risk of those men dying?

542
01:03:16,650 --> 01:03:19,900
Lots and lots and lots of accreditations and.

543
01:03:22,260 --> 01:03:26,909
Rules that needed to be followed in how they actually introduce themselves into their own

544
01:03:26,910 --> 01:03:30,630
work environment and then how they introduce themselves out of the work environment.

545
01:03:31,930 --> 01:03:41,160
That is very similar to a surgeon. Going in, having to wash their hands so that you don't risk contaminating.

546
01:03:41,790 --> 01:03:49,620
And so if you relax that as a leader and saying, oh, he's never had any issues with his surgeries and have to wash his hands.

547
01:03:50,850 --> 01:04:02,250
It has happened. I have had my nursing friends in hospitals tell me that they are seen as someone who is just the rule follower.

548
01:04:03,250 --> 01:04:11,790
And it's like. But what's that risk being an infection in the surgical site?

549
01:04:12,950 --> 01:04:17,280
And then every single time this is an issue and what's the it could be?

550
01:04:17,630 --> 01:04:24,320
So yeah, someone has to enforce that to keep the risk level in what that looks like.

551
01:04:24,320 --> 01:04:31,760
But how you introduce how that surgeon introduces himself to the surgery and then how they introduce themselves when they come out of that surgery,

552
01:04:32,030 --> 01:04:40,429
what are they doing to mitigate that risk? What do you know when you're managing your clinics or your practices or places that you're going to be in?

553
01:04:40,430 --> 01:04:45,110
What is introduced as a risk and what's an outgoing risk is kind of what I mean.

554
01:04:45,500 --> 01:04:48,650
So that's recruitment from a retention standpoint.

555
01:04:50,090 --> 01:04:54,650
So with we've we have the employee inside and they've been here for ten or 15 years.

556
01:04:56,090 --> 01:05:00,560
What's at risk for those employees? We tend to think in terms of employee supervision.

557
01:05:02,850 --> 01:05:12,989
Reputation in the community, meaning we could possibly have employees who speak ill of us in the community,

558
01:05:12,990 --> 01:05:21,420
and therefore nobody wants to come and be hired there. And what are what can we do to reduce that release of personal information?

559
01:05:22,720 --> 01:05:30,280
Meaning supervisors in. And over medical records and HIPA information releasing.

560
01:05:31,530 --> 01:05:35,160
And putting the university or the hospital at risk.

561
01:05:35,220 --> 01:05:43,410
Those are the abuses that could potentially occur. And to mitigate those things, do we provide sufficient sufficient orientation?

562
01:05:43,410 --> 01:05:52,230
Do we provide adequate supervision, especially for activities that occur offsite or after hours, because there sometimes will be third shifts?

563
01:05:53,570 --> 01:05:57,470
Did the medical staff you work in?

564
01:05:57,490 --> 01:06:03,020
H You're working normally at 7 to 7 if you're working in health care clinics,

565
01:06:04,340 --> 01:06:11,390
closed down the clinic at seven and they left out some needles that the janitor seemed to have.

566
01:06:13,740 --> 01:06:17,550
Contracted there with you do not risk. It's now your risk.

567
01:06:18,210 --> 01:06:21,510
Looking at the full picture. The full the full, full boat of it.

568
01:06:22,620 --> 01:06:27,650
What what do we what have we put in place about what their performance needs to be?

569
01:06:27,660 --> 01:06:32,880
What what is it that they need to aspire to? What do they need to do in order to mitigate those risks?

570
01:06:34,500 --> 01:06:39,450
Employee conduct. There can be abuse and again, reputation in the community.

571
01:06:39,450 --> 01:06:43,730
Do we clearly have written a protection note?

572
01:06:43,750 --> 01:06:47,399
We have written descriptions for all our positions.

573
01:06:47,400 --> 01:06:57,750
Do they know exactly what they're doing? True story that there are employees who will want to come.

574
01:06:59,270 --> 01:07:02,360
So we're trying. We're.

575
01:07:03,570 --> 01:07:06,990
On drugs. You can look at the statistics.

576
01:07:07,680 --> 01:07:11,280
Most hospitals, especially with the pressures on our clinical staff,

577
01:07:12,570 --> 01:07:18,720
will have a certain percentage of those employees coming to work under the influence.

578
01:07:19,700 --> 01:07:24,650
Could be your staff. What are you going to do? How do you mitigate that?

579
01:07:24,980 --> 01:07:32,850
What rules are you following? I mean, I can help, but what are you doing to control that?

580
01:07:35,980 --> 01:07:41,139
Do you have an employee handbook managing the cancer center practice?

581
01:07:41,140 --> 01:07:46,540
Because it was an individual practice, they didn't think they needed a handbook with a staff of 40.

582
01:07:47,440 --> 01:07:50,860
First thing I did was say, Nope, we need to have an employee handbook.

583
01:07:51,400 --> 01:07:57,580
Can't do it. And all staff meeting. 50 pages later, everybody's on the same page.

584
01:07:58,420 --> 01:08:05,590
And it started to reduce some of the risks associated that were in that particular clinic and our practice.

585
01:08:08,590 --> 01:08:13,720
Do we ensure the organization, the organizational value valuables are secure?

586
01:08:16,030 --> 01:08:26,410
I have a laptop issued by the university. And they should want to know what I'm doing, where it's at.

587
01:08:27,010 --> 01:08:33,910
How do I count for it? Because something that puts you some things at an on my computer.

588
01:08:34,780 --> 01:08:38,620
The university is at risk for that. Literally at risk for that.

589
01:08:38,860 --> 01:08:43,680
So what are you doing? Because you're always gonna say, Why are you snooping in my stuff?

590
01:08:43,690 --> 01:08:45,490
Isn't that my computer that you issued to me?

591
01:08:46,570 --> 01:08:57,040
But it's we all know it's employer property, but you're still at risk for what that person does on this on that particular computer.

592
01:08:58,140 --> 01:09:12,000
That's retention, Richard. Retaining termination and retirement, ending, ending exiting employees and getting that property back.

593
01:09:12,360 --> 01:09:22,439
So you are now in a hybrid, flexible work environment and your staff wants to work from home and they have all the ergonomic needs they've had.

594
01:09:22,440 --> 01:09:30,000
They have a desk, they have a chair, they have a computer and said, I'm not coming in anymore.

595
01:09:31,970 --> 01:09:35,630
Then their personal house. That's their house.

596
01:09:35,640 --> 01:09:39,470
Their property. How do you get your property back?

597
01:09:39,500 --> 01:09:44,980
What? What have you put in place to reduce that risk of them saying, I'm just going to keep and I want to get back to.

598
01:09:47,550 --> 01:09:51,880
I'm glad it's in my hands. I didn't. And they call the cops on you.

599
01:09:53,140 --> 01:09:57,680
Employer. What have you. Have you thought that through?

600
01:09:58,680 --> 01:10:02,880
What that might look like, what you are agreeing to.

601
01:10:05,030 --> 01:10:11,749
Before you take that risk and giving them property to to to take home some of the things we can do to mitigate that.

602
01:10:11,750 --> 01:10:18,380
Do you retrieve organizational information and equipment that a dismissed employee used, especially from both?

603
01:10:19,580 --> 01:10:23,540
Putting that right out there. This is what we will do. This is what you will sign off on.

604
01:10:23,540 --> 01:10:27,590
This is what will happen within hours. We'll send you the box.

605
01:10:27,620 --> 01:10:32,860
You can ship it back to us. It'll it will be at our expense, etc., etc.

606
01:10:34,920 --> 01:10:38,710
Reputation in the community. And do we secure?

607
01:10:38,760 --> 01:10:44,220
Do we ensure that all access codes and passwords, etc. are deactivated?

608
01:10:47,300 --> 01:10:52,550
Has happened. It wasn't an h.r.

609
01:10:52,550 --> 01:11:00,140
Person employee leaves has access to information because they were in good standing.

610
01:11:01,880 --> 01:11:07,190
Waited 24. Actually, it was 72 hours prior to cutting off.

611
01:11:09,100 --> 01:11:16,270
And. No, there wasn't a non-compete.

612
01:11:18,190 --> 01:11:26,800
Information shared. And competitor had a leg up based on information we were to when that.

613
01:11:26,830 --> 01:11:32,830
So not only what compensation do we conduct an exit interview?

614
01:11:33,100 --> 01:11:36,400
Has anybody completed themselves an exit interview?

615
01:11:36,780 --> 01:11:39,860
So anybody in the class had Nixon. Yeah.

616
01:11:40,460 --> 01:11:44,630
What kind of questions did they ask? Experience.

617
01:11:44,810 --> 01:11:49,680
How was your experience? I was. I was, like going elsewhere or something.

618
01:11:49,700 --> 01:11:53,000
Why were you leaving? Are you. Where? Okay.

619
01:11:55,100 --> 01:12:07,550
And it is oftentimes. The employer says it's a great idea to do an exit interview and tell you the person sitting in front of the person leaving.

620
01:12:08,060 --> 01:12:16,430
When it gets down to the that level that your employer would like for you to interview a medical assistant that is upset.

621
01:12:17,390 --> 01:12:20,930
Still would like for you to interview a physician that is upset.

622
01:12:21,210 --> 01:12:24,650
I would like for you to interview a nurse that is upset.

623
01:12:25,280 --> 01:12:27,620
It's going to feel uncomfortable.

624
01:12:27,620 --> 01:12:38,449
But you're still getting data that you can utilize because if seven people are upset and they're leaving, what's at risk?

625
01:12:38,450 --> 01:12:43,910
Your patient care? It's information you want to know. So it's you understand what you can fix.

626
01:12:49,150 --> 01:12:51,070
Step five, monitoring and control.

627
01:12:52,570 --> 01:13:02,530
So when we went through the multicolored boxes, we're at the monitoring and control portion and keeping track and updating your risk plan,

628
01:13:02,530 --> 01:13:06,700
ensuring execution of risk plans, communicating the status.

629
01:13:06,700 --> 01:13:09,790
Revisiting assumptions. Making changes to the initiative plan.

630
01:13:09,970 --> 01:13:17,260
Lessons Learned for Future Initiatives. We are very close to the lessons learned on the initiatives when it comes to colored.

631
01:13:17,680 --> 01:13:24,880
Right now we are constantly turning over what we could have done different, but all along, keeping track of what we've done,

632
01:13:26,320 --> 01:13:31,870
ensuring that we executed what we wanted to when it comes to that, to the risks that we wanted to to take.

633
01:13:32,350 --> 01:13:39,780
Definitely communicating the status of. What the outcomes were based on what we put in.

634
01:13:41,350 --> 01:13:53,150
You know how many hospitalizations. And for this particular slide, when you take a risk and I think you've heard us talk about it before,

635
01:13:53,160 --> 01:13:59,420
especially I think with Denise, there's usually three things at risk when you're trying to shift or move the needle.

636
01:13:59,420 --> 01:14:04,310
It's either going to be cost. Quality access.

637
01:14:06,770 --> 01:14:11,550
That's one of those one of those needles are going to move and.

638
01:14:14,620 --> 01:14:25,750
So at this point, we are I'm going to be probably in 5 minutes early, but truly wanted to thank you for going through this risk assessment for me.

639
01:14:26,380 --> 01:14:33,100
And as someone who is concerned about so now you have an answer of a final is going to file is going to be online or in person.

640
01:14:33,790 --> 01:14:46,629
So thank you for that. And I want to do some chocolates for you if you like chocolate for doing it, for being the first thing you do to accept that.

641
01:14:46,630 --> 01:14:59,410
So thank you for that. I think you guys, there's no assignment this week, so it's not coming in time.

642
01:14:59,410 --> 01:15:12,180
And I am not targeting Justin Bieber.

643
01:15:15,820 --> 01:15:25,030
No, that's I think that's the thing.

644
01:15:25,120 --> 01:15:28,510
And it's really important to more than one site.

645
01:15:29,690 --> 01:15:34,300
I think, you know, I think we have to do it.

646
01:15:34,630 --> 01:15:39,330
And I think I hope it was fun for you.

647
01:15:40,440 --> 01:15:47,630
My data right now, it's it's not happening.

648
01:15:49,330 --> 01:15:51,070
And it would have been okay if you did.

649
01:15:51,100 --> 01:16:02,530
And that's also a lesson when you're in leadership, you need to come forward and try to hold you to their own standards.

650
01:16:02,530 --> 01:16:05,620
But at the same point in time, because they were confusing.

651
01:16:06,320 --> 01:16:18,430
So I definitely would stick with trying to find the other point that was that I was not support because the chocolate.

652
01:16:18,430 --> 01:16:24,850
That's so nice of you. You know I guess I am all set to share or leave.

653
01:16:25,270 --> 01:16:35,080
I'll give it to Dawson. Class students need to do it because she was very nice.

654
01:16:36,060 --> 01:16:42,820
But I'm not because it's because it's nice. Mrs. Julia So who are some of the comments from others?

655
01:16:43,640 --> 01:16:55,870
But I wanted to talk to you because I'm usually here on Thursday, but I can usually get here around 11.

656
01:16:56,000 --> 01:17:00,010
Stay or you can I could split my time.

657
01:17:00,010 --> 01:17:11,110
So if you need to just give us an idea here, some days I'm available and then I can squeeze you in and we can meet or whatever school.

658
01:17:11,140 --> 01:17:17,330
Yeah, because I'm not here, but in here.

659
01:17:18,140 --> 01:17:21,220
Okay. Yeah. I don't really want to stay connected otherwise.

660
01:17:21,310 --> 01:17:25,090
Absolutely. What was that, a fun exercise or not? Yeah.

661
01:17:25,300 --> 01:17:29,110
Kind of hiring and firing.

662
01:17:29,110 --> 01:17:34,389
Just me. Yeah. Imagine a leader. I mean, you were tiring and she was pulling out tissue.

663
01:17:34,390 --> 01:17:41,550
Yeah. I'm telling you, leaders are in and that worn out and absent.

664
01:17:42,040 --> 01:17:47,470
Imagine that pressure on you. But if you can plan for things and you can put some things in place,

665
01:17:48,760 --> 01:17:52,240
you get a little bit of a breather because it's not going to come back to you as hard.

666
01:17:52,930 --> 01:17:56,770
What can you do so it doesn't come back at you as hard? We take a risk, right?

667
01:17:57,040 --> 01:18:02,980
Yeah. I can put $10,000 in the the the dollar slot or I can put $2.

668
01:18:03,100 --> 01:18:12,070
Right. It's not going to back at me, you know, with $2 will come back at me because I lost in for if I try to make that make sense.

669
01:18:13,340 --> 01:18:21,020
All right. Now, you know, of course, the terrible, horrible ending.

670
01:18:21,530 --> 01:18:28,310
I wish I could have won that Powerball. Somebody in California, $10 billion is just a happy, happy person.

671
01:18:28,490 --> 01:18:31,940
And I heard they gave the guy who sold the ticket $1,000,000.

672
01:18:32,330 --> 01:18:35,480
Oh, yes. The gas station.

673
01:18:35,990 --> 01:18:41,890
Oh, my God. Yes, sir. No, sorry.

674
01:18:42,380 --> 01:18:48,680
No, no. Your God. What do you mean? So I know the finals are going to be online, but then so I'm.

675
01:18:48,680 --> 01:18:54,770
My tickets are booked for December ten, and I don't think my Internet connection is going to be stable.

676
01:18:54,980 --> 01:18:58,460
I'm in India, so is there a way I can take it just a few days earlier?

677
01:18:59,390 --> 01:19:02,990
I'm not a fan of that. I'm going to be honest. I am. All right.

678
01:19:02,990 --> 01:19:10,010
I can I can keep working with you. We we connect on and off, on and off until you can get on and do it.

679
01:19:10,400 --> 01:19:13,590
But I am I'm a fan of everybody doing it together. Okay.

680
01:19:14,120 --> 01:19:18,260
Being on screen online. But you've got to log off and on and off and on.

681
01:19:18,440 --> 01:19:26,510
I will do that for you. I just it's hard for me to start making that exception because watching it, it doesn't go well.

682
01:19:26,900 --> 01:19:31,760
