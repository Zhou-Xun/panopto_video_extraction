1
00:00:01,040 --> 00:00:05,491
Okay, so I'm Sarah Standard, I am the director of the Education and

2
00:00:05,491 --> 00:00:10,346
Training corps for the University of Michigan injury prevention center.

3
00:00:10,346 --> 00:00:13,541
I'm also a faculty member in the school of nursing and

4
00:00:13,541 --> 00:00:17,446
in the school public health health behavior health education and

5
00:00:17,446 --> 00:00:20,436
I'm going to talk about the injury certificate.

6
00:00:20,436 --> 00:00:24,385
So I'll try to go, I have formal slides and

7
00:00:24,385 --> 00:00:30,198
we do have our session that will go more in depth into it as well,

8
00:00:30,198 --> 00:00:34,057
is Tuesday september 11th at two p.m.

9
00:00:34,057 --> 00:00:37,334
I'll kind of run through these rather quickly because I know we want to cover

10
00:00:37,334 --> 00:00:38,521
a lot of the certificates.

11
00:00:38,521 --> 00:00:41,538
But so if you're interested, what is injury?

12
00:00:41,538 --> 00:00:46,377
Injury actually kind of a little bit broader than maybe what

13
00:00:46,377 --> 00:00:49,570
we often think injury of including so

14
00:00:49,570 --> 00:00:54,215
you can see substance abuse opioid kind of overdose and

15
00:00:54,215 --> 00:00:58,858
use is included in that, I mean it's older adult falls,

16
00:00:58,858 --> 00:01:02,870
it's emergency response to kind of disasters.

17
00:01:02,870 --> 00:01:07,363
It's really broad, all of my work really is around substance use and

18
00:01:07,363 --> 00:01:11,800
violence and that's kind of part of the kind of the injury that I do.

19
00:01:11,800 --> 00:01:16,229
But you can see that it's really quite broad including like motor vehicle crashes

20
00:01:16,229 --> 00:01:17,240
as well.

21
00:01:17,240 --> 00:01:18,850
Why do we care about injury?

22
00:01:18,850 --> 00:01:21,688
Injury is the leading cause of death for

23
00:01:21,688 --> 00:01:27,278
anyone under the age of 44 you can I don't need to read you the stats there but

24
00:01:27,278 --> 00:01:32,094
there's a significant amount of money as well that's spent on and

25
00:01:32,094 --> 00:01:37,082
injury every year and that's in the acute kind of case of injury, but

26
00:01:37,082 --> 00:01:42,242
then also the long term consequences for some injuries kind of injuries

27
00:01:42,242 --> 00:01:48,262
regarding violence or maybe motor vehicle related injuries, those things can add

28
00:01:48,262 --> 00:01:54,140
up to cost in kind of economic loss and those kinds of things over time.

29
00:01:54,140 --> 00:01:57,360
So here you can see kind of how it's broken down.

30
00:01:57,360 --> 00:02:00,410
You can see the blue is unintentional injury.

31
00:02:00,410 --> 00:02:04,171
And that's the leading cause of death really, like I said for

32
00:02:04,171 --> 00:02:08,030
all those groups except for under 40 for except for infants.

33
00:02:08,030 --> 00:02:13,294
And then you can see suicide there in green homicide in red.

34
00:02:13,294 --> 00:02:20,146
So, for those in the age group that I work most closely with 15-24 year olds,

35
00:02:20,146 --> 00:02:27,940
the leading causes of injury or death really are related to injury.

36
00:02:27,940 --> 00:02:32,880
So a little bit about the injury center where CDC funded center,

37
00:02:32,880 --> 00:02:35,190
one of 10 centers in the US.

38
00:02:35,190 --> 00:02:38,331
Our overall center director is Rebecca Cunningham,

39
00:02:38,331 --> 00:02:40,580
she's an emergency room physician.

40
00:02:40,580 --> 00:02:44,978
And then Cleopatra caldwell is also a faculty member in the School of

41
00:02:44,978 --> 00:02:52,140
Public health and she is also involved in the training and education core.

42
00:02:52,140 --> 00:02:55,440
So we have a really a team approach to injury prevention,

43
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:57,378
it's very interdisciplinary.

44
00:02:57,378 --> 00:03:02,185
Our center is, we have faculty and researchers from all over campus that

45
00:03:02,185 --> 00:03:07,148
participate in the injury center in different capacities and kind of focused

46
00:03:07,148 --> 00:03:12,188
on different topics are injury center that different injuries centres around

47
00:03:12,188 --> 00:03:17,580
the country have a little bit different focus are okay and some are really broad.

48
00:03:17,580 --> 00:03:19,369
Others are very specific,

49
00:03:19,369 --> 00:03:24,658
like there's one center that really is only focused on suicide were broader, so

50
00:03:24,658 --> 00:03:30,130
are kind of work, we do quite a bit around opioid, overdose, opioid prevention.

51
00:03:30,130 --> 00:03:34,101
We there's a component around young drivers safety

52
00:03:34,101 --> 00:03:37,140
through the transportation institute.

53
00:03:37,140 --> 00:03:41,490
A lot of us do work around violence and then there's,

54
00:03:41,490 --> 00:03:45,163
we have a fair amount on sports concussions,

55
00:03:45,163 --> 00:03:49,916
sports injuries and then some on campus sexual violence.

56
00:03:49,916 --> 00:03:56,066
We do a little bit around suicide, we do a little bit around older adult falls, so

57
00:03:56,066 --> 00:04:02,134
you can see we have faculty that kind of cover a broad range of injury interests.

58
00:04:02,134 --> 00:04:06,198
So the center offers a number of different kind of teaching and

59
00:04:06,198 --> 00:04:09,580
learning opportunities to students and faculty.

60
00:04:09,580 --> 00:04:14,350
We do quarterly lunchtime seminars, we provide lunch.

61
00:04:14,350 --> 00:04:19,503
Usually the seminars are delivered by people on campus, either faculty or

62
00:04:19,503 --> 00:04:24,492
some of our like postdoctoral fellows or researchers that are doing

63
00:04:24,492 --> 00:04:29,280
kind of research that is, may be of interest to those of us on campus.

64
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:32,117
We have a quarterly distinguished faculty seminar and

65
00:04:32,117 --> 00:04:35,280
that's usually where we bring someone in from the outside.

66
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:40,340
Really kind of a distinguished expert in an area of injury.

67
00:04:40,340 --> 00:04:43,201
We do a number of different webinars and workshops.

68
00:04:43,201 --> 00:04:46,920
We have a core that really is the statistics and methods core.

69
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:50,605
They sometimes do kind of different workshops and

70
00:04:50,605 --> 00:04:54,375
we offer a variety of things different symposia and

71
00:04:54,375 --> 00:04:59,726
then we're involved with conferences, both regional conferences and

72
00:04:59,726 --> 00:05:04,741
then every few years we do kind of our own conference more on campus.

73
00:05:04,741 --> 00:05:08,566
So, as far as kind of training specific activities,

74
00:05:08,566 --> 00:05:12,731
we have the certificate program, we offer internships,

75
00:05:12,731 --> 00:05:17,930
we do have typically some funding for summer internships for students.

76
00:05:17,930 --> 00:05:23,577
Those announcements go out in kind of late fall semester, usually we try to have them

77
00:05:23,577 --> 00:05:28,940
out by November, December, so you can work on applications over the break.

78
00:05:28,940 --> 00:05:34,540
And, we, this year I think funded six summer interns.

79
00:05:34,540 --> 00:05:37,984
And then we do have postdoctoral fellowships.

80
00:05:37,984 --> 00:05:42,272
We also released a massive online course in May of this

81
00:05:42,272 --> 00:05:46,010
year focused on child and adolescent injury.

82
00:05:46,010 --> 00:05:50,378
And so that's available and actually that's really available for

83
00:05:50,378 --> 00:05:52,040
free through Fedex.

84
00:05:52,040 --> 00:05:56,603
If anyone's interested in learning more broadly about kind of child and

85
00:05:56,603 --> 00:05:59,240
adolescent injury.

86
00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:04,230
So the goal of the certificate program you can read really is to engage

87
00:06:04,230 --> 00:06:09,480
students in kind of injury in kind of different aspects of learning about

88
00:06:09,480 --> 00:06:14,642
injury in a sense and, so policies around injury kind of statistics and

89
00:06:14,642 --> 00:06:16,910
methods for studying injury.

90
00:06:16,910 --> 00:06:22,440
Interventions, a number of our faculty to intervention work, okay.

91
00:06:22,440 --> 00:06:27,100
So our certificate program requires, it's 12-13 credit hours.

92
00:06:27,100 --> 00:06:30,273
There's the it looks a little different if you're

93
00:06:30,273 --> 00:06:33,455
an mph student versus a non mph students, really.

94
00:06:33,455 --> 00:06:37,740
Again, any grad student on campus can participate in the certificate.

95
00:06:37,740 --> 00:06:44,500
So for all students there's two core courses and then to elective courses.

96
00:06:44,500 --> 00:06:49,711
And then there's a practicum which typically has done over the summer and

97
00:06:49,711 --> 00:06:56,640
can count as your required summer internship for your program.

98
00:06:56,640 --> 00:07:01,268
So like I said all students take two core courses we've had

99
00:07:01,268 --> 00:07:06,180
a couple of courses will not be offered this academic year, so

100
00:07:06,180 --> 00:07:11,580
we kind of have supplemented or kind of offered some other options.

101
00:07:11,580 --> 00:07:16,773
One the 2nd one 644 I'll actually be doing and it's if you want to do our

102
00:07:16,773 --> 00:07:22,049
online book, you can register for credits through the independent study,

103
00:07:22,049 --> 00:07:27,012
you'll do the mocks with me and probably some additional activities.

104
00:07:27,012 --> 00:07:29,741
But that can count as one of the core courses.

105
00:07:29,741 --> 00:07:34,825
And then I listed one other here that's been typically offered in the winter.

106
00:07:34,825 --> 00:07:38,922
I would say anyone who is really interested in doing it, well one come to

107
00:07:38,922 --> 00:07:43,358
the other session but then to contact me, my email address is on the website,

108
00:07:43,358 --> 00:07:46,934
the certificate website and it's usually good to talk to me.

109
00:07:46,934 --> 00:07:50,680
I had a time and just give me an idea of what you're thinking and

110
00:07:50,680 --> 00:07:55,074
then I can kind of help make sure that you're taking courses that will for

111
00:07:55,074 --> 00:07:57,260
sure meet what we're looking for.

112
00:07:57,260 --> 00:08:01,336
Also check the your internship kind of run that past me if you're

113
00:08:01,336 --> 00:08:05,035
really wanting to count that for an injury certificate and

114
00:08:05,035 --> 00:08:09,713
I can just make sure that it will fit and like I said injuries pretty broad so

115
00:08:09,713 --> 00:08:13,211
if it is all related to injury it probably will be fine.

116
00:08:13,211 --> 00:08:17,521
But just to check ahead so we're not disappointed later if I say no.

117
00:08:17,521 --> 00:08:23,653
[LAUGH] So, again, for the non mph students that there's two electives and

118
00:08:23,653 --> 00:08:29,494
that's pretty open and broad for the mph students there to electives,

119
00:08:29,494 --> 00:08:33,992
but they cannot be required courses for your program.

120
00:08:33,992 --> 00:08:38,983
So that's also where we just need to make sure that it can

121
00:08:38,983 --> 00:08:43,335
count as the bank of electives that you take, but

122
00:08:43,335 --> 00:08:48,240
it can't be required course and then the internship.

123
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:54,204
I don't need to go over your knowledge, expectations,

124
00:08:54,204 --> 00:08:59,299
skills, any questions because I know I'm going

125
00:08:59,299 --> 00:09:03,788
into the next time, any questions at all?

126
00:09:03,788 --> 00:09:07,942
That I hope if you might be interested in injury, there's also,

127
00:09:07,942 --> 00:09:13,005
if you're looking for kind of research experiences, kind of research, maybe

128
00:09:13,005 --> 00:09:18,066
employment there are, reach out to us because there are faculty that typically

129
00:09:18,066 --> 00:09:22,480
do hire students to work on projects as well in a variety of the areas.

130
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:27,941
So, please come on September 11, and we can talk more about it and otherwise

131
00:09:27,941 --> 00:09:33,936
feel free to email me, and I'm happy to respond to questions that way, too.
