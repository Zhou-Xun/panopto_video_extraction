00:00:06,900 --> 00:00:11,980
Welcome to Epit, 634 is module on the reproductive number.

2
00:00:11,980 --> 00:00:17,310
In this module, I will formally introduced the concept of the reproductive number.

3
00:00:17,310 --> 00:00:24,920
This is an important statistic in transmission. Modeling is quickly becoming an important sophistic genetic genealogy.

4
00:00:24,920 --> 00:00:32,200
The learning objectives of this module are one to formulate their heuristic understanding of the reproductive number,

5
00:00:32,200 --> 00:00:42,870
and two, to apply this heuristic understanding to different transmission systems with distinct definitions of contact.

6
00:00:42,870 --> 00:00:48,570
The concept of the reproductive number was first introduced by Ladka in the 1920s as a demographic

7
00:00:48,570 --> 00:00:56,580
metric in demography are not is the product of the probability that a woman survives to A.J.,

8
00:00:56,580 --> 00:01:07,070
the reproductive age, the rate of giving birth and the age range of reproductive years.

9
00:01:07,070 --> 00:01:17,090
Based on his equation or not, is the average number of hours per individual across reproductive ages, the integral is basically swimming across ages.

10
00:01:17,090 --> 00:01:27,500
A McDonald was the first to apply this concept to epidemiology in the context of malaria transmission.

11
00:01:27,500 --> 00:01:34,830
Where are not is the product of the transmission rate, which is analogous to birth rate.

12
00:01:34,830 --> 00:01:40,640
Indeed, the disease duration. Now, if we assume that this survival probability in the lot.

13
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:50,650
Because in LA, because equation is one Pandi is analogous to DNA or the age range and lot because equation in the

14
00:01:50,650 --> 00:02:00,020
transmission context are as defined as the average number of secondary cases caused by one infectious case.

15
00:02:00,020 --> 00:02:03,910
So we can think about our not as a branching process.

16
00:02:03,910 --> 00:02:15,910
Like this illustration here in this example, we are not equals to one infectious individual passes the infection on to on average to others.

17
00:02:15,910 --> 00:02:23,380
These two then pass the infection onto two others. This continues as the infection increases exponentially.

18
00:02:23,380 --> 00:02:30,670
It's important to remember that this is this is what happens on average.

19
00:02:30,670 --> 00:02:33,700
But infection is highly heterogeneous,

20
00:02:33,700 --> 00:02:41,960
is a highly heterogeneous process and an average measure of our not is not always useful and sometimes misleading.

21
00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:48,470
We can illustrate this by observing contact data from the Saar's pandemic in 2002.

22
00:02:48,470 --> 00:02:55,970
Here we see in detail that hedgie may be the heterogeneity behind infection spread.

23
00:02:55,970 --> 00:03:02,870
We see one person person A transmitting Saar's to thirty three others.

24
00:03:02,870 --> 00:03:15,680
Most of these didn't spread Saar's to anyone else illustrated in the effort group during generation to person deed transmitted to 10 others,

25
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:24,740
whereas person G. Transmitted to only one L personnel and that person and transmitted to twelve others.

26
00:03:24,740 --> 00:03:35,250
So Steve Riley. Developed a new model of our not that explicitly counts for super spreading events specifically are not equals.

27
00:03:35,250 --> 00:03:45,030
The average are not that we've been talking about. Plus, a term that is the product of the probability.

28
00:03:45,030 --> 00:03:52,580
Have a super spending event times the number of that super spreading event.

29
00:03:52,580 --> 00:04:03,590
Let's look at an example. Here we have data on our not that there is over time in one Saar's outbreak in China by the end of the pandemic.

30
00:04:03,590 --> 00:04:10,270
The average are not was point one for.

31
00:04:10,270 --> 00:04:14,980
If the average ANA was point one for let's apply the above equation to predict what

32
00:04:14,980 --> 00:04:20,940
kind of super spreading event would be needed on average to initiate an outbreak.

33
00:04:20,940 --> 00:04:25,320
That is to increase our not to above one.

34
00:04:25,320 --> 00:04:38,280
One solution to this is that a super spreading event of 300 that occurs in one in three hundred infection events results in an hour,

35
00:04:38,280 --> 00:04:52,980
not of one point oh four. Therefore, even though the average are not as well below one, super spreading events can still sustain transmission.

36
00:04:52,980 --> 00:04:56,910
Let's review General Properties of Arnott.

37
00:04:56,910 --> 00:05:04,340
It's important to keep in mind here that are not represents the maximum reproductive potential of an infection.

38
00:05:04,340 --> 00:05:11,220
It is defined as a number of infections that results in a fully susceptible population.

39
00:05:11,220 --> 00:05:21,930
In general, the population is not fully susceptible. But this definition of our not called a basic reproductive number provides a good

40
00:05:21,930 --> 00:05:29,280
measure of the epidemic potential of a given pathogen in a given environmental setting.

41
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:40,290
So in a deterministic model are not less than one means the disease will be eliminated in are not greater than one means that the disease will grow.

42
00:05:40,290 --> 00:05:47,100
In contrast, for us as test stochastic model, the interpretation is slightly different,

43
00:05:47,100 --> 00:05:56,240
are not less than one suggests that minor outbreaks can occur, but that the probability of extinction or elimination is one.

44
00:05:56,240 --> 00:06:01,380
Are not greater than one suggests that there's a finite probability of a major outbreak,

45
00:06:01,380 --> 00:06:11,160
but also a finite probability of extinction or elimination, as we have seen earlier, for control purposes.

46
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:15,240
We need to know more than just whether or not it's greater than one.

47
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:23,580
We also need to know the magnitude of our not when or not, as is large, having or not may not reduce risk much,

48
00:06:23,580 --> 00:06:31,490
but when our not as three or less small decreases in our not can have dramatic effects on transmission.

49
00:06:31,490 --> 00:06:37,730
And we'll see. You'll see that in your labs. Finally.

50
00:06:37,730 --> 00:06:49,130
It is important to understand that the value of our not depends on a number of both biological and environmental factors, both social and ecological.

51
00:06:49,130 --> 00:06:57,290
A successful control program in one region may not be effective in another.

52
00:06:57,290 --> 00:07:04,220
We've talked about our not as a product of two and sometimes three factors here.

53
00:07:04,220 --> 00:07:15,200
We will present are not as a product of four factors. Contact rate among individuals and infectivity are the first two factors.

54
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:20,390
The product of these two factors is the transmission rate.

55
00:07:20,390 --> 00:07:27,830
The third factor is the duration of a disease. How long an individual is spreading the disease.

56
00:07:27,830 --> 00:07:38,420
The fourth factor in that is an attenuation factor. That we have seen can be due to latency period.

57
00:07:38,420 --> 00:07:47,870
It can also be due to loss of pathogens in the environment and is relevant to waterborne pathogens, foodborne pathogens and vector borne pathogens.

58
00:07:47,870 --> 00:07:58,590
So in review, transmission has a social and a biological component and comprises of the first two terms of our NOT.

59
00:07:58,590 --> 00:08:08,610
Contact rates are often characterized through social networks. Infectivity is a function of both the host and the pathogen.

60
00:08:08,610 --> 00:08:14,120
The duration of disease. Is.

61
00:08:14,120 --> 00:08:19,370
One over the rate of recovery. And as I mentioned.

62
00:08:19,370 --> 00:08:30,010
Earlier attenuation can be due to latency within the host or die off within the environment.

63
00:08:30,010 --> 00:08:37,230
How do we define contact? That depends on the type of transmission system.

64
00:08:37,230 --> 00:08:46,310
For a sexually transmitted disease, contact is often defined as a number of different sexual partners.

65
00:08:46,310 --> 00:08:55,340
For a vector borne disease, contact is often defined as the mosquito biting rate for a waterborne disease.

66
00:08:55,340 --> 00:09:07,860
Infection is defined as the ingestion rate. For directly transmitted disease, contact is defined as any kind of close contact.

67
00:09:07,860 --> 00:09:14,600
And finally, for a zoonotic disease, contact can be defined as that, as contact with animals.

68
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:21,210
The zoonoses can also be vector or waterborne and therefore vectors and survivor and survival

69
00:09:21,210 --> 00:09:30,130
in and environment or contact with the environment may also be relevant to the contact rate.

70
00:09:30,130 --> 00:09:38,500
Here we go. Here is the formulation of our not for the S.A.S. as they are and FCI our models.

71
00:09:38,500 --> 00:09:53,500
Note that when the state variables are in units a fraction an equals one, we can reformulate our not as an over the steady state value of S.

72
00:09:53,500 --> 00:09:58,720
We get these steady state value for from our no client analysis.

73
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:07,780
Again, hand equals one. If our state variables take on units of fractions.

74
00:10:07,780 --> 00:10:18,550
As infinity is the steady state value for us. The effective reproductive number has a slightly different definition.

75
00:10:18,550 --> 00:10:24,240
It is that it is the actual number of secondary cases that occur per case.

76
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:33,210
The basic reproductive number that we've been talking about is the maximum number of cases generated, given a completely susceptible population.

77
00:10:33,210 --> 00:10:45,150
So four. So for the effective or not, we use X in the numerator instead of an.

78
00:10:45,150 --> 00:10:51,330
So when asked who's that steady state equal that has infinity,

79
00:10:51,330 --> 00:11:01,860
the effective reproductive number equals one Lexis flaw in a more complicated expression for Ana.

80
00:11:01,860 --> 00:11:11,900
This is the transmission model for TV. We will look at this example and apply our Ristic for coming up with a formulation for our NOT.

81
00:11:11,900 --> 00:11:14,690
First, let's go over the model structure.

82
00:11:14,690 --> 00:11:26,120
People enter into the risk group at a rate pi the fraction row will do a fraction row will develop active TB from an infection.

83
00:11:26,120 --> 00:11:35,090
Of those a fraction F will be infectious represented by t'ai and a fraction one minus F will be noninfectious

84
00:11:35,090 --> 00:11:46,240
represented by T sub and I once infectious people will die of TB at a rate nuti and will be cured at a rate C.

85
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:53,180
That is, this is the fast pathway to infectious TB T'ai.

86
00:11:53,180 --> 00:12:00,110
And as noted by the orange area, others that are exposed to TB are latently infected.

87
00:12:00,110 --> 00:12:04,000
A fraction one minus RO can enter into the latent state.

88
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:17,540
E. Individuals leave the latent state at a rate new and have active TV and a fraction queue of those with active TB will be infectious.

89
00:12:17,540 --> 00:12:25,150
This slow pathway to infection is marked by the Red Arrow.

90
00:12:25,150 --> 00:12:33,740
Hard not for this model is as some of the are not from the fast way pathway and they are not from the slow pathway.

91
00:12:33,740 --> 00:12:42,260
Each term has the same data. Times pi over Ammu factor, representing the maximum potential for creating secondary cases.

92
00:12:42,260 --> 00:12:49,490
Each term has the same one over new plus Mutahi plus C term representing the average duration.

93
00:12:49,490 --> 00:12:55,710
Someone is infectious. The slow are not term has an added attenuation factor.

94
00:12:55,710 --> 00:13:00,430
New over new plus new.

95
00:13:00,430 --> 00:13:11,200
The last piece of his expression to note is that a fraction of the population halftimes row contributes to the fast or not term and a fraction,

96
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:17,750
one minus four times Q contributes to slow are not term.

97
00:13:17,750 --> 00:13:24,610
From this description, you should be able to write down the Arnott expression.

98
00:13:24,610 --> 00:13:33,820
How can we use our not we can use our not to explore approaches to eliminate a disease, given the expression for our not,

99
00:13:33,820 --> 00:13:40,420
we can decrease our not by decreasing the susceptible population size through vaccination,

100
00:13:40,420 --> 00:13:46,320
we can decrease the transmission rate parameter through hygiene.

101
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:55,670
And or we can decrease the disease duration parameter through screening.

102
00:13:55,670 --> 00:14:00,310
So that vaccinations have different mechanisms and work under various or work under various

103
00:14:00,310 --> 00:14:11,410
mechanisms and are not can help this where depending on whether a vaccine makes someone immune.

104
00:14:11,410 --> 00:14:17,890
Decreases their susceptibility or their time or decrease the time they are infectious.

105
00:14:17,890 --> 00:14:27,790
We would change different parameters. So this is an overview of our not in further class period.

106
00:14:27,790 --> 00:14:37,978
We'll be looking at different examples in how are not being is used in the literature.
