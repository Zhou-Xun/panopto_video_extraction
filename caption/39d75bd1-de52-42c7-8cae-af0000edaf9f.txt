1
00:00:01,470 --> 00:00:22,210
Honestly, I think I am in between. But like what I'm saying is, like you, I'm so scared of giving spoilers.

2
00:00:22,690 --> 00:00:42,970
Yeah, yeah, I know what's going to happen to me.

3
00:00:43,230 --> 00:00:55,490
My sister doesn't want me to describe exactly.

4
00:00:55,680 --> 00:01:04,920
It's like more detailed, like, older again, I'm sure.

5
00:01:11,770 --> 00:01:22,680
Now it's like. I think it's like if I just read it, it'll go into my brain literally.

6
00:01:22,980 --> 00:01:30,960
Like just driving together to see the movie.

7
00:01:35,610 --> 00:01:40,020
I think that's right.

8
00:01:41,340 --> 00:02:01,350
Yeah. You know, and I wasn't doing that, you know, it was going to be like, I mean, this is actually what it was like.

9
00:02:02,090 --> 00:02:23,880
You know, somebody is going to feel like we're all like literally just like some three letter actress.

10
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:30,360
So it's like half the body is trying to figure out what all of them are like.

11
00:02:30,950 --> 00:02:38,700
And I'm like 1.5. So they have the different categories.

12
00:02:39,270 --> 00:02:47,370
Last season I did it really differently.

13
00:02:48,390 --> 00:02:57,570
I don't mind because it's just, you know, I,

14
00:02:58,350 --> 00:03:15,010
I know I have already said I don't know what I to right about that she didn't tell me tell me so you know,

15
00:03:18,180 --> 00:03:39,520
so I don't get upset because I really think I just didn't fight back.

16
00:03:44,370 --> 00:03:49,640
All you got to say, I'd be like and then I'm like, no, if we start to finish, actually, because, you know,

17
00:03:49,780 --> 00:04:00,170
I find that I'll be like, oh, this isn't like they actually have a meeting at the top of their time as a human being.

18
00:04:00,180 --> 00:04:04,140
So this is really. What is it?

19
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:13,490
Oh, I see. Oh, I'm sorry. We're 530 in the morning.

20
00:04:14,250 --> 00:04:25,500
Embarrassing. Just learning about anybody and everybody.

21
00:04:27,450 --> 00:04:33,390
Special accommodations took all over for you.

22
00:04:34,980 --> 00:04:41,130
Okay, I'm going to have two notes.

23
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:47,010
There's a line on every page. That doesn't mean anything.

24
00:04:48,270 --> 00:04:52,530
If the copier did that, and I'm not sure why it does that.

25
00:04:53,790 --> 00:04:59,610
Like the last page. Is the essay working or.

26
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:05,120
She may use bullet points and have a very succinct answer.

27
00:05:09,410 --> 00:06:09,860
Any questions before you get started? And that's just because as one of the top, please put your student I.D. number.

28
00:06:10,040 --> 00:06:13,700
Okay. Have a greater grade in the exam.

29
00:06:13,760 --> 00:06:18,050
I want to be unbiased in grading. You may know some of you, but not all of you.

30
00:06:31,750 --> 00:06:38,270
Because it's one hour.

31
00:06:39,530 --> 00:06:43,370
You have until a little after 10:00.

32
00:06:43,580 --> 00:06:47,540
I got here a little late getting other people settled. So get a little few more minutes.

33
00:06:47,990 --> 00:06:51,140
Thank you. I will.

34
00:06:51,530 --> 00:06:54,890
I will let you know. All right. I'll be right back.

35
00:06:55,970 --> 00:06:59,700
We have one additional cost and an extra one. Okay.

36
00:07:52,710 --> 00:08:02,360
Sure. It's.

37
00:16:53,570 --> 00:21:48,140
It's. She?

38
00:23:47,250 --> 00:26:22,720
Just. James.

39
00:30:23,690 --> 00:33:19,280
It's 9:00 right now. It's just.

40
00:34:48,040 --> 00:34:56,760
It's just. She?

41
00:35:14,100 --> 00:36:23,670
Just. I.

42
00:39:38,150 --> 00:44:25,490
She? It's just.

43
00:45:55,700 --> 00:46:19,600
The. It's just.

44
00:46:28,150 --> 00:48:08,160
She? She?

45
00:48:54,350 --> 00:50:20,210
It's. It's just great.

46
00:50:36,020 --> 00:51:06,730
It's. I'm just.

47
00:51:27,740 --> 00:51:54,090
That's. It's.

48
00:53:17,670 --> 00:56:27,630
She? I will be back in a few minutes.

49
00:56:55,190 --> 00:57:00,180
It's just.

50
00:59:25,300 --> 01:00:03,450
You. You.

51
01:01:27,520 --> 01:03:26,850
It's. It's.

52
01:04:48,870 --> 01:05:39,540
You. It's a little after 930, I think.

53
01:06:01,170 --> 01:06:29,280
Yeah. Yeah, I think so.

54
01:06:41,640 --> 01:07:13,200
That's correct. Just.

55
01:07:33,030 --> 01:07:55,980
Thanks. I just.

56
01:08:13,730 --> 01:08:21,980
Thank you for.

57
01:08:49,710 --> 01:09:31,310
Am. Okay.

58
01:09:34,410 --> 01:09:41,970
She? It's.

59
01:10:26,320 --> 01:10:36,430
The. It just.

60
01:11:11,800 --> 01:11:22,830
It's one of those things you just can't see, like you see.

61
01:11:36,980 --> 01:11:43,390
So here we go.

62
01:12:35,030 --> 01:12:39,850
One I hundred.

63
01:12:53,110 --> 01:13:08,510
It's a controversial. Clinton trucks.

64
01:13:12,980 --> 01:13:34,050
Controversial. Well.

65
01:13:48,650 --> 01:13:54,880
I remember.

66
01:15:27,480 --> 01:15:58,740
She? Joining.

67
01:16:23,910 --> 01:16:48,770
So you've got your 15 minutes left. I guess.

68
01:17:02,580 --> 01:17:13,350
But I mean, you know, if you.

69
01:17:45,330 --> 01:18:14,640
Like. Think.

70
01:18:24,540 --> 01:18:30,780
True. He's.

71
01:18:40,610 --> 01:18:51,050
Think of the squishy terms and a healthy.

72
01:19:14,330 --> 01:19:22,350
It's very serious.

73
01:19:47,740 --> 01:19:50,730
I mean, it's rationalizations.
