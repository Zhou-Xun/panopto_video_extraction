1
00:00:01,920 --> 00:00:06,020
Yes, I know. I think.

2
00:00:11,923 --> 00:00:15,253
Morning, everybody. I like.

3
00:00:16,593 --> 00:00:22,883
I don't know. It was great.

4
00:00:23,133 --> 00:00:26,763
How are you doing? Good. All right.

5
00:00:26,853 --> 00:00:31,923
Feeling good so far this semester in terms of M.A., I mean,

6
00:00:32,103 --> 00:00:38,043
we'll be very specific with everybody feeling okay with what we've covered for the most part.

7
00:00:39,723 --> 00:00:43,353
Okay. Today's kind of lecture.

8
00:00:43,353 --> 00:00:47,462
Heavy. There's a whole there's not, like, a case or a whole lot of discussion.

9
00:00:47,463 --> 00:00:55,383
But this will wrap up kind of our first, you know, chunk of the semester,

10
00:00:55,383 --> 00:01:01,803
which I think is always great to get this kind of some of this course up behind us and we can move forward from there.

11
00:01:03,033 --> 00:01:06,063
Tuesday, remember, take your exam. Don't come to class.

12
00:01:06,243 --> 00:01:10,243
It will be available very early. Can access it any time during the day.

13
00:01:10,263 --> 00:01:18,552
Just access it before midnight. I don't know if some of you are late night workers, but after that it will be closed.

14
00:01:18,553 --> 00:01:21,933
So you do have to open it before the end of the day.

15
00:01:23,883 --> 00:01:30,393
Okay. So today we're going to wrap up our discussion on biochemical assessment.

16
00:01:30,393 --> 00:01:37,413
As part of our nutrition assessment, we've talked about estimating energy needs, protein needs, food needs.

17
00:01:37,413 --> 00:01:46,353
We've talked about kind of the anthropometric and a little bit on the physical findings as part of our nutrition assessment.

18
00:01:46,413 --> 00:01:52,382
Now, we're looking at, okay, now they have some labs, how can we interpret those?

19
00:01:52,383 --> 00:01:59,253
And is part of our assessment. So all of this is part of our assessment of our patient when we go in and see them.

20
00:02:00,603 --> 00:02:04,983
So we kind of left off talking about fluid balance and going along with that.

21
00:02:05,313 --> 00:02:10,993
I want to talk briefly about electrolytes. You know what?

22
00:02:11,433 --> 00:02:21,273
We won't get into too much in terms of electrolyte imbalances, but maybe a little bit with some of the different conditions.

23
00:02:21,273 --> 00:02:26,012
But more so next semester, we're talking nutrition support.

24
00:02:26,013 --> 00:02:29,463
I know I say that a lot, but that that kind of will bring some of this together.

25
00:02:31,413 --> 00:02:33,663
Okay. So let's talk about serum sodium.

26
00:02:33,663 --> 00:02:45,873
This will be a part of like what's called a basic metabolic panel that hopefully watch that just very short introductory lecture on Q with laboratory.

27
00:02:46,203 --> 00:02:52,593
So the basic metabolic panel, almost everyone, when they get hospitalized, they'll draw a pump.

28
00:02:53,523 --> 00:02:56,673
And usually the first electrolyte on there is sodium.

29
00:02:58,173 --> 00:03:03,303
So you can see here a normal serum sodium is in within this range, 136 to 144.

30
00:03:04,323 --> 00:03:08,552
So hypo meaning low neutrino. So this is low serum.

31
00:03:08,553 --> 00:03:12,663
Sodium is a very common electrolyte abnormality in hospitalized patients.

32
00:03:13,263 --> 00:03:16,412
Sometimes it's, you know, maybe just a little bit low.

33
00:03:16,413 --> 00:03:25,472
And that's not super concerning. It is your serum sodium level will reflect the balance between dietary intake.

34
00:03:25,473 --> 00:03:32,493
So there is some influence on dietary intake, but more so the renal excretory function.

35
00:03:32,503 --> 00:03:41,492
So as free but free body water increases like our total body water, our serum sodium level decreases.

36
00:03:41,493 --> 00:03:48,393
So if we're overloaded with water, we're going to see the serum sodium levels go down.

37
00:03:49,203 --> 00:03:58,083
So hyponatremia in our hospitalized patients usually, but of course not always can be caused by excessive, hypertonic IV fluid.

38
00:03:58,083 --> 00:04:03,653
So if they're giving patient I.V. fluids that maybe don't have as much value in them,

39
00:04:03,873 --> 00:04:12,003
so more more water based, it also could be due to gastrointestinal losses of sodium rich fluid.

40
00:04:13,083 --> 00:04:20,402
So sometimes our patients will have gastric suctioning happening for different diseases.

41
00:04:20,403 --> 00:04:24,212
Maybe they have something called gastroparesis, which we'll discuss later this semester,

42
00:04:24,213 --> 00:04:30,273
where there's not a lot of movement of food and fluids out of the stomach.

43
00:04:30,273 --> 00:04:33,512
So patients feel really sick, they're nonexistent going up.

44
00:04:33,513 --> 00:04:39,363
So sometimes they'll be on what we call gastric suctioning, and that's really eliminating a lot of these sodium rich fluids.

45
00:04:40,173 --> 00:04:44,343
Diarrhea gets. You lose electrolytes through stool.

46
00:04:44,703 --> 00:04:47,943
If they have an ileostomy, they have very high output.

47
00:04:48,413 --> 00:04:54,242
Again, another reason why they may be losing a lot of these fluids and then it's just

48
00:04:54,243 --> 00:04:58,953
maybe being replaced with just water and that they can become like body treatment.

49
00:05:01,563 --> 00:05:10,323
There are some situations where serum glucose concentrations can also affect the serum sodium.

50
00:05:10,323 --> 00:05:15,693
So this is really usually seen with high, very high blood glucose levels.

51
00:05:15,703 --> 00:05:21,573
So the increase in the plasma osmolarity, which we haven't really gotten into those types of terms,

52
00:05:21,573 --> 00:05:26,463
that's just referring to the amount of sound in the plasma.

53
00:05:28,053 --> 00:05:36,843
So there's an increase in the plasma osmolarity with hypoglycemia and that that's going to pull water out of the cells into the blood.

54
00:05:36,993 --> 00:05:40,683
So it'll be higher amounts of water than usual.

55
00:05:40,683 --> 00:05:45,303
And that can that's going to be reflected the lower serum sodium levels.

56
00:05:47,093 --> 00:05:57,223
When a patient is hyponatremia, all other lab values, for the most part, will appear less concentrated to some extent.

57
00:05:57,233 --> 00:06:01,103
So it can make interpreting other levels a little bit difficult.

58
00:06:02,573 --> 00:06:05,873
So the body compensates by increasing water loss.

59
00:06:06,473 --> 00:06:13,583
Very low sodium levels are associated with weakness and can have some severe neurological symptoms and vascular problems.

60
00:06:13,583 --> 00:06:21,293
So when there is extreme or very severe hyponatremia, there is some some significant consequences potentially.

61
00:06:23,343 --> 00:06:28,413
Hibernate Crimea. So this would be, of course, an increase in the serum sodium.

62
00:06:29,223 --> 00:06:34,382
This is commonly a result of impaired water intake or just like a relative water deficit like we talked about.

63
00:06:34,383 --> 00:06:36,123
So when somebody is dehydrated,

64
00:06:37,503 --> 00:06:44,883
they may come in and they will their serum sodium level will be high and that will correct once they're given IV fluids.

65
00:06:45,573 --> 00:06:49,363
So lots of things can contribute to electrolyte imbalances.

66
00:06:49,383 --> 00:06:53,463
We're just kind of highlighting some of the main contributors who might.

67
00:06:54,123 --> 00:06:59,093
In a hospitalized patients. Okay.

68
00:06:59,093 --> 00:07:04,573
So potassium that's also on our basic metabolic panel could see the range here.

69
00:07:04,583 --> 00:07:12,412
It is minimally affected by diet. There are some disease conditions where we do monitor serum potassium closely and

70
00:07:12,413 --> 00:07:16,913
as a way to see if a patient is maybe compliant with their low potassium diet.

71
00:07:16,913 --> 00:07:20,033
That's more so in chronic kidney disease.

72
00:07:21,053 --> 00:07:27,333
But for the most part, checking the serum potassium level isn't telling us much about dietary adequacy.

73
00:07:28,553 --> 00:07:40,513
Her potassium. Potassium. So low levels of potassium, so hypokalemia, again the increases seen in excessive GI losses.

74
00:07:40,523 --> 00:07:50,903
So if a patient comes in with, you know, experiencing multiple days of excessive diarrhea, oftentimes their potassium will be low.

75
00:07:51,233 --> 00:07:59,873
We know about the intercellular shift we seen during re feeding syndrome where the potassium kind of follows the glucose into the cell,

76
00:08:00,143 --> 00:08:05,453
leaving blood levels very low. And then there are medications that can deplete potassium.

77
00:08:07,103 --> 00:08:14,753
Often these are going to be diuretics that are going to stimulate the kidneys to release more urine.

78
00:08:14,783 --> 00:08:19,973
And with that, we see potassium losses. There are some diuretics that use their potassium.

79
00:08:20,483 --> 00:08:26,483
But many of these movement, five side diuretics don't even know the difference there.

80
00:08:26,483 --> 00:08:30,953
But those will you'll see increased potassium losses in those medications.

81
00:08:32,453 --> 00:08:39,003
Yeah. Yeah.

82
00:08:39,813 --> 00:08:48,663
And how come? Diuretics will affect serum sodium.

83
00:08:48,663 --> 00:08:54,183
So. No.

84
00:08:54,213 --> 00:08:57,603
This particular is specific to potassium.

85
00:08:58,023 --> 00:09:02,313
The point of somebody using the non diabetics is that they are fluid.

86
00:09:03,513 --> 00:09:07,173
So that their serum sodium would be reflective of that.

87
00:09:08,553 --> 00:09:13,563
So they'll be treated with antibiotics and intend to make that accessible care.

88
00:09:14,433 --> 00:09:19,213
But with those that's the intention is that this will also.

89
00:09:24,343 --> 00:09:34,843
Okay. So hyperkalemia again this will we'll talk a lot about renal diets next semester,

90
00:09:34,843 --> 00:09:41,832
but when a patient has compromised kidney function, they're not able to excrete potassium as well.

91
00:09:41,833 --> 00:09:45,223
So we see rice, you know, raise blood levels of potassium.

92
00:09:46,873 --> 00:09:48,223
So decreased kidney function,

93
00:09:48,223 --> 00:09:56,353
we can see hyperkalemia that will be more impacted by the diet because they are not their kidneys are not functioning as they should.

94
00:09:57,553 --> 00:10:03,193
And then there are certain medications, let's say they're on diuretics, going to potassium, sparing diuretics.

95
00:10:03,293 --> 00:10:06,613
We see that that causes retention of potassium.

96
00:10:07,003 --> 00:10:15,613
And then these are. Some other medications that can we can see increased potassium.

97
00:10:15,613 --> 00:10:21,643
So steroids oftentimes after like a.

98
00:10:26,043 --> 00:10:29,793
Kidney. Sorry. A kidney transplant.

99
00:10:29,823 --> 00:10:38,133
Oh, my gosh. Sorry. If somebody has a kidney transplant, we may see retention of potassium because of these medications that are on.

100
00:10:41,823 --> 00:10:48,213
Okay. So speaking of the kidney, have you all heard of a B1 and creatinine you see in those terms?

101
00:10:49,263 --> 00:10:59,403
These are part of that basic metabolic panel. And in short, these are like a good snapshot in terms of monitoring or assessing kidney function.

102
00:11:00,393 --> 00:11:03,993
Of course, there's other more specific labs we can draw to assess kidney function.

103
00:11:05,403 --> 00:11:11,073
So the B1 or the blood urea, nitrogen measures, the amount of urea, nitrogen in the blood.

104
00:11:11,073 --> 00:11:14,283
So urea is a byproduct of protein metabolism.

105
00:11:15,213 --> 00:11:21,122
So we can see an increased blend in people that have compromised kidney function.

106
00:11:21,123 --> 00:11:29,853
So if they have kidney disease, they're not able to excrete those byproducts of protein metabolism as well.

107
00:11:30,153 --> 00:11:33,753
So we'll see an increase in length also in somebody's C hydrated.

108
00:11:33,753 --> 00:11:36,962
So this one is impacted by fluid status.

109
00:11:36,963 --> 00:11:44,643
So if they come in dehydrated, usually their viewing may also be elevated and that will correct as soon as they're being hydrated.

110
00:11:47,143 --> 00:11:52,243
Sometimes we can see an increase in excessive protein catabolism.

111
00:11:53,473 --> 00:12:00,883
But this I would not use the viewpoint as a measure of protein adequacy.

112
00:12:03,043 --> 00:12:04,823
There are certain situations where we.

113
00:12:06,983 --> 00:12:15,923
Sometimes it's if you look at like clinical trials or studies looking at weight lifting, people that participate in weightlifting,

114
00:12:15,923 --> 00:12:21,773
sometimes they have more elevated people and that could be due to the very high protein.

115
00:12:23,343 --> 00:12:28,153
Sumption, but also said that despite their. But again.

116
00:12:30,163 --> 00:12:36,193
Very few cases, we're actually going to use the blood as like a measure of protein adequacy in the diet.

117
00:12:38,143 --> 00:12:43,693
We could see a decrease in in liver failure with there is a negative nitrogen balance.

118
00:12:43,693 --> 00:12:50,982
Again, be careful with this. You know, just because somebody has a decreased B1 does not necessarily mean they're not getting enough protein.

119
00:12:50,983 --> 00:12:57,343
These are impacted by many body bodily systems in pregnancy.

120
00:12:57,343 --> 00:13:02,743
We can't see decreased. B when just I think that's due to just.

121
00:13:03,983 --> 00:13:07,023
Really optimal work on the part the.

122
00:13:08,643 --> 00:13:12,363
Middle. So that can be a common finding.

123
00:13:12,363 --> 00:13:15,753
That's not usually anything remarkable.

124
00:13:15,933 --> 00:13:20,193
It's just something that we do see. Okay.

125
00:13:20,283 --> 00:13:24,843
Creatinine is also kind of like a measure of kidney function.

126
00:13:24,993 --> 00:13:33,693
It is a waste product or creatine creatinine is a waste product produced by the muscles from the breakdown of creatine.

127
00:13:33,723 --> 00:13:39,632
So almost all creatine is filtered from the blood by the kidneys and released into the urine.

128
00:13:39,633 --> 00:13:43,292
So blood levels will be a good indicator of how well the kidneys are working.

129
00:13:43,293 --> 00:13:49,203
So that's one of the things we'll monitor in our patients that do have compromised function.

130
00:13:51,693 --> 00:13:58,113
So it will be increased if somebody is in renal failure or has some type of trauma injury.

131
00:14:00,493 --> 00:14:09,343
It can be decreased in folks that are malnourished. Again, these would not be tools I would use as part of our nutrition assessment necessarily.

132
00:14:10,123 --> 00:14:17,083
But low level blood levels of creatinine are not common, and they're also usually not a cause for concern.

133
00:14:18,493 --> 00:14:22,093
They can be seen in conditions that will result in decreased muscle mass,

134
00:14:22,093 --> 00:14:27,703
but we could see that in aging lots, the variety of different diseases and conditions.

135
00:14:28,543 --> 00:14:37,333
But we would use other tools currently in our toolkit to assess as see a protein intake.

136
00:14:37,643 --> 00:14:44,383
Personal status outside of the. Okay.

137
00:14:44,863 --> 00:14:51,103
Let's talk a little bit about calcium. Our body is very good at tightly regulating our calcium.

138
00:14:52,993 --> 00:15:04,253
Serum levels are related to many, many factors. I would I would say that the serum calcium is not reflective usually of dietary intake.

139
00:15:04,273 --> 00:15:07,993
Our body tightly regulates are calcium levels.

140
00:15:08,833 --> 00:15:14,683
So like a patient asked that, can you can you just check my calcium to see if I'm getting enough?

141
00:15:15,023 --> 00:15:19,723
No, it's definitely not. This lab especially is not that simple.

142
00:15:23,593 --> 00:15:28,242
Calcium and phosphorus have a relationship, calcium and parathyroid have a relationship.

143
00:15:28,243 --> 00:15:33,403
So it is highly complex in inner woven with other functions in the body.

144
00:15:34,483 --> 00:15:44,143
One thing I want to note, so when we see low blood calcium, 40 to 40 5 to 50% of our serum calcium is bound to serum albumin.

145
00:15:45,163 --> 00:15:48,253
And then we have a we're going to do like a practice calculation.

146
00:15:48,463 --> 00:15:56,593
So a one gram decrease in serum albumin results in about 1.8 milligrams increase in zero calcium.

147
00:15:58,463 --> 00:16:08,633
So whenever we see somebody with low blood calcium, we also want to see what their fluid status is and if their albumin is low serum albumin,

148
00:16:08,633 --> 00:16:12,683
which we'll discuss today, highly influenced by fluid status.

149
00:16:12,683 --> 00:16:19,823
So if somebody has fluid overloaded, a lot of times their albumin is also low, which will make their health care low.

150
00:16:20,903 --> 00:16:28,953
So we need to do a little bit of easy math to measure what we call corrective health care, and we'll do an example of that.

151
00:16:30,953 --> 00:16:37,013
There's also a blood test called an ionized calcium or an eye count sometimes that's referred to.

152
00:16:38,003 --> 00:16:42,533
This would be a separate test, so you'd have to ask for this and have it ordered.

153
00:16:43,133 --> 00:16:51,983
This can be a better measure of calcium status in our patients when albumin is low and it's kind of a better measure of free calcium,

154
00:16:53,003 --> 00:16:56,903
and that's not going to be affected by the albumin levels.

155
00:16:59,423 --> 00:17:02,933
Okay. So hypercalcemia again.

156
00:17:02,933 --> 00:17:08,453
Rarely the cause is often not because somebody is consuming too much calcium in the diet.

157
00:17:08,843 --> 00:17:13,103
Usually if somebody has excessive hypercalcemia, there's something else going on.

158
00:17:13,613 --> 00:17:25,543
Um. We see hypercalcemia different. They have hyper parathyroid that can cause an increase in the blood calcium levels.

159
00:17:27,343 --> 00:17:35,802
And then if somebody is immobile, so maybe they're bedridden, that can trigger an increase in osteo classic bone resorption.

160
00:17:35,803 --> 00:17:38,863
So we see increased levels of calcium in.

161
00:17:39,443 --> 00:17:46,013
So I would say the biggest takeaway here is calcium levels tightly regulated by our body.

162
00:17:46,613 --> 00:17:54,293
If we have a low blood calcium, we always want to check if the albumin is also low so that we can do a corrected calcium.

163
00:17:54,743 --> 00:17:59,903
And then hypercalcemia really is very rarely do the two dietary.

164
00:18:03,493 --> 00:18:09,253
Okay. So let's do this together. So let's say our patients, your calcium level is 8.1.

165
00:18:09,253 --> 00:18:12,493
We see the range for normal is 8.6 to 10.

166
00:18:13,093 --> 00:18:21,822
And we also notice their fear about the administration, which is also how we correct that is this is the formula.

167
00:18:21,823 --> 00:18:28,423
So we're going to subtract the first serum albumin from four just kind of like a midpoint of a normal range.

168
00:18:30,163 --> 00:18:34,153
So we take their current albumin, subtract it from four,

169
00:18:34,423 --> 00:18:42,312
we're going to multiply it by that 0.8 because that's about the amount of decrease we see in calcium.

170
00:18:42,313 --> 00:18:51,253
And for every one pull out, the normal albumin will add added to their serum calcium.

171
00:18:52,023 --> 00:18:59,893
So once we do this correct and calcium carbonate, we see that their calcium is 8.9, which is normal.

172
00:19:03,603 --> 00:19:07,293
So just as a hint, if you get a case study.

173
00:19:08,283 --> 00:19:15,663
Palestinians below. Check your albumin and then you want to carry this out, this calculation out before you offer an interpretation.

174
00:19:15,843 --> 00:19:19,353
Yeah. For just for is yes.

175
00:19:19,353 --> 00:19:24,273
It's always for no matter what their albumin to 2.5 use the for.

176
00:19:24,273 --> 00:19:29,483
I know I said it's for everyone decreased but that number is constant in the formula is now.

177
00:19:31,853 --> 00:19:36,563
Equals total cost. Yes. Yep. So here is the.

178
00:19:39,863 --> 00:19:48,203
Measured serum calcium. So for minus or serum albumin multiply by 0.8 and then add it to their measured serum calcium.

179
00:19:51,703 --> 00:19:54,863
Know, I should probably get lost in the distance.

180
00:19:56,453 --> 00:20:03,423
Any other questions on that? What kind of situation may make way?

181
00:20:03,543 --> 00:20:07,173
May we see a low serum albumin in our patients?

182
00:20:13,383 --> 00:20:16,413
Inflammation. Yes, it's a negative acute phase.

183
00:20:16,413 --> 00:20:22,983
Responding to a lot of our patients in the hospital have some degree of inflammation probably happening.

184
00:20:23,643 --> 00:20:27,333
Yes. So serum albumin, low serum. I'll be very busy.

185
00:20:29,253 --> 00:20:34,973
So just keep that in mind. Or if you get a referral like their serum, calcium is really low.

186
00:20:34,983 --> 00:20:40,142
We need to start them on supplements because you will get that from your medical team.

187
00:20:40,143 --> 00:20:44,833
Then you can kind of offer some. Some feedback on it.

188
00:20:44,833 --> 00:20:52,543
Maybe that is the case, but we'd want to explore further by investigating diet all of the things, not just the serum calcium map.

189
00:20:57,003 --> 00:21:00,513
Okay. Phosphorus we've talked about phosphorus would be feeding syndrome.

190
00:21:01,173 --> 00:21:10,353
But as far as a lab value system, phosphorus is a poor reflection of the body's stores in the blood because the majority is found in

191
00:21:10,353 --> 00:21:16,322
organic compounds in the body being primarily the bones they serve as a reservoir for phosphorus.

192
00:21:16,323 --> 00:21:21,453
So the amount of phosphate in the blood also affects the amount of calcium in the blood.

193
00:21:22,623 --> 00:21:24,723
And those kind of have an inverse relationship.

194
00:21:24,723 --> 00:21:32,013
So calcium and phosphate in the body react in opposite ways as blood calcium level rise, phosphate levels tend to fall.

195
00:21:32,643 --> 00:21:40,563
And then we have the our parathyroid hormone or p t h that will regulate the levels of calcium and phosphorus in the blood.

196
00:21:41,783 --> 00:21:45,923
Vitamin D also plays a role in our our phosphorus levels.

197
00:21:45,923 --> 00:21:56,993
So serum phosphorus levels are really determined by calcium metabolism, parathyroid hormone renal excretion as well as intestinal absorption.

198
00:21:58,433 --> 00:22:03,193
So our serum levels are not necessarily a good reflection of our phosphorus stores.

199
00:22:05,623 --> 00:22:18,253
Well, first of all, if we have impaired intestinal absorption, um, vitamin D deficiency can impact our ability to absorb adequate phosphorus.

200
00:22:19,573 --> 00:22:24,372
Certain medications are phosphate binding, which sometimes we use purposefully.

201
00:22:24,373 --> 00:22:30,703
So for our patients with kidney disease that have elevated phosphate, we have them take phosphorus binders with every meal.

202
00:22:31,993 --> 00:22:35,622
But there are some that people may be taking unknowingly.

203
00:22:35,623 --> 00:22:43,353
Like, for instance, Tums is a phosphate binder. So if somebody is eating a lot of Tums for indigestion and maybe they have a low serum pass,

204
00:22:43,543 --> 00:22:49,452
that could be life or it could be contributing to other medications.

205
00:22:49,453 --> 00:22:55,393
What can also impact phosphorus? We also see low phosphorus in chronic alcoholism.

206
00:22:55,393 --> 00:23:00,823
We've talked about intracellular shifts in repeating syndrome and then there could be increased

207
00:23:00,823 --> 00:23:09,823
losses from if somebody has hypoparathyroidism recovering from a DKA that's diabetic ketoacidosis.

208
00:23:10,513 --> 00:23:21,293
So some of the trends, cellular shifts we see there. And low blood magnesium can also affect our serum phosphorus.

209
00:23:24,553 --> 00:23:28,093
The big takeaway here is that it's hugely multifactorial.

210
00:23:28,123 --> 00:23:38,863
You don't have to know all these different. What about an elevated serum phosphorus so hyper fast the Tamia usually that's going to be due to

211
00:23:38,863 --> 00:23:43,513
decreased renal excretion so this will be in our patients with acute or chronic renal failure.

212
00:23:44,893 --> 00:23:54,282
Often they will have elevated serum phosphorus. Sometimes we can monitor fear and phosphorus as a sign of excessive dietary intake.

213
00:23:54,283 --> 00:24:02,473
So if our patients are on dialysis where the the dialysis is doing the work of the kidney and removing that excess phosphorus,

214
00:24:02,473 --> 00:24:04,122
and then between dialysis visits,

215
00:24:04,123 --> 00:24:13,213
if their phosphorus is jumping up way, way high, they get a sign that they're maybe a little bit noncompliant with their low phosphorus type.

216
00:24:13,573 --> 00:24:16,962
But it also we might investigate other reasons as well.

217
00:24:16,963 --> 00:24:21,733
But that can be helpful. Like if they're continually running really high between dialysis visits,

218
00:24:22,333 --> 00:24:26,713
they probably are following that little phosphorus diet as well as we would hope.

219
00:24:29,183 --> 00:24:34,763
Certain conditions have increased cellular release. So release of phosphorus from the cell into the blood.

220
00:24:37,133 --> 00:24:39,863
Those are more specific conditions we won't go into.

221
00:24:39,893 --> 00:24:49,703
Just usually conditions that have like a more rapid cellular turnover and in some cases an increasing side from this phosphorus load.

222
00:24:52,403 --> 00:24:57,563
Excessive dietary intake, primarily patients that will have poor renal function.

223
00:24:58,013 --> 00:25:08,293
I seen that. Phosphorus containing laxatives or enemas or excessive vitamin D can also contribute to to elevated phosphorus.

224
00:25:12,013 --> 00:25:18,243
All right. So magnesium, again, this fast source of magnesium are not part of that basic metabolic panel.

225
00:25:18,253 --> 00:25:27,793
These would be separate labs. But often we may have to add these on if we wanted to get a full picture of what's going on with their electrolytes.

226
00:25:30,053 --> 00:25:33,143
So magnesium is intimately linked with calcium.

227
00:25:33,893 --> 00:25:38,963
It's awful. It's also difficult to maintain potassium levels when magnesium is low.

228
00:25:40,313 --> 00:25:44,782
Magnesium helps to transport calcium and potassium ions in and out of the cells.

229
00:25:44,783 --> 00:25:53,333
So you could see if magnesium was deficient or low, it would also potentially impact our transport of calcium and potassium.

230
00:25:53,993 --> 00:25:59,063
So magnesium homeostasis is maintained by the intestines bone in the kidneys.

231
00:25:59,753 --> 00:26:01,702
If we see elevated magnesium.

232
00:26:01,703 --> 00:26:10,493
So hyper magnesium, India, sometimes that's due to decreased kidney function and that can cause just accumulation or poor clearance of magnesium.

233
00:26:11,903 --> 00:26:17,962
I'd say more often we would seem hypo magnesium. Yeah, we do lose electrolytes in our schools.

234
00:26:17,963 --> 00:26:24,713
I've talked about that. So if somebody has extensive GI losses, whether it's through diarrhea, asthma,

235
00:26:24,713 --> 00:26:30,683
output, vomiting, often that will be reflected in their electrolyte panel.

236
00:26:32,033 --> 00:26:35,183
And again, certain medications can can waste or deplete.

237
00:26:38,103 --> 00:26:41,943
Talked about central to correct low magnesium levels.

238
00:26:42,303 --> 00:26:45,903
If we're having difficulty getting the potassium correct corrected.

239
00:26:52,403 --> 00:27:02,143
Okay. Let's talk about these proteins. We touched on these quite a bit so far this semester, but let's just drive this home.

240
00:27:02,153 --> 00:27:05,463
So. Did you read the article?

241
00:27:05,523 --> 00:27:09,213
It's an older article, but it's still, I think, really helpful.

242
00:27:10,873 --> 00:27:17,373
University of Virginia has this website where they call it the Articles in Practical Gastroenterology.

243
00:27:18,093 --> 00:27:25,142
So that's where this came from. It's a really good website with wonderful resources, often written by dietitians,

244
00:27:25,143 --> 00:27:30,103
but they do different topics in nutrition and really check it out every month.

245
00:27:30,123 --> 00:27:36,183
Usually they have a topic that they highlight and just do like a four or five page article on it.

246
00:27:36,333 --> 00:27:39,513
So it's really fantastic. I use that resource a lot.

247
00:27:40,503 --> 00:27:43,323
So this is an older paper, but I think it's so helpful.

248
00:27:43,353 --> 00:27:49,773
So these are proteins we're going to talk about albumin and problem in today, but there's also other ones.

249
00:27:50,253 --> 00:27:58,383
Talk a little bit about transparent retinol binding proteins, really just another carrier protein that helps with vitamin A metabolism.

250
00:27:59,043 --> 00:28:06,573
So these serum proteins are synthesized in the liver and integrate protein synthesis and degradation over longer periods of time.

251
00:28:07,563 --> 00:28:10,803
Traditionally, they were used as part of the nutritional assessment.

252
00:28:11,583 --> 00:28:22,353
Even when I very first started working, pre albumin was part of our malnutrition diagnostic criteria, so low albumin could be one of our two criteria.

253
00:28:22,503 --> 00:28:26,972
That's not the case anymore. But traditionally, yes.

254
00:28:26,973 --> 00:28:35,333
You take of. Why we no longer do that is because we know that these levels are not indicative of a patient's

255
00:28:35,333 --> 00:28:41,093
protein status and thus are not appropriate to use as an indicator of nutritional status.

256
00:28:43,103 --> 00:28:49,433
So we'll talk a little bit about both of these and then we'll look at that lab handbook again to see what it says under test usage.

257
00:28:52,463 --> 00:28:55,733
All right. Let's talk about opium in this again.

258
00:28:56,123 --> 00:28:59,303
Not helpful nutritionally, but a lot of times it is helpful clinically.

259
00:28:59,303 --> 00:29:05,452
So you'll see this lab done often in patients, some more often in certain conditions.

260
00:29:05,453 --> 00:29:12,473
But albumin, it's a serum protein with a relatively large.

261
00:29:14,893 --> 00:29:19,333
Body pool size and about 5%, which is synthesized in the liver daily.

262
00:29:19,963 --> 00:29:25,032
The majority of our bodies albumin is distributed between the vascular and interstitial space,

263
00:29:25,033 --> 00:29:34,663
so it's in that extracellular fluid, but more than 50% is located extra vascular, so outside of the blood vessel.

264
00:29:34,663 --> 00:29:42,883
So getting a blood level of albumin isn't reflective of of our total stores.

265
00:29:45,003 --> 00:29:50,673
So very little of the body's albumin pool is comprised of newly synthesized albumin,

266
00:29:51,843 --> 00:29:56,283
so protein intake has very little effect on total albumin on a daily basis.

267
00:29:56,873 --> 00:30:00,513
Okay. So it's not like reflective of of our protein intake.

268
00:30:01,873 --> 00:30:07,603
And many factors can affect your albumin hydration status being a major factor.

269
00:30:10,883 --> 00:30:14,813
So net albumin is one of our negative acute phase reactants.

270
00:30:16,403 --> 00:30:20,063
So where do we see an increase in albumin?

271
00:30:20,813 --> 00:30:24,833
If somebody is dehydrated, we'll see that that albumin is healthy, elevated.

272
00:30:26,393 --> 00:30:32,452
Also, you can see in more asthma, which is a condition of malnutrition.

273
00:30:32,453 --> 00:30:37,523
Correct. So you see albumin is elevated in those patients.

274
00:30:37,523 --> 00:30:46,493
So that should tell us right there. Okay. Well, we know this is a malnutrition condition and we see an increase in albumin in those patients.

275
00:30:47,123 --> 00:30:51,413
If somebody just got a blood transfusion, they can have increased albumin.

276
00:30:51,893 --> 00:30:57,083
Or if they're getting I.V. albumin, they'll have an increase in albumin, but decrease.

277
00:30:57,083 --> 00:30:59,303
So it is a negative acute phase protein.

278
00:30:59,633 --> 00:31:07,583
It will be decreased when there is inflammation, infection or metabolic stress because of that acute phase response that we see.

279
00:31:08,603 --> 00:31:13,413
If somebody is fluid overloaded, we will see low albumin.

280
00:31:13,433 --> 00:31:22,283
So if you have your patient that comes in that has a lot of edema, you'll see that their albumin is often low and their serum sodium is often low.

281
00:31:25,343 --> 00:31:31,493
So redistribution of albumin between the extra vascular and intravascular space does occur frequently,

282
00:31:31,823 --> 00:31:34,973
and this will be affected by infusion of large amounts of fluid.

283
00:31:37,093 --> 00:31:41,803
Yes. Might not be important for life right now, but I know that.

284
00:31:44,983 --> 00:31:49,823
I know that. I like.

285
00:31:52,303 --> 00:32:01,643
Right now. Why? Not enough.

286
00:32:02,813 --> 00:32:10,073
Yeah. So if you think about like if we just like kind of picture what that looks like it is.

287
00:32:13,143 --> 00:32:19,893
Kind of like wasting happening. And that is probably due to the dehydration factor.

288
00:32:19,893 --> 00:32:27,123
Why we don't see that because there's just a lot of depletion of total body water, also protein, fat, all that,

289
00:32:27,543 --> 00:32:37,893
whereas kwashiorkor, kind of the key feature that we think about is that distended abdomen where there is fluid retention.

290
00:32:38,523 --> 00:32:45,333
So that is probably related to the fluid status of the patient, more so than the nutritional status.

291
00:32:46,433 --> 00:32:49,523
Because fluid says highly impacts albumin.

292
00:32:50,693 --> 00:32:54,983
So when we have a total body water depletion like in something like marathon.

293
00:32:56,593 --> 00:33:06,132
Potentially an increase on albumin, whereas in wash your or we have that retention of fluid and more albumin potentially in that extra

294
00:33:06,133 --> 00:33:11,203
vascular interstitial space that's not captured in the blood because of that distended abdomen.

295
00:33:12,543 --> 00:33:15,603
That would be probably why we see that.

296
00:33:17,843 --> 00:33:24,263
And you can if you see here are these other states that can lead to fluid overload.

297
00:33:24,263 --> 00:33:29,933
So a is is kind of similar to what we see in something like kwashiorkor, although it's different.

298
00:33:31,223 --> 00:33:39,353
This is what we see in patients with liver failure, heart failure or congestive heart failure, we see fluid overload.

299
00:33:39,353 --> 00:33:45,473
So a lot of these states that cause fluid retention, well, we'll see a decrease in albumin.

300
00:33:49,163 --> 00:33:53,423
And then different medications, of course, can impact it as well.

301
00:33:53,573 --> 00:34:02,333
But kind of the big takeaway that I would want you to take from this is that it is highly impacted by food status,

302
00:34:02,753 --> 00:34:11,563
more so than nutritional status, definitely. All right, so what about albumin?

303
00:34:12,783 --> 00:34:16,173
Maybe this one's a little bit better in terms of nutritional status.

304
00:34:16,213 --> 00:34:23,673
At least that's what we thought. So, like albumin, it is a visceral protein, it is a negative acute phase reactant.

305
00:34:24,063 --> 00:34:30,603
So initially thought to be a better marker of nutritional status compared to albumin because it does have a shorter half life.

306
00:34:31,263 --> 00:34:37,863
So the half life of albumin is 2 to 3 days compared to 14 to 20 days for albumin.

307
00:34:38,253 --> 00:34:45,453
So the only takeaway from that is like, okay, well it's thought that it would change more rapidly in response to changes in nutritional status.

308
00:34:45,483 --> 00:34:48,303
So is it more indicative of current nutritional status?

309
00:34:50,223 --> 00:34:56,702
But really what we find is that levels, pre albumin levels are often normal in chronically malnourished patients.

310
00:34:56,703 --> 00:35:01,703
So including those that have anorexia nervosa, we'll see a normal pre albumin,

311
00:35:01,773 --> 00:35:07,232
even patients that we know are truly malnourished and then they'll be decreased in

312
00:35:07,233 --> 00:35:11,123
patients that are well-nourished who have maybe just recently undergone surgery.

313
00:35:11,133 --> 00:35:18,292
Right. So they've had some type of stressor, injury, infection being a negative acute phase reaction.

314
00:35:18,293 --> 00:35:24,183
In response to that, the levels go down. So people that we know are well nourished but have had some type of injury.

315
00:35:24,813 --> 00:35:33,083
Their levels are lower. Right.

316
00:35:34,223 --> 00:35:39,203
Downton Abbey, although it's got a shorter half life that's more reflective of current status for an antique,

317
00:35:40,433 --> 00:35:43,523
not really because of these various factors.

318
00:35:44,543 --> 00:35:51,983
So a pre-human may be increased in somebody whose kidneys aren't functioning as well because it is degraded by the kidneys.

319
00:35:51,983 --> 00:35:57,863
So that's not functioning as well. We may see increased levels of the blood again.

320
00:35:58,013 --> 00:36:01,673
Steroids. We'll talk about steroids later in the semester.

321
00:36:03,093 --> 00:36:10,052
Came back so many things in so many different lands that we look at decreased post-operative state,

322
00:36:10,053 --> 00:36:13,473
liver disease, again, infection, stress, inflammation.

323
00:36:13,473 --> 00:36:16,923
This will falsely lower our pre albumin levels.

324
00:36:19,723 --> 00:36:23,952
So if we're concerned about inflammation, we're not going to necessarily be checking this.

325
00:36:23,953 --> 00:36:29,023
But what other acute phase reactive might be checked in conjunction with the PLB?

326
00:36:29,383 --> 00:36:37,603
Yeah. Yes, CRP. If you remember that graph that showed where as CRP goes up, the pre-op movement is going down.

327
00:36:37,603 --> 00:36:43,963
So the CRP is a positive acute phase reaction where the the pre albumin isn't negative, acute phase reactive.

328
00:36:49,313 --> 00:36:54,743
So we have looked at this. There are many surpassing randomized interventional and prospective studies that have

329
00:36:54,743 --> 00:37:00,473
demonstrated a poor relationship between serum protein levels and personal status.

330
00:37:01,523 --> 00:37:10,423
Decreased protein energy intake has not been consistent with increased serum protein, and the same is true for increased protein energy intake.

331
00:37:10,433 --> 00:37:18,433
If we want to monitor if somebody is getting adequate protein, it's not as simple as just checking therapy, albumin or albumin.

332
00:37:21,293 --> 00:37:32,303
Maybe there is maybe some utility in monitoring our trends and in certain patients, but in general, it's not helpful as part of our assessment.

333
00:37:34,263 --> 00:37:41,463
Patients with anorexia, whom we know malnutrition is indisputable, often have normal levels of these proteins and then individuals.

334
00:37:42,443 --> 00:37:53,303
That are cells post some type of stress or trauma infection inflammatory response will have often have lower or decreased levels of these proteins.

335
00:37:57,283 --> 00:38:02,683
So the take home message here is that serum protein markers are not specific or sensitive

336
00:38:02,893 --> 00:38:08,053
indicators of nutritional status greatly influenced by the inflammatory response.

337
00:38:09,103 --> 00:38:14,832
Albumin is also greatly influenced by food status, so levels are often maintained in a chronic,

338
00:38:14,833 --> 00:38:21,823
malnourished state and decrease in a wellness individual who has experienced some type of recent stressor trauma.

339
00:38:22,663 --> 00:38:28,273
So that being said, let's look at what our good friend, the lab handbook, tells us.

340
00:38:51,773 --> 00:38:53,783
Okay. Let's start with albumin.

341
00:38:54,773 --> 00:39:03,413
Again, this is like a clinical test catalog and we can pull up any lab order that can be ordered at the hospital, essentially.

342
00:39:06,223 --> 00:39:10,243
So definitely albumin is a helpful clinical tool, but it is not.

343
00:39:12,093 --> 00:39:16,563
Helpful with nutritional statements. But if we scroll down.

344
00:39:18,803 --> 00:39:21,863
And we see test usage. What's the first thing it says?

345
00:39:23,603 --> 00:39:27,233
Nutritional status. So this is still in the system.

346
00:39:28,253 --> 00:39:32,212
So a lot of medical students or even residents, they use this all the time.

347
00:39:32,213 --> 00:39:35,693
Like if they're attending, tell them, I need you to order and I'll do that.

348
00:39:35,693 --> 00:39:39,922
And maybe they're like, okay, I need to like, remember why we're ordering this.

349
00:39:39,923 --> 00:39:46,613
This is like a scenario that is maybe it wouldn't be this simplistic, but that's the first thing that pops up.

350
00:39:46,853 --> 00:39:56,093
Or if the lower the albumin is low and they look up the lab and say, oh, it's nutritional status, then you get a counselor, you know, the dietitian.

351
00:39:56,663 --> 00:40:01,133
So that still happens. Like you'll get a referral for low albumin.

352
00:40:02,913 --> 00:40:06,123
So what about the pre album? And we'll see what that one says.

353
00:40:12,143 --> 00:40:22,493
OC tests usage decreases and PE albumin may aid in detection of protein calorie malnutrition and in monitoring protein depletion.

354
00:40:23,693 --> 00:40:27,293
Decreased P albumin may also indicate liver dysfunction or acute inflammation.

355
00:40:28,313 --> 00:40:34,193
So still, this is there's still kind of like mis use of these tests.

356
00:40:34,613 --> 00:40:38,873
Okay. That's that's the only point I'm trying to show that, you know.

357
00:40:39,963 --> 00:40:48,123
This is a wonderful health system. And still we get these this constant dialog about the use of these these proteins.

358
00:40:49,443 --> 00:40:55,143
So monitoring protein depletion, that has not been shown to be true when we have like trials.

359
00:40:55,683 --> 00:41:01,363
But again, there may be some situations we're looking at a trend in a protein albumin could be helpful.

360
00:41:02,073 --> 00:41:09,093
But that's like over time, a lot of our patients, we don't have long enough to like monitor that.

361
00:41:09,093 --> 00:41:12,453
But there there could be some situations where maybe a trend is helpful,

362
00:41:12,993 --> 00:41:16,863
but it wouldn't be like directly telling us if we're giving them enough protein.

363
00:41:19,053 --> 00:41:24,483
So this is still a problem. You know, every year that I've taught this class, this language has not changed.

364
00:41:25,263 --> 00:41:32,403
Which is interesting because now we can use it in our class, but not helpful.

365
00:41:32,433 --> 00:41:38,713
We still get those referrals for those labs. Okay.

366
00:41:39,553 --> 00:41:43,363
Does anybody have any questions on those serum proteins?

367
00:41:44,723 --> 00:41:48,313
So why is. I don't know.

368
00:41:48,493 --> 00:41:53,293
I don't know who is in charge of the test usage language in our lab.

369
00:41:53,893 --> 00:42:00,323
But yeah, hardly.

370
00:42:01,513 --> 00:42:05,473
But especially the albumin. The nutritional status. That is really not.

371
00:42:05,833 --> 00:42:09,072
Not at all true. So that.

372
00:42:09,073 --> 00:42:16,513
That's a little bit frustrating. But most persons on your medical team, like they're very responsive.

373
00:42:16,723 --> 00:42:20,113
So we don't we don't really use that. We've got a lot better tools.

374
00:42:20,113 --> 00:42:26,653
Here's why. I mean, they're going to immediately understand, you know, why that's not a good tool.

375
00:42:29,123 --> 00:42:33,413
All right. So I want to spend I know this may seem a little odd to focus just on one,

376
00:42:34,533 --> 00:42:41,873
but we talked about other nutritional labs that maybe are not really even helpful with like.

377
00:42:44,923 --> 00:42:49,843
Determining the status of that vitamin and mineral. But I want to spend a little bit of time on vitamin D.

378
00:42:51,523 --> 00:42:54,523
Because there's been a period of time. It's slowed down a little bit.

379
00:42:54,523 --> 00:43:01,333
And we'll talk about why that everybody was getting off each other because anybody here had their vitamin D check,

380
00:43:03,433 --> 00:43:14,983
if you want to share, was a big blow. So if we get our vitamin D checks living in Michigan and let's say we did it in the middle of winter,

381
00:43:15,883 --> 00:43:19,553
I would guess we're all going to be considered either insufficient or deficient.

382
00:43:19,573 --> 00:43:24,053
And what does that really mean in terms of putting it into like a clinical context?

383
00:43:24,103 --> 00:43:31,803
So I want to talk about that a little bit. So for vitamin D, we do have a metabolite called the 25 HD.

384
00:43:32,613 --> 00:43:36,633
This is just the best laboratory indicator we have of vitamin D status.

385
00:43:36,673 --> 00:43:44,583
Again, it's one measure, so it's the best one we have, but it's just kind of like one metabolite.

386
00:43:46,293 --> 00:43:54,993
The reference ranges, so vitamin D deficiency would be a 25 HD, less than ten insufficiency less than 25.

387
00:43:55,203 --> 00:43:58,533
And then toxicity we don't often see.

388
00:43:59,103 --> 00:44:02,853
That would be if somebody was like maintain a very high level of supplementation.

389
00:44:03,783 --> 00:44:09,683
You're not likely to be vitamin D toxic if you're like a lifeguard in the summer.

390
00:44:09,703 --> 00:44:15,283
Like you're not you're not gonna be toxic on your vitamin D levels, even if you have really good sun exposure.

391
00:44:16,083 --> 00:44:19,323
So this optimum levels is between 30 and 80.

392
00:44:21,663 --> 00:44:26,193
Just for reference, you don't have to memorize these just so we're as we're talking through some of this.

393
00:44:27,033 --> 00:44:32,433
So we see lots of requests or orders for 25 HD levels in our patients.

394
00:44:33,753 --> 00:44:38,583
If you look online, you know, vitamin D deficiency is like an epidemic.

395
00:44:41,133 --> 00:44:49,983
Some may say this is older, but it's most up to date. Only about 23% of U.S. adolescents and adults have serum levels greater than 30.

396
00:44:49,983 --> 00:44:54,243
So in that optimal range, that's like only a quarter of the population.

397
00:44:54,873 --> 00:44:57,723
So that seems potentially really problematic.

398
00:44:59,583 --> 00:45:04,983
The main concentration of vitamin D across the world is about 20, which would be considered insufficient.

399
00:45:05,823 --> 00:45:10,413
And we do see more variation within countries than between countries.

400
00:45:10,443 --> 00:45:17,073
So it's not just like a geographical thing, although we do see.

401
00:45:18,493 --> 00:45:21,913
Can you see some differences depending on the distance from the equator?

402
00:45:23,383 --> 00:45:31,393
But something is going on here. And we have these persistent headlines linking so many benefits with vitamin D.

403
00:45:31,393 --> 00:45:38,713
If you Google Vitamin D benefits, I mean, you would find it helps with everything, which maybe is true.

404
00:45:38,743 --> 00:45:42,552
Like our most organ systems in our body have vitamin D receptors.

405
00:45:42,553 --> 00:45:47,383
So we know that it is involved with a lot of the how our body operates.

406
00:45:50,913 --> 00:45:56,013
But interpreting the lab value is not always straightforward.

407
00:45:57,873 --> 00:46:06,963
So a couple of years ago, Michigan Medicine implemented what's called a soft stop in our electronic medical records.

408
00:46:06,993 --> 00:46:17,103
So if a physician or maybe the dietitian on behalf of the physician puts in an order for 25 HD before it just goes through the lab would be fine.

409
00:46:18,153 --> 00:46:25,293
Now we get this. It's called what's called the soft stuff. It's like a thing that pops up that says, Do you really need to order this lab?

410
00:46:25,363 --> 00:46:34,323
Like, here, here's some information. So if you are concerned about vitamin D insufficiency or mild deficiency, do not need to test it.

411
00:46:34,443 --> 00:46:41,343
What it says. You may safely start maintenance therapy of 2000 international units of Vitamin D3 daily.

412
00:46:42,633 --> 00:46:46,053
So it's basically saying if you suspect your patient is deficient,

413
00:46:47,343 --> 00:46:52,893
mildly deficient are insufficient, just go ahead and serve them on 2000 units of vitamin D.

414
00:46:53,733 --> 00:46:59,373
If you high clinical suspicion for vitamin D deficiency, you still don't need to test.

415
00:46:59,393 --> 00:47:02,403
You can just start depletion at 50,000.

416
00:47:02,403 --> 00:47:05,943
I use weekly and then begin a maintenance dose of 2000.

417
00:47:07,023 --> 00:47:11,793
I use daily without diagnostic or confirmatory testing after completion.

418
00:47:12,783 --> 00:47:17,313
So what do you guys think of this? Like in the age of precision medicine?

419
00:47:17,883 --> 00:47:23,373
This is basically just saying, don't order this lab, just start them on supplementation.

420
00:47:24,993 --> 00:47:41,293
They may have some from this. Yeah.

421
00:47:41,303 --> 00:47:51,443
I think this is a situation where most people, especially in this state, probably going to come back insufficient or deficient.

422
00:47:52,253 --> 00:47:59,452
What does that really mean? It's not that these levels of insufficiency have correlated with hip fractures.

423
00:47:59,453 --> 00:48:03,503
We actually find the opposite. We don't really see rickets that much anymore.

424
00:48:03,503 --> 00:48:07,763
So, you know, we have this measure that we're using to assess.

425
00:48:07,763 --> 00:48:12,473
But he says that it's telling us most people are do not have enough yet.

426
00:48:13,043 --> 00:48:20,003
The health outcomes that we would traditionally link with very poor vitamin D status don't kind of correspond.

427
00:48:20,003 --> 00:48:21,793
Now that's just speaking very broadly.

428
00:48:21,983 --> 00:48:33,083
So a median dose of like 2000 or natural units of vitamin D3, that's the kind you can buy over the counter is probably safe for most people.

429
00:48:34,073 --> 00:48:39,893
That's not going to cause vitamin D toxicity. It might not be enough for replacement for some folks.

430
00:48:42,233 --> 00:48:47,603
What about this 50,000 IU? This is where they take it once a day for a couple of weeks.

431
00:48:50,133 --> 00:48:54,493
Do you think that some people continue to take this beyond the eight weeks?

432
00:48:54,513 --> 00:49:03,673
Yes. So once a week, 50,000 weekly news like this is all this is a prescription.

433
00:49:04,833 --> 00:49:10,023
But how often do you think patients stop taking it after they.

434
00:49:12,063 --> 00:49:15,783
Or the physician tells. Sometimes this stays on board.

435
00:49:16,923 --> 00:49:22,293
Kind of indefinitely. More patients take it daily instead of weekly.

436
00:49:23,043 --> 00:49:28,532
So there is a little bit of issue potentially with the 15,000 as long as it's prescribed appropriately,

437
00:49:28,533 --> 00:49:33,423
but sometimes, you know, it's prescribed and then the patient doesn't have follow up and then they're taking it.

438
00:49:34,313 --> 00:49:42,933
They take it for a while. That potentially could lead to some problems just with toxicity, but, you know, not common.

439
00:49:42,933 --> 00:49:46,803
But that's something maybe we'd want to be a little bit more careful with.

440
00:49:46,833 --> 00:49:50,913
So we have this stuff, soft stuff, basically saying, don't order this, you can just start it.

441
00:49:51,693 --> 00:50:00,023
Still, it gets ordered a lot. So what is some of the research behind the health claims we see with vitamin D?

442
00:50:01,613 --> 00:50:06,473
Really strong research showing consistent benefits of vitamin D supplementation is lacking.

443
00:50:06,483 --> 00:50:12,113
So there are lots of good studies that have been well conducted,

444
00:50:12,113 --> 00:50:21,202
trials that have looked at the benefits of vitamin D and haven't seen a whole lot in terms that we'll talk about where we know it is beneficial.

445
00:50:21,203 --> 00:50:25,313
But some of them maybe are not. They've been criticized.

446
00:50:25,433 --> 00:50:28,342
The studies aren't long enough. So we really don't know the effect.

447
00:50:28,343 --> 00:50:33,953
But we don't have a good, really great body of research for the benefits of vitamin D supplementation.

448
00:50:35,843 --> 00:50:39,863
Vitamin D as an exposure can be difficult to control.

449
00:50:40,463 --> 00:50:43,853
Can anybody tell me why that might be?

450
00:50:45,713 --> 00:50:50,093
If we're trying to measure someone's exposure to light. Yeah.

451
00:50:53,663 --> 00:50:58,233
Yeah, right. Because you can get vitamin D from diet supplements, sun exposure.

452
00:50:58,253 --> 00:51:05,003
So to really fully capture that can be difficult, of course, in like a randomized trial where we're doing supplementation.

453
00:51:05,573 --> 00:51:09,472
Yes, you can do that. People are randomized to certain amounts and hopefully they take it.

454
00:51:09,473 --> 00:51:14,573
But full exposure is hard because we have different sources.

455
00:51:16,423 --> 00:51:19,843
He says that. A lot of fun stuff.

456
00:51:21,013 --> 00:51:33,383
And they don't feel that. So that's another activation in the two.

457
00:51:33,843 --> 00:51:40,373
So yeah, if you measure the exposure that you will get and how well we do that.

458
00:51:41,493 --> 00:51:51,003
Yeah, exactly. So vitamin D is an exposure for various reasons, difficult to control during this difficult study.

459
00:51:51,033 --> 00:51:54,153
A lot of these are observational design, which is great.

460
00:51:54,183 --> 00:52:02,793
We love perspective observational studies, but when you have an exposure that can be wildly different and difficult to capture,

461
00:52:03,273 --> 00:52:10,143
sometimes in a study outside of nursing, it can be difficult to really get a good, good idea of what that exposure is.

462
00:52:11,753 --> 00:52:15,173
And something that, you know, is always questioned with with things like this.

463
00:52:15,173 --> 00:52:24,473
Does high dose vitamin D make people healthier or are healthier people doing the sorts of things that raise their vitamin D,

464
00:52:24,503 --> 00:52:30,443
like our people that go outside and go for a walk or are physically active and get their sun exposure.

465
00:52:30,443 --> 00:52:39,593
They're doing these healthy behaviors and subsequently raising their vitamin D, but is it those other activities that are leading to improved health?

466
00:52:40,073 --> 00:52:50,893
It's hard to determine that. And that's kind of like the what came first, the disease or the deficiency.

467
00:52:50,923 --> 00:52:57,023
So just a couple of studies I want to touch on. There was a study, this was back in 2009 now.

468
00:52:57,043 --> 00:53:06,493
So quite, quite a ways back. But at a medical center in Utah and found that heart failure was 90% more common in those

469
00:53:06,493 --> 00:53:13,093
with the lowest vitamin D levels versus the highest and previous heart attack was 81%.

470
00:53:13,093 --> 00:53:20,563
More likely in stroke was 51% more likely in those with the lowest vitamin D levels compared to those with the highest.

471
00:53:22,503 --> 00:53:30,032
So what wasn't really confirmed in this study is, okay, are they experiencing these things because of low vitamin D?

472
00:53:30,033 --> 00:53:34,263
Like do we see more heart failure because these patients are vitamin D deficient?

473
00:53:35,343 --> 00:53:38,613
Or is the vitamin D level low because of these conditions?

474
00:53:38,613 --> 00:53:47,613
Like if you have heart failure, which we will get into heart failure, you're at the kind of point in a disease where your heart is failing.

475
00:53:48,063 --> 00:53:51,573
These patients are sick. These patients are not getting outside as much.

476
00:53:51,573 --> 00:53:58,863
They're often hospitalized. So are they not able to get outside, not able to get exercise?

477
00:53:58,863 --> 00:54:05,403
The types of things that maybe enhance vitamin D, that wasn't really determined in a study like that.

478
00:54:06,093 --> 00:54:10,922
Also, obesity, excess fat.

479
00:54:10,923 --> 00:54:14,552
So excess adiposity will hold on to vitamin D.

480
00:54:14,553 --> 00:54:22,083
It's a fat soluble vitamins, so it's not used as efficiently in the body among our overweight and obese patients.

481
00:54:22,563 --> 00:54:29,433
So in this case, is low vitamin D just a marker of obesity or is vitamin D just a marker of poor health?

482
00:54:29,433 --> 00:54:34,983
It's it's really hard to kind of weed out the true effect here.

483
00:54:36,973 --> 00:54:42,223
So do these conditions improve or does the risk lower with supplementation of vitamin D?

484
00:54:42,223 --> 00:54:47,803
That has not been shown to be the case. Or if they get adequate sun exposure,

485
00:54:48,073 --> 00:54:56,563
I think we just we have to get some better studies to show this temporality and really understand the relationship with vitamin D here.

486
00:54:57,553 --> 00:55:03,043
There was a study that recently wrapped up called the vitamin D and Omega three trial.

487
00:55:03,053 --> 00:55:12,553
This was called the Vital Study. And this was looking at of taking 2000 international units of vitamin D and or fish oil tablets.

488
00:55:12,553 --> 00:55:20,233
So I think they have different groups, reduces the risk of cancer, heart disease and stroke in persons that currently don't have those conditions.

489
00:55:20,833 --> 00:55:27,013
Those results were not found to see a benefit from vitamin D supplementation.

490
00:55:27,253 --> 00:55:30,823
I think there was some maybe in some very specific populations.

491
00:55:32,203 --> 00:55:35,113
So that was like kind of the study we were waiting on.

492
00:55:35,143 --> 00:55:42,702
Again, some of the criticism of vitamin D proponents was that it wasn't long term enough to really assess those outcomes.

493
00:55:42,703 --> 00:55:54,343
But so far, the literature hasn't really been strong to support vitamin D supplementation as a means to maybe prevent disease.

494
00:55:56,953 --> 00:56:04,033
So there really is no consensus yet. But adults who do not have regular, effective sun exposure year round,

495
00:56:04,153 --> 00:56:10,963
it's probably good to recommend they consume at least 600 800 international to vitamin D3 a day.

496
00:56:12,373 --> 00:56:16,573
High risk groups like the ones we see in the hospital probably would need a little bit more.

497
00:56:19,023 --> 00:56:24,543
We take it vitamin D from the diet. Talk about that. But it's really hard to get enough from the diet alone.

498
00:56:27,353 --> 00:56:30,683
So let's see what the Institute of Medicine has concluded.

499
00:56:32,393 --> 00:56:37,523
Scientific evidence indicates that calcium and vitamin D play key roles in bone health.

500
00:56:37,823 --> 00:56:42,203
The current evidence does not support other benefits for vitamin D or calcium intake.

501
00:56:43,013 --> 00:56:45,173
More targeted research should continue.

502
00:56:45,383 --> 00:56:50,753
Higher levels have not been shown to confer greater benefits, and in fact, they have been linked to other health problems.

503
00:56:51,353 --> 00:56:53,062
Challenging the concept more is better,

504
00:56:53,063 --> 00:57:01,013
and we see this often when we're talking about supplements like very high doses of a supplement sometimes are not beneficial.

505
00:57:01,013 --> 00:57:02,993
We can actually see some adverse outcomes.

506
00:57:04,253 --> 00:57:12,023
So the evidence supporting benefit of vitamin D and extra skeletal outcomes was inconsistent and inconclusive.

507
00:57:12,023 --> 00:57:17,603
Meaning we know the benefit in bone health that's not disputed, but all these other claims.

508
00:57:18,593 --> 00:57:21,983
There really isn't a ton of evidence to support that.

509
00:57:24,063 --> 00:57:27,813
And therefore cannot serve as basis for dietary reference intake development.

510
00:57:30,073 --> 00:57:37,813
So the Institute of Medicine concluded that a serum 25 HCA concentration of 20 is sufficient for most individuals.

511
00:57:37,843 --> 00:57:46,233
So if you get your 25 HD level back and it's 20 that it's flagged because it's below that 30 for most people, that's the.

512
00:57:46,763 --> 00:57:55,763
I mean, that may even be normal. Most people have adequate amounts of vitamin D in the blood supplied by their diets and natural sources like the sun.

513
00:57:56,003 --> 00:58:00,533
So for most people taking extra calcium, vitamin D may not be warranted.

514
00:58:02,153 --> 00:58:06,023
I think there's maybe a case to just take like a maintenance dose.

515
00:58:06,953 --> 00:58:13,463
It can be hard to get in the diet. So that's my you know, my opinion on that is a little different from that.

516
00:58:15,783 --> 00:58:23,943
But what does it mean for us health practitioners that are going to that don't really deal with most people or the healthy general population?

517
00:58:24,633 --> 00:58:29,923
How do we approach this? We do have some guys.

518
00:58:29,923 --> 00:58:34,353
This is not the most updated table for dosing guidelines.

519
00:58:34,363 --> 00:58:44,412
So I'm just giving you example, you'd never have to use this kind of this class, but we do have some dosing guidance based on serum level.

520
00:58:44,413 --> 00:58:49,962
So, you know, is this perfect precision medicine just using the serum level?

521
00:58:49,963 --> 00:58:53,503
And then in dosing, we want to ask more questions.

522
00:58:53,503 --> 00:58:59,173
But this can be like a quick guide in terms of how we might approach supplementation.

523
00:59:03,873 --> 00:59:08,353
Okay. This is like a very simplistic. Illustration.

524
00:59:09,703 --> 00:59:15,913
Our guys are really good again about trying to maintain homeostasis and they'll kind of fight for that.

525
00:59:17,173 --> 00:59:25,582
So let's say this is our cell. This is circulating vitamin D and these triangles and these are vitamin C receptors

526
00:59:25,583 --> 00:59:29,723
on the cell which move cells and our organ systems have receptors for right?

527
00:59:31,763 --> 00:59:35,992
So in times of deficiency or in adequate vitamin D,

528
00:59:35,993 --> 00:59:43,673
we can see that our cells are really smart enough to put out more receptors to try and grab onto the available

529
00:59:43,673 --> 00:59:51,332
vitamin D that's there as well and then be bombarded by a lot of supplement supplemental vitamin D.

530
00:59:51,333 --> 00:59:55,072
And you can see it's kind of acting the other way.

531
00:59:55,073 --> 01:00:04,642
So it's going to take away some of those receptors. And even when we have plentiful vitamin D is a is a tend not to take in too much.

532
01:00:04,643 --> 01:00:11,243
So our body is very smart and we'll do whatever it takes to make use of what is available.

533
01:00:14,063 --> 01:00:17,632
So when we flood our system with high dose vitamin D supplementation,

534
01:00:17,633 --> 01:00:22,343
our cells will decrease the number of receptors and become less sensitive to vitamin D.

535
01:00:22,343 --> 01:00:31,413
This is called Downregulation. So, you know, over supplementation maybe is not the best thing.

536
01:00:31,743 --> 01:00:38,783
And that's I would say that's for any vitamin and mineral. So what can we do?

537
01:00:38,813 --> 01:00:44,693
Well, of course, I'm going to say consult the dietitian, because we can provide some more specific guidance.

538
01:00:45,323 --> 01:00:51,323
So combining lab data and a comprehensive nutrition assessment can help guide appropriate next steps.

539
01:00:51,323 --> 01:00:57,833
So we want to take into account not just their 25 HD level, but their sun exposure.

540
01:00:58,013 --> 01:01:01,913
Do they use sunscreen? Do they cover up with long sleeves?

541
01:01:02,763 --> 01:01:06,983
You know, even I think it's reported 10 minutes in the sun,

542
01:01:07,253 --> 01:01:16,643
a day where you have just your arms exposed without clothing or sunscreen is generally enough vitamin D exposure.

543
01:01:18,573 --> 01:01:23,123
Obviously we don't get that for many months living here.

544
01:01:23,133 --> 01:01:29,193
But do you want to take into account sun exposure, dietary intake of foods rich in vitamin D?

545
01:01:29,193 --> 01:01:34,803
Are those fortified with vitamin D? Does anybody know foods that naturally contain vitamin D?

546
01:01:38,233 --> 01:01:47,383
Yeah. Egg yolks will have some fish and some fish and.

547
01:01:50,163 --> 01:01:57,303
Okay. Well, I did not know that you did do a 5 minutes minute, read his appropriation and become.

548
01:01:59,803 --> 01:02:05,623
Okay. So not a whole lot of like natural food sources of vitamin D.

549
01:02:06,223 --> 01:02:08,383
Yes. Or fortified foods, of course.

550
01:02:10,663 --> 01:02:18,043
But in my opinion, in just being working clinically, it is hard, in my opinion, to get adequate vitamin D from diet.

551
01:02:18,283 --> 01:02:25,983
And that's why I would say if you are going to take like a daily maintenance supplement, vitamin D in Michigan is probably good,

552
01:02:25,993 --> 01:02:30,223
I guess, but maybe just in the fall and winter months too, and you can back off in the summer.

553
01:02:31,813 --> 01:02:38,323
We want to replace or always repeat and then hopefully maintain at a good level and we may not need as much as we think.

554
01:02:41,253 --> 01:02:47,823
So this is something I used just, you know, with parents because I work with kids that have food allergies,

555
01:02:48,233 --> 01:02:53,153
know have very significant peanut milk or soy.

556
01:02:53,163 --> 01:03:01,953
So we all the point of this is like these are fortified milk and plant based milk products that are fine fortified.

557
01:03:03,003 --> 01:03:09,152
And you can see this is per eight ounces of they're all pretty similar and that's still

558
01:03:09,153 --> 01:03:15,033
kind of low like you would have to if most of us need at least like 800 international.

559
01:03:15,083 --> 01:03:22,363
It's a vitamin D. You're only getting about 100 from some of these fortified products or as calcium.

560
01:03:22,363 --> 01:03:28,302
Yes, we can definitely get adequate calcium from fortified foods, vitamin D, not as much.

561
01:03:28,303 --> 01:03:33,373
And you're seeing more and more things fortified with vitamin D, but it's usually not an adequate amount.

562
01:03:36,863 --> 01:03:41,062
Other considerations for our patients, skin pigmentation.

563
01:03:41,063 --> 01:03:50,603
So if we look at 17 data, again, we find that 97% of African Americans in the U.S. are considered deficient by those cutoff levels.

564
01:03:50,603 --> 01:03:55,373
I mean, that's that's nearly the entire population that was sampled.

565
01:03:56,693 --> 01:04:05,603
So that's that's something to consider as well talked about are these patients may not be able to utilize vitamin D as well.

566
01:04:07,013 --> 01:04:12,653
Patients that are hospitalized or institutionalized that don't get that sun exposure are at risk.

567
01:04:14,723 --> 01:04:18,563
Again, talk about protective clothing, use of sunscreens that they already have,

568
01:04:18,563 --> 01:04:24,413
osteoporosis, certain malabsorption conditions as well could increase vitamin D needs.

569
01:04:30,603 --> 01:04:34,413
Is that based on what kind of test result? Probably the 25.

570
01:04:37,033 --> 01:04:43,213
Actually for the American population, the transport amount is different than ours.

571
01:04:43,603 --> 01:04:46,873
So I don't need to take too much public transport so much longer.

572
01:04:47,593 --> 01:04:52,923
Okay. So they might not need as much. I know from sun exposure.

573
01:04:52,933 --> 01:04:58,603
There is less absorption and you have darker transports.

574
01:05:01,483 --> 01:05:08,083
Okay. So what does this really mean to be deficient or insufficient with regard to vitamin D status?

575
01:05:09,163 --> 01:05:12,413
I don't know. Do we really know? It's probably different for everybody.

576
01:05:12,433 --> 01:05:18,913
It would be my take home message. So take those 25 HD results with a grain of salt.

577
01:05:19,183 --> 01:05:22,933
If they come back low, that's kind of normal.

578
01:05:23,383 --> 01:05:28,573
And then you can repeat and maintain. But consider the whole picture, not just the lab value.

579
01:05:30,363 --> 01:05:32,413
And so look at the entire clinical picture.

580
01:05:33,613 --> 01:05:40,483
So it's a lot of time on vitamin D, but I just want you you will see lots of patients that have those levels drawn.

581
01:05:40,873 --> 01:05:45,063
They come back low and then you get the page or the referral to.

582
01:05:46,913 --> 01:05:52,413
And offer some guidance. That's actually all I have to do.

583
01:05:52,443 --> 01:05:55,953
Does anybody have any questions on what we've covered so far?

584
01:05:58,673 --> 01:06:06,833
Yeah I'm mean for people with more fat on their bodies are using or with supplementation of vitamin D help in that way or with that.

585
01:06:06,923 --> 01:06:13,943
Yeah. It just they might need higher doses to see a response in like moving that.

586
01:06:13,943 --> 01:06:21,083
25 00i know. That's what I would say is they might need more in terms of the.

587
01:06:27,593 --> 01:06:32,373
Any other questions? Okay.

588
01:06:32,383 --> 01:06:36,702
Well, we got through like this first third of the semester.

589
01:06:36,703 --> 01:06:39,853
We'll call it tests on Tuesday.

590
01:06:39,863 --> 01:06:43,002
Don't stress, but make sure you prepare so you're not, like, panicking,

591
01:06:43,003 --> 01:06:49,363
trying to flip through things in real time and then we'll we'll pick up on Thursday.

592
01:06:49,783 --> 01:06:53,713
Okay. The question then.

593
01:06:54,633 --> 01:07:00,273
He is one of the. It'll be both.

594
01:07:00,273 --> 01:07:06,213
So there'll be some multiple choice, some sort of answer. And I believe a short piece of himself has to come together.

595
01:07:07,683 --> 01:07:15,962
But, yeah, it's a little about. Some of the slides I would fault.

596
01:07:15,963 --> 01:07:21,443
I always say focus on the slides like what I present to you in class is what I find most pertinent.

597
01:07:21,453 --> 01:07:27,633
If there's something in the slides that's like not quite clicking, then maybe refer back to the reading to get a little bit better understanding.

598
01:07:27,633 --> 01:07:31,493
But really it's. You know, kind of what we covered last.

599
01:07:32,293 --> 01:07:37,653
How many patients? I don't know yet. I thought, okay, I know that.

600
01:07:38,213 --> 01:07:43,203
Yeah, well, if you want to go back and forth the questions or is it like once you done the question, you.

601
01:07:43,903 --> 01:07:53,923
Oh, good question. This is I like being able to go back the first year I locked it so you couldn't and oh, students are not like that.

602
01:07:53,923 --> 01:07:57,343
So yes, I don't think I have it locked.

603
01:07:57,343 --> 01:08:00,613
I just ask you, please just do this on your own.

604
01:08:00,973 --> 01:08:08,713
You have all these resources to go back, you know, plug it for later or whatever, but just make sure you do it on your own.

605
01:08:09,223 --> 01:08:15,553
Okay. So I will not back down. I got a lot of trouble doing that one here, so I want to do that.
