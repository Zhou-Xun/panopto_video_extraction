1
00:00:03,830 --> 00:00:07,500
I was doing my life.

2
00:00:09,150 --> 00:00:13,020
That's what I'm trying to say. Is that already?

3
00:00:14,110 --> 00:00:36,839
Now I just want to make sure that this is my first three years connected because I'm doing that same research.

4
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:49,030
We're now all sort of moving on to the first thing we're going to do today and before,

5
00:00:50,220 --> 00:00:57,300
and then we're going to go through learning, which is a group environment where you will.

6
00:00:59,390 --> 00:01:02,270
From a survey of suggested topics,

7
00:01:02,270 --> 00:01:13,220
and then you will be put into a group if you choose a paper and research paper to work from over time through the rest of the semester.

8
00:01:17,810 --> 00:01:21,090
First for the first question, the answer.

9
00:01:21,830 --> 00:01:27,560
The U.S. federal government plays a role in collecting data used by epidemiologists.

10
00:01:27,620 --> 00:01:28,700
This is true.

11
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:40,450
For the statement that there is no need to collect new data nowadays because so much epidemiologic data are available in the public domain.

12
00:01:41,170 --> 00:01:51,450
This is, of course, false. This tier program is used frequently by epidemiologists to understand cancer cervical.

13
00:01:53,860 --> 00:02:00,280
The statement that the US federal government decide which diseases are reportable is false.

14
00:02:00,280 --> 00:02:07,950
And we had a question about that. So. For notifiable reportable diseases.

15
00:02:08,220 --> 00:02:14,040
It is primarily a collaboration between state health departments and the CDC.

16
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:21,900
These are based on state legislations and regulations and federal regulations,

17
00:02:22,650 --> 00:02:29,640
although they collaborate with other states and the CDC is not based on federal law but state.

18
00:02:37,610 --> 00:02:43,070
And the following sources are useful to find people to participate in epidemiologic studies.

19
00:02:43,730 --> 00:02:48,440
These will be hospitals, disease registries, radio advertisements and friends.

20
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:54,320
If you can find people, then check them out and see if they're eligible.

21
00:02:57,050 --> 00:03:01,370
Which of the following are reasonable sources of data for epidemiologic studies?

22
00:03:02,240 --> 00:03:06,950
Personal Fitness Tracking Information. We may have the Fitbit and Apple Watch.

23
00:03:07,070 --> 00:03:14,170
Galaxy Watch. Vital statistics, medical records and laboratory results.

24
00:03:14,530 --> 00:03:18,610
These are all good sources, reasonable sources of data.

25
00:03:20,050 --> 00:03:26,260
A physician in Oakland County, Michigan, informing the local health department of a case of West Nile virus.

26
00:03:27,230 --> 00:03:33,380
Is an example of active surveillance that is false is not active surveillance.

27
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:47,600
If you observe an abrupt increase in mortality for a particular disease, a possible explanation could be the definition of the disease as changed.

28
00:03:49,130 --> 00:03:53,510
There may be a new treatment for the disease that results in cure for many people.

29
00:03:55,020 --> 00:04:01,080
Or there is a screening test that results in early detection of disease that results in prolonged survival.

30
00:04:02,130 --> 00:04:08,770
Those are all possible. Observation cues for seeing a decrease in mortality.

31
00:04:11,450 --> 00:04:18,980
This year, we're using life insurance statistics to understand morbidity is that the data may not be reflective of the general population.

32
00:04:19,970 --> 00:04:25,790
Assume that healthy people are more likely to get life insurance, even though everyone in the population is eligible.

33
00:04:27,020 --> 00:04:35,960
True, especially in regions that are able to most able to purchase life insurance that would be employed.

34
00:04:41,310 --> 00:04:47,520
Individual physicians have the legal right to report, to not report in case of a reportable disease.

35
00:04:48,150 --> 00:04:56,870
If the patient asks him or her not to. This is false because the disease being reportable requires the physicians to report.

36
00:05:01,390 --> 00:05:10,740
For the. For today's exercise, you will work in small groups, as I said before, within the shared content area of interest.

37
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:18,379
To identify a peer reviewed scientific article of interest to your group will examine the

38
00:05:18,380 --> 00:05:24,020
recruitment and data collection strategy described in a peer reviewed scientific article.

39
00:05:26,130 --> 00:05:34,740
And so sources for that could be like the library or augments if you're familiar with these and identify

40
00:05:34,740 --> 00:05:40,830
and contain key components of the study's participant group recruitment and data collection measures.

41
00:05:42,710 --> 00:05:52,460
We will be using this at other points in the semester. We will use it to critically evaluate the epidemiologic topics and methods covered later on.

42
00:05:53,490 --> 00:05:59,309
And you identify and contain components of the studies, exposure, outcome,

43
00:05:59,310 --> 00:06:05,520
measurement and other methods when you're choosing something to work on going forward.

44
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:14,780
What you're doing. And then 5 minutes go to your assignments and click on Engage Learning three.

45
00:06:15,290 --> 00:06:20,390
There should also be a link to this under a week five that will take you to engage learning three.

46
00:06:22,260 --> 00:06:25,980
The exercise will be due 30 minutes after discussion and usual.

47
00:06:27,540 --> 00:06:32,160
But first, we need to report the area of interest.

48
00:06:33,260 --> 00:06:40,140
So if you can please go to this slide and show off the survey and see which category you would like to choose from.

49
00:06:56,699 --> 00:07:00,069
We have 42 people or 41 cosponsors.

50
00:07:00,549 --> 00:07:03,669
So I know somebody who's not here is loving psychology.

51
00:07:04,989 --> 00:07:09,099
And we have a couple of categories that will need to form two groups.

52
00:07:09,099 --> 00:07:16,689
One, those will be cancer, chronic health, mental health and nutrition.

53
00:07:18,009 --> 00:07:21,869
Those are fairly large groups and can be split twice.

54
00:07:21,879 --> 00:07:25,249
Four and five, five and six is.

55
00:07:26,229 --> 00:07:36,229
As we. For the duration of one of those defining racial disparities or to.

56
00:07:40,419 --> 00:07:44,729
Are there any others that might be interested in those topics that are chosen?

57
00:07:44,739 --> 00:07:49,239
One of the more common. I or.

58
00:07:52,629 --> 00:07:56,709
Possibly people would want to work together on those topics.

59
00:08:03,009 --> 00:08:06,908
If not, then it can be discussed with Dr. Buxton.

60
00:08:06,909 --> 00:08:12,039
And that is a passion you're looking to investigate during the course.

61
00:08:14,079 --> 00:08:25,989
So I would go ahead and look into that, but also kind of work with a different group just in case she does of wants one person and a group.

62
00:08:28,609 --> 00:08:31,879
So you're sickly.

63
00:08:31,879 --> 00:08:37,699
I guess the best way to do this is rearrange seating arrangements.

64
00:08:40,279 --> 00:08:44,689
To me. Sort of an image sensor.

65
00:08:45,249 --> 00:08:55,749
Can you find each other? I'm sure it's easy to forget.

66
00:08:56,479 --> 00:09:03,759
I'm sorry. It's okay.

67
00:09:10,659 --> 00:09:18,188
Yeah. You're supposed to get into. It's not just about whether you're talking to me anymore.

68
00:09:18,189 --> 00:09:57,876
To choose your experience with my story is to do like this over and over and over again from comic book ideas.
