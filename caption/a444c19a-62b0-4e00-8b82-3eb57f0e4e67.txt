2
00:00:07,272 --> 00:00:08,196
I hope after this discussion,

3
00:00:08,196 --> 00:00:10,460
you've developed a strong interest
in environmental health sciences.

4
00:00:10,460 --> 00:00:14,000
It's an incredibly satisfying and
rewarding profession, and I would

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,900
encourage you to reach out and connect
with the University of Michigan School of

6
00:00:17,900 --> 00:00:21,290
Public Health Department of
Environmental Health Sciences.

7
00:00:21,290 --> 00:00:26,160
The department has a number of programs
in industrial hygiene, occupational and

8
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:30,760
environmental epidemiology, toxicology,
environmental quality and health.

9
00:00:30,760 --> 00:00:36,650
Again, a very rich and varied set of
research and courses that you can take.

10
00:00:36,650 --> 00:00:39,860
It's an incredibly good opportunity
to learn more about environmental

11
00:00:39,860 --> 00:00:44,160
health sciences which hopefully
you'll agree after listening to this

12
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:48,310
has a very strong connection to
virtually every aspect of your life.

13
00:00:48,310 --> 00:00:52,110
So with that, I hope you recognize how
important environmental health sciences

14
00:00:52,110 --> 00:00:55,095
is within the field of public health and
how it touches,

15
00:00:55,095 --> 00:00:58,695
truly, on every aspect of
all of our daily lives.

16
00:00:58,695 --> 00:01:02,209
We've included some resources here for
you, if you're interested in learning more

17
00:01:02,209 --> 00:01:05,432
about environmental health from places
like the World Health Organization or

18
00:01:05,432 --> 00:01:07,504
the Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention.

19
00:01:07,504 --> 00:01:10,202
And I'd also like to mention
that there's a very rich and

20
00:01:10,202 --> 00:01:14,248
active Department of Environmental Health
Sciences in the School of Public Health at

21
00:01:14,248 --> 00:01:15,670
the University of Michigan.

22
00:01:15,670 --> 00:01:19,778
We have faculty and students who are
studying things like industrial hygiene,

23
00:01:19,778 --> 00:01:23,276
occupational and environmental
epidemiology, toxicology, and

24
00:01:23,276 --> 00:01:25,590
environmental quality and health.

25
00:01:25,590 --> 00:01:29,540
So, hopefully if some of these topics have
resonated with you, you will reach out and

26
00:01:29,540 --> 00:01:32,380
get in touch with the Department
of Environmental Health Sciences.

27
00:01:32,380 --> 00:01:34,230
Again, you can't go wrong
in public health and

28
00:01:34,230 --> 00:01:37,020
this is just one way that you can
connect with public health and

29
00:01:37,020 --> 00:01:42,269
become an active and meaningful
practitioner and change people's lives.
