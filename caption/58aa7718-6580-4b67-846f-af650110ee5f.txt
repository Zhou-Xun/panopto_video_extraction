1
00:00:02,490 --> 00:00:09,840
Huh? All right. Well, folks, welcome. This is our last time together. It's been great meeting with you throughout the semester.

2
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:19,560
I hope it's been enlightening to see all the different forms of injury expertise that we have on and around campus and through our broader network.

3
00:00:19,980 --> 00:00:21,870
To learn a little bit about this field, because, again,

4
00:00:21,870 --> 00:00:28,260
I wouldn't say this is part of your standard public health curriculum necessarily, even within health behavior and other education.

5
00:00:28,980 --> 00:00:36,030
Yet one of the goals of this course is just to let folks know that this is a big issue and it affects a lot of different disciplines,

6
00:00:36,030 --> 00:00:39,600
a lot of different areas where there is opportunity for impact.

7
00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:45,800
And having that kind of the front of our consciousness can be, um,

8
00:00:45,930 --> 00:00:50,670
I think is a big step in trying to reduce the burden throughout the, throughout the country.

9
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:54,840
So for today, I don't know what I'd call it.

10
00:00:55,560 --> 00:01:03,090
I want to sit here and lecture at you again. This is you've had 15 weeks of me lecturing at you with some with some guests as well.

11
00:01:03,720 --> 00:01:11,190
But at the same time, I thought it might be worth rehashing some of the the key points or things that I would like you to take away from the course.

12
00:01:11,190 --> 00:01:17,299
But rather than me explaining that to you, I'd love to just hear your reactions.

13
00:01:17,300 --> 00:01:27,510
So what I'm gonna do is I'm going to put stuff up on this PowerPoint slide thing, and I want you just so you tell me and I'm happy to, to talk at you.

14
00:01:27,510 --> 00:01:33,240
But I'd rather have I'd rather have this be more discussion based after last class,

15
00:01:33,870 --> 00:01:39,540
a few of us hung around and there was just this nice little conversation, nice lawns around fire and stuff.

16
00:01:39,930 --> 00:01:42,750
But you have a lot to say.

17
00:01:43,230 --> 00:01:51,000
And I want to I'd be very curious to see how folks are thinking about the class more holistically than a specific topic area.

18
00:01:51,660 --> 00:01:57,210
So we'll talk a little bit about that and then I'm sure we'll be done early and I'll let folks decide how you want to spend your time.

19
00:01:57,510 --> 00:02:03,840
If you have some of your project members here and you wanna spend some of the time meeting with them and making sure that you're on,

20
00:02:04,290 --> 00:02:09,210
you're all set for your final project, which is due next Thursday?

21
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:14,160
Yeah, next Thursday. That's fine for me.

22
00:02:15,060 --> 00:02:20,550
The last thing before I get started, this is just the second time that I've been able to offer this course,

23
00:02:21,150 --> 00:02:27,030
which means that it's still a work in progress. I would love if you do fill out the little courses of all things.

24
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:32,130
I know you got all the reading stuff that you're supposed to do, but there are those open comment boxes.

25
00:02:32,370 --> 00:02:39,390
And more than anything, if there are things that you would suggest that I change about the course or if there are some additions to the course,

26
00:02:39,930 --> 00:02:47,220
I'd love to hear those because I do. I am going to be making a case for why this should be a consistent offering in each bag.

27
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:54,479
It doesn't have to be the case if folks are like, Yeah, you know what? This this was nice, but let me just focus your efforts somewhere else.

28
00:02:54,480 --> 00:03:00,250
It'd be good to know that. So then we're providing something that's going to be valuable for the cohorts that will follow you.

29
00:03:00,390 --> 00:03:03,870
So if you have a few minutes and you can do that, that'd be great.

30
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:08,729
And even if you don't complete the canvas one or whatever it is, you can always send me a note.

31
00:03:08,730 --> 00:03:12,220
I won't be offended if it's whatever.

32
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:16,170
So does this seem like a reasonable way to spend our last time together?

33
00:03:17,310 --> 00:03:20,940
Awesome. Well, everybody so quiet. Everyone, it all looks so dour.

34
00:03:21,450 --> 00:03:25,259
It's good. It's a good day. I mean, you're done. You're next Thursday.

35
00:03:25,260 --> 00:03:29,280
This time, it'll be sitting on your couch. You can be you know, you can be.

36
00:03:30,700 --> 00:03:33,930
I don't know what people do these days and go up like in the RV again.

37
00:03:34,920 --> 00:03:40,680
I mean, people go to malls anymore. I went to a mall this year.

38
00:03:40,710 --> 00:03:44,670
It this year. That is right. Yeah.

39
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:54,220
So let's let's go ahead. Why are we here though?

40
00:03:54,230 --> 00:04:02,380
The big one here is trying to move away from this idea that injuries are just something that we have to live with.

41
00:04:02,470 --> 00:04:06,330
They're inevitable. So three words.

42
00:04:06,870 --> 00:04:14,160
Tell me tell me what you see on the slide. And if these prompts aren't going to work, I'll try to use it to narrow or rephrase.

43
00:04:14,430 --> 00:04:19,380
But these are the three words that I think when I'm thinking about reframing that we need to consider.

44
00:04:19,650 --> 00:04:23,340
Why do you think I might have chosen these three words in the context of injury prevention?

45
00:04:29,940 --> 00:04:43,100
And you can pick them out of order if you'd like. Don't you dare do this to me, boss.

46
00:04:43,990 --> 00:04:47,020
I've got 3 hours to kill you, Rachel.

47
00:04:47,960 --> 00:04:52,670
Just going to say how you like it. Kind of teed up the question.

48
00:04:52,780 --> 00:04:57,069
These things like our meddling, they don't have to happen.

49
00:04:57,070 --> 00:05:04,630
And injuries are all of the above. So injuries are all of the above as the injuries are preventable.

50
00:05:05,290 --> 00:05:09,460
Okay. All right. Predictable. Yes, they can.

51
00:05:09,550 --> 00:05:14,020
Like a fall or substance use, sir.

52
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:17,710
What else do we cover? Our arms? If you feel like they're preventable.

53
00:05:18,820 --> 00:05:25,630
Yeah. Okay. And you feel like they're predictable. Yeah, I agree.

54
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:34,920
I think also like three words, help me think about injuries in the systemic framework too, as opposed to just the individual.

55
00:05:35,410 --> 00:05:45,930
I think that's a really important shift for me because I think in all of these I can see how the system is setting people up to experience injuries.

56
00:05:46,050 --> 00:05:50,920
Mm. To just think, oh someone tumble down the stairs.

57
00:05:51,070 --> 00:05:55,230
Right. Really. Like basically no injury.

58
00:05:55,240 --> 00:05:58,260
But how all.

59
00:05:58,390 --> 00:06:07,450
And also is thinking like on the I don't know falling down the stairs is tragic but like in the violence area that area too,

60
00:06:07,450 --> 00:06:08,919
I think that's particularly meaningful.

61
00:06:08,920 --> 00:06:17,110
I think that's what I spend my time thinking about in terms of injury prevention is just how much the system is set

62
00:06:17,110 --> 00:06:28,569
up and also with the with the susceptible part harm specific communities and people more so than other communities.

63
00:06:28,570 --> 00:06:35,469
And so, um, I think these really start that shift away from like what are how we target

64
00:06:35,470 --> 00:06:40,060
individuals about whether or not they're experiencing injuries and how are we talking

65
00:06:40,060 --> 00:06:44,950
to systems and policy makers and also including individuals in that discussion

66
00:06:44,950 --> 00:06:51,069
because there are risk behaviors that we can address while trying to fix systems.

67
00:06:51,070 --> 00:06:59,620
But I think it makes a larger conversation that maybe what it would be if things as accidental or unpredictable.

68
00:07:00,100 --> 00:07:03,160
Yeah. Okay. A few different things to unpack in the answer.

69
00:07:03,430 --> 00:07:08,020
Yeah, I like I like what you said because, like, public health isn't like a fixed thing.

70
00:07:08,410 --> 00:07:11,160
It's dynamic and malleable. It is depending on what we do.

71
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:19,600
And I think, like I was like, the best thing about it to me is like anything and anyone is at risk of any injury occurring.

72
00:07:20,170 --> 00:07:23,740
And so because of that, it's like, well, not every injury has to happen.

73
00:07:24,100 --> 00:07:25,569
We can do our best, but we can't.

74
00:07:25,570 --> 00:07:33,910
Like because I think like with our discussion, like last week we were to prevent everything by God that would be a miracle.

75
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:39,520
But I think we're like just making progress instead of like, well, this is the way it's bad, this is how it's working.

76
00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:44,590
That's that like I think, like there is a possibility that part of.

77
00:07:53,920 --> 00:07:57,970
No other thoughts or comments. Not right or wrong answers here.

78
00:08:01,620 --> 00:08:09,940
I think to build on that, um, injury prevention is almost like a tool you can use in public health to reframe.

79
00:08:10,340 --> 00:08:18,130
Like you said, it's hard for me to think of, like, topics in public health that wouldn't fit in injury prevention.

80
00:08:19,330 --> 00:08:25,900
All right. Because it's just it's almost like a smarter way of it's a more proactive rather than reactive way of public health issues.

81
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:38,980
So I think it's totally you know, it's a super powerful and important topic area that I think should be part of the curriculum for sure.

82
00:08:39,060 --> 00:08:48,750
Yeah, it excites me. Like I when I think of all my classes, this is like the one that feels the most modern, right?

83
00:08:50,380 --> 00:08:52,090
So. Okay.

84
00:08:52,270 --> 00:08:57,730
Well know, that's that's great to hear, especially with somebody, because I don't think this was necessarily the language folks would have used.

85
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:06,579
You know, you might you might have heard kind of a shift away from things like victim blaming and when it comes to assaults or sexual assault and,

86
00:09:06,580 --> 00:09:13,569
you know, the last ten, 15 years, but you probably didn't hear so much of that around from other forms of unintentional injury.

87
00:09:13,570 --> 00:09:17,979
Right. It's most often because someone something happened to them or they did something that

88
00:09:17,980 --> 00:09:21,040
might have made them perhaps more susceptible to Avery's point that there might be

89
00:09:21,280 --> 00:09:27,009
contextual factors that we need to consider to think about what are some of the what are

90
00:09:27,010 --> 00:09:32,510
some of the covariant conditions that might make someone more susceptible for an injury?

91
00:09:32,530 --> 00:09:41,860
Can we use what we know about other aspects of public health to help our predictability and then ultimately prevention?

92
00:09:42,410 --> 00:09:48,310
And I think all of those kind of play and I'd be curious if anybody else has another worry that they might substitute in here.

93
00:09:48,550 --> 00:09:59,380
These are my three. If you're trying to talk about, you know, to people outside of this class about injuries, if you might use a different word.

94
00:10:00,670 --> 00:10:11,420
Um. I might use, like, forward thinking instead of predictable.

95
00:10:11,660 --> 00:10:15,590
I've got some. What? I don't know yet.

96
00:10:18,970 --> 00:10:24,220
Not for the better. Yeah, I think so.

97
00:10:24,370 --> 00:10:34,360
In the undergrad program, there's a lot of focus on the building, but the building blocks of what seems to encapsulate a lot of injury prevention.

98
00:10:34,690 --> 00:10:43,419
And I would love to see more of that incorporated into the undergrad curriculum, because obviously everything is so interconnected.

99
00:10:43,420 --> 00:10:55,450
But when we're thinking about so many prevention based community interventions that why would we think

100
00:10:55,450 --> 00:11:03,070
of why would we be given assignments for those kinds of things without any sort of injury prevention?

101
00:11:04,450 --> 00:11:18,159
FAFSA. I think I would maybe like I don't know include sustainable in that a lot of these things once they like once

102
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:27,160
you get the ball rolling these are things that will sustain the health of future generations and viable,

103
00:11:27,160 --> 00:11:31,720
sustainable. I think that one, it's a bit beyond my field.

104
00:11:32,920 --> 00:11:36,969
In our training, you expect people to just be done. We've done our due diligence.

105
00:11:36,970 --> 00:11:38,910
We're out of here. But none of.

106
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:49,660
Well, keep in mind, as we're moving through or if one pops up, you're like, hey, this should have been on slide number one.

107
00:11:51,190 --> 00:11:56,840
So just let's kind of recap some of these things, folks feeling comfortable now.

108
00:11:56,860 --> 00:12:00,160
Could you describe differences between intentional and unintentional injury?

109
00:12:00,520 --> 00:12:03,669
Is there is there is it important that we continue to make this delineation?

110
00:12:03,670 --> 00:12:05,860
This class used to be to it was unintentional injury.

111
00:12:06,040 --> 00:12:15,480
It was I think was mostly they kind of once actually I think one of our research faculty's teaching a class next semester on violence prevention may

112
00:12:15,490 --> 00:12:23,950
consider checking out a little investment as an educational psychologist bias right there it's stuff but she does a lot of this kind of work too.

113
00:12:23,950 --> 00:12:28,900
But anyways. Yeah, yeah. What's the difference between intentional unintentional?

114
00:12:29,140 --> 00:12:34,960
Oh, what's the difference? Because I like framing wise because I hear the word.

115
00:12:35,080 --> 00:12:39,370
It's kind of like I'm thinking about how we discussed like suicide or mental health.

116
00:12:39,910 --> 00:12:48,910
It's like, Oh, if you say you commit suicide, that sounds not good with like all the linguistics and like and like,

117
00:12:49,330 --> 00:12:55,000
cause it's like, well, did you have the intent to kill? Did you have the intent to do this to yourself?

118
00:12:55,540 --> 00:13:01,750
And that to me, I would just that how much does that matter when you're talking to somebody about an injury?

119
00:13:02,200 --> 00:13:09,480
If you're like, oh, this was an intentional injury, that might be. I'm wondering how that person would feel in that regard.

120
00:13:09,590 --> 00:13:15,490
Like this is an injury that occurred. Let's talk about what happened like that discussion.

121
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:18,520
So have you go over what the difference is?

122
00:13:18,520 --> 00:13:28,750
Because like to me, it seems like I know there's a difference, but is that difference enough to like have it be repeated in literature?

123
00:13:31,890 --> 00:13:35,219
I'm sorry. No, no, it's okay. It's it's an interesting question.

124
00:13:35,220 --> 00:13:39,120
And, I mean, I think we we don't like to use the term, you know, accidents or whatever.

125
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:42,689
But I mean, essentially that's yeah. I mean, is there is there a motivation?

126
00:13:42,690 --> 00:13:44,940
Is there an intent?

127
00:13:44,940 --> 00:13:54,150
I mean, to be circular in the definition versus something that was unintended were was it was not directed by an action or whatever.

128
00:13:54,270 --> 00:14:00,770
Yeah. And to your point, I mean, the thing when that kind of bubbled up there is is the distinction really that important?

129
00:14:00,780 --> 00:14:04,109
If at the end of the day, we're talking about kind of overall injury burden?

130
00:14:04,110 --> 00:14:08,969
And you think about it, I mean, the CDC will pass these two things out for us and they will try to they will go to

131
00:14:08,970 --> 00:14:13,530
great lengths to categorize what injuries are intentional versus unintentional.

132
00:14:15,300 --> 00:14:19,730
And as evaluator. Yeah. Are they going from the sexual violence?

133
00:14:19,740 --> 00:14:25,170
Things are not very valuable because sexual violence is about imposing your power on another person.

134
00:14:25,170 --> 00:14:34,659
And that's intentional. And I would I think I'd be really frustrated if I was in like a sexual violence prevention space and people

135
00:14:34,660 --> 00:14:42,090
weren't talking about it as an intentional act created by one or more people against another one or more people.

136
00:14:43,320 --> 00:14:50,040
I think also are to me, there is a pretty big difference between like someone accidentally firing a

137
00:14:50,040 --> 00:14:55,920
firearm and intentionally firing a firearm at themselves or another person.

138
00:14:56,480 --> 00:15:03,299
I think that there are a lot of complicating factors about suicide that have to be addressed in that intention conversation.

139
00:15:03,300 --> 00:15:13,110
But I still think that there is a difference between like, Oh, I dropped a firearm and it wasn't locked and unloaded and you're like,

140
00:15:13,410 --> 00:15:20,190
I have bullets in it and shot someone versus I aimed at someone or myself.

141
00:15:20,430 --> 00:15:30,630
And I just think that to me that just I mean, it is like something like that sexual violence like that that I find personally.

142
00:15:33,690 --> 00:15:44,670
Yeah. You know I'm understanding and current year reflecting on kind of a little bit of an individual.

143
00:15:45,540 --> 00:15:49,799
Are you kind of in that home? Yeah, it's just. Yeah, I'm thinking, like Simon.

144
00:15:49,800 --> 00:15:51,780
Yeah. So I think that.

145
00:15:52,470 --> 00:15:58,410
I think that it's important to identify, but I think that people really want to identify whether it's potentially unintentional.

146
00:15:59,220 --> 00:16:02,410
We to figure out why that went into it or how that went into it.

147
00:16:02,410 --> 00:16:09,950
And I think that's really important. Hi.

148
00:16:11,160 --> 00:16:20,460
Why is this happening? I just heard. Well, that depends on what we're talking about, because we're talking about sexual violence.

149
00:16:20,640 --> 00:16:25,400
Yeah. You know that, right?

150
00:16:26,190 --> 00:16:33,610
Right. Yeah. Yeah, like totally related to that.

151
00:16:33,610 --> 00:16:37,659
It's like I feel like kind of simmering underneath the surface of injury.

152
00:16:37,660 --> 00:16:43,600
Prevention is like mental health. Mm hmm. And, like, how it affects, like, half of these injuries, basically.

153
00:16:43,990 --> 00:16:54,760
Well, maybe I'll. I don't know. Um, which is totally built in to be an unintentional versus intentional, you know, framework, I think.

154
00:17:01,950 --> 00:17:07,440
Yeah, sir. I'm just going to backtrack to the last conversation kind of.

155
00:17:08,040 --> 00:17:12,540
And I feel like part of it is inherent, but I feel like it's worthwhile to still have it.

156
00:17:12,750 --> 00:17:16,860
Just spread it out, like interdisciplinary and tried and true.

157
00:17:16,890 --> 00:17:22,380
But I think, yeah, you know, mental health is a part of this inherently.

158
00:17:22,680 --> 00:17:27,670
I mean, from the speakers we've had, for example talking about how to the policy.

159
00:17:28,810 --> 00:17:32,049
Individuals from a more marginal background or even the concept of storytelling,

160
00:17:32,050 --> 00:17:37,810
which is something we're not trained to do as academics, but then other communities are.

161
00:17:37,820 --> 00:17:43,750
And this again, as we're inherently all of our discussions we've had in this class about injury,

162
00:17:43,750 --> 00:17:47,950
have at one point in time or another brought in some other field, some other theories.

163
00:17:47,950 --> 00:17:52,000
Another idea that we're not certainly trained in. Yeah, for sure.

164
00:17:52,360 --> 00:17:53,530
There going to need injury conferences.

165
00:17:53,530 --> 00:18:02,200
You see more doctors than you do at a hospital and you get psychiatrists, psychologists and engineers can come into play.

166
00:18:02,980 --> 00:18:07,150
Anthropologists, social workers, educators, public policy folks.

167
00:18:07,150 --> 00:18:11,979
Yeah, I mean, it's absolutely a and I think we even have a slight layer.

168
00:18:11,980 --> 00:18:15,730
I mean, absolutely something that's going to require more than just public health, folks.

169
00:18:15,730 --> 00:18:24,969
I think public health is a great nexus because we are already trained to think interdisciplinary right in front of our I think our real skill is

170
00:18:24,970 --> 00:18:32,080
to connect people and to see the big picture while recognizing the individual constituencies and playing a little bit of that puppeteer role.

171
00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:38,440
So I like that interdisciplinary. Okay. Okay. How about this one development across the lifespan when I put that there?

172
00:18:40,210 --> 00:18:46,440
Speaking of intent. Because injuries affect people at disproportionate rates.

173
00:18:47,550 --> 00:18:53,040
Yeah. Yeah. I mean, you look at those CDC graphs and there there's trends, right?

174
00:18:53,130 --> 00:18:58,650
You're seeing where people are most at risk for suicide, for motor vehicle crashes.

175
00:18:58,650 --> 00:19:03,030
Remember that you curve. You can see where people are most at risk for firearm deaths.

176
00:19:03,030 --> 00:19:09,209
And when you start to break out where different subpopulations how those kind of raise or lower

177
00:19:09,210 --> 00:19:13,140
their their prevalence and risk which means that our interventions are going to be tailored.

178
00:19:13,170 --> 00:19:18,090
Right. It's been a theme throughout the course is that we can't just assume there's going to be a one size fits all.

179
00:19:18,300 --> 00:19:24,600
And I think development is one place to start. Where are what population are we really talking about?

180
00:19:24,600 --> 00:19:27,780
Where are they from? Kind of a life course perspective.

181
00:19:28,590 --> 00:19:34,260
Among other features that are all going to kind of weigh in here. But that's absolutely something to consider.

182
00:19:35,100 --> 00:19:38,830
Avery kind of hinted at this one. And this is this is public health, right?

183
00:19:38,850 --> 00:19:42,260
We're thinking we are thinking multilevel. Right.

184
00:19:42,270 --> 00:19:56,610
And can anyone pull up an injury example that would not be across all four or more of these models of the socio sociocultural challenge.

185
00:19:56,610 --> 00:20:05,690
Do please do everyone out there. No, not what happens, but maybe who knows?

186
00:20:05,870 --> 00:20:11,510
And then it kind of disparities piece again. Also, Arlen, you know, I don't like that phrase.

187
00:20:12,800 --> 00:20:16,520
It is something that we are we need to tend to. Also,

188
00:20:16,520 --> 00:20:21,590
very unlikely to find an injury space where you're not seeing some disparities or

189
00:20:22,100 --> 00:20:26,510
inequitable burden across either populations or development or wherever else it could be.

190
00:20:27,410 --> 00:20:33,110
So all of these things are challenges to the way that we're going to approach the solution to the problem.

191
00:20:33,380 --> 00:20:40,040
If we think that these are all true, that we can identify susceptibility, that we can predict injury and therefore prevent injury.

192
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:46,489
You're going to be dealing with this kind of stuff. How are we how are we designing our interventions?

193
00:20:46,490 --> 00:20:48,440
If a mental health is touching all these bases,

194
00:20:48,590 --> 00:20:53,360
does it make sense to think about a distracted driving intervention that doesn't incorporate a mental health component?

195
00:20:53,540 --> 00:21:01,790
I don't know. Right. Those are there's going to be all a myriad questions that haven't been answered even in the most saturated spaces.

196
00:21:02,150 --> 00:21:07,130
So even places where you can find umpteen bajillion articles and this is all from a research context,

197
00:21:07,670 --> 00:21:13,070
there's still going to be issues and they're still going to be places where, well, I really couldn't find these.

198
00:21:13,140 --> 00:21:16,879
This is one of those classes where you can kind of say there's not a lot of research on this topic,

199
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:20,780
but it's kind of short, which is both an opportunity and a challenge.

200
00:21:22,040 --> 00:21:27,680
What would you describe this? Somebody walking by in the hallway mean how much you think about this slide?

201
00:21:33,950 --> 00:21:45,200
Yeah. I think I like the idea of thinking about tertiary intervention versus primary prevention or tertiary prevention,

202
00:21:45,950 --> 00:21:49,340
tertiary interventions versus primary prevention.

203
00:21:49,640 --> 00:21:57,230
And I forget the difference with it as anything, but like, I mean, fatalities like that,

204
00:21:57,260 --> 00:22:05,060
it's the idea of like you're putting this the idea of like putting a bandaid on something

205
00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:09,800
instead of making sure that someone doesn't cut themselves and then needs a Band-Aid,

206
00:22:11,900 --> 00:22:26,000
that that it's most sustainable and economical to think about, you know,

207
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:30,470
what's underneath the surface of the water rather than the tip of the iceberg.

208
00:22:30,800 --> 00:22:41,150
Yeah. That arguably, resources should be allocated towards the bottom of the pyramid rather than the top of the pyramid.

209
00:22:41,390 --> 00:22:45,080
Public health is most effective when people can't see it.

210
00:22:46,700 --> 00:22:55,010
Okay? Or like public health, you know that public health is doing its job when you're not fully aware of.

211
00:22:55,100 --> 00:23:00,590
It's like what it's doing at that time in place.

212
00:23:01,700 --> 00:23:07,840
Um, all right, so I'm, I just some, a little language to kind of scramble that because, I mean,

213
00:23:08,450 --> 00:23:17,450
I'm hearing a little bit more kind of like a universal selected indicated sort of approach where you have broad

214
00:23:17,450 --> 00:23:23,990
based interventions or broad based interactions versus those that are higher or higher and higher levels of risk.

215
00:23:24,350 --> 00:23:30,110
I can see that the way to interpret this well. So it's another way that folks could look at this or is this kind of.

216
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:43,600
Yeah. I think I kind of want to flip them on what you know, because they're reminding me of the upstream.

217
00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:44,740
Downstream. Right.

218
00:23:44,900 --> 00:23:54,520
Thinking of it as way like, you know, how use like and how in upstream liquids, you stop the person from, like, throwing themselves in the stream.

219
00:23:54,830 --> 00:24:03,240
Mm hmm. Well, I mean, now they're again, instead of just like, you know, people, like, pulling them up from the state and down from the outside.

220
00:24:03,490 --> 00:24:09,530
Okay. So I'm thinking, like, instead of we stop the person who's, like, pushing people up from the mountain.

221
00:24:10,290 --> 00:24:15,950
So that's right. Pushing people over the top there.

222
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:19,490
So you'd like flip the words, you know, people at the top of the mountain medically and.

223
00:24:19,810 --> 00:24:24,550
All right. So that that's that's more kind of primary versus secondary tertiary intervention.

224
00:24:24,840 --> 00:24:29,470
And I had mentioned something like that, too. There are these as the outcomes of injury.

225
00:24:29,830 --> 00:24:33,270
They could be. Yeah, that's that's one reason. Like that's how I'm reading.

226
00:24:33,520 --> 00:24:36,760
All right. Well, these are outcomes of injury. And then you tell me, what does this mountain supposed to say?

227
00:24:36,970 --> 00:24:41,740
What it is, I guess it's looking at it from a business standpoint.

228
00:24:43,370 --> 00:24:55,260
We already have. I wouldn't say great data to support fatalities and hospitalizations and indeed visits that all of those things are recorded,

229
00:24:55,470 --> 00:25:01,320
recorded when the incident occurs. But there's still a lot to be done as far as what we don't know.

230
00:25:01,470 --> 00:25:02,280
That's not recorded.

231
00:25:03,120 --> 00:25:12,670
And that's actually the purpose there, that the way that I present this slide is we actually do have pretty decent data here, right?

232
00:25:12,690 --> 00:25:14,700
You got national data. You got local data.

233
00:25:14,700 --> 00:25:19,799
We know by and large, when this happens, it's very rare that we don't don't have some form of documentation,

234
00:25:19,800 --> 00:25:24,300
even if it is, you know, uncategorized, little bit less so.

235
00:25:24,300 --> 00:25:27,900
But this happens more. There are more hospitalizations than there are fatalities.

236
00:25:28,230 --> 00:25:32,190
There are even more ID visits than there are full hospitalizations.

237
00:25:32,190 --> 00:25:37,229
People get triaged and they don't go right. There are a lot more outpatient visits.

238
00:25:37,230 --> 00:25:40,410
You never make it to the end. It's an injury, but it's not so severe that you need to go it.

239
00:25:40,890 --> 00:25:44,219
And then there's all of these different sorts of injuries, right?

240
00:25:44,220 --> 00:25:50,940
So it's recognizing that our injury burden is probably a lot, a lot a lot higher than what we see in the data.

241
00:25:51,390 --> 00:26:02,010
Right. And that's a big deal. Right. So just because you can't find and I had this conversation with some folks at a kind of a firearms conference,

242
00:26:02,220 --> 00:26:08,280
you know, it's there are a number of shootings that might not make it to here.

243
00:26:08,580 --> 00:26:11,819
Right. Believe it or not, I think it's a pretty severe form of violence.

244
00:26:11,820 --> 00:26:18,540
And more often than not, it's going to be manifesting. But you can think of all the other forms of injury that never make it to our eyes.

245
00:26:18,810 --> 00:26:21,959
And so how do we incorporate those? How do we predict those?

246
00:26:21,960 --> 00:26:29,300
How do we intervene with those? Yeah, a lot of those things double coming to you that you need.

247
00:26:29,520 --> 00:26:36,150
I did not make it all right. If you go to an event and then you expire in 80 or something.

248
00:26:36,300 --> 00:26:44,100
Yeah. Like or they can't really I think it still would be counted.

249
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:51,630
And you use this, this would never be equal. Right. So why does it could be if never make it.

250
00:26:53,190 --> 00:26:58,840
I don't know exactly how they would count it. I think they're breaking up all that they could be in any visit and the them.

251
00:27:02,390 --> 00:27:06,520
So when it comes to, I guess. 14.

252
00:27:08,930 --> 00:27:12,980
I'm talking about how these things appear. Are you going to say to.

253
00:27:14,750 --> 00:27:16,980
Suppose it's more of your outcome, right?

254
00:27:18,210 --> 00:27:27,920
Um, if you had two types of injuries that are less likely to result in fatality would make more sense to to focus on probably visits.

255
00:27:28,400 --> 00:27:32,670
Um. Yeah.

256
00:27:32,790 --> 00:27:36,310
I'm not sure there would be other mirror actually around. Yeah.

257
00:27:36,450 --> 00:27:43,259
This isn't a commentary on this is like a severity of outcome in terms like what we actually pay attention to is obviously in every scenario,

258
00:27:43,260 --> 00:27:48,840
the worst outcome is someone dies. That's like fatality there. You can't they either die or they don't.

259
00:27:49,740 --> 00:27:53,690
So that's like that's like kind of like the top of the iceberg that we have to pay attention to.

260
00:27:53,690 --> 00:27:55,580
But obviously we want to avoid that worse.

261
00:27:55,590 --> 00:28:03,590
I think the worst outcome because fatality is going to be worse than hospitalization pass is worse than just 80% better than that.

262
00:28:03,720 --> 00:28:08,790
So not that they're not equally important, but in the order of what we have to pay attention to.

263
00:28:08,970 --> 00:28:14,620
Right. The other one that don't have any that we could potentially squeeze in would be just the, uh,

264
00:28:15,150 --> 00:28:20,550
the recovery process here, the like the sustained injury, chronic injuries that might follow.

265
00:28:21,540 --> 00:28:24,750
I don't know if you showed something like this, but do we have something that shows like.

266
00:28:25,710 --> 00:28:29,820
Like where people die? Uh, I don't.

267
00:28:29,850 --> 00:28:33,150
I do that, though, and this, that that's a problem for some of those data.

268
00:28:33,750 --> 00:28:41,160
So if someone a lot of people die where a lot of people die in the same hospitals.

269
00:28:41,340 --> 00:28:48,209
Yeah. So if we look at location of death, um, you're going to get inflation because people are transferred.

270
00:28:48,210 --> 00:28:57,090
Maybe this is, I mean, to your point or, or they weren't under care and then they die, but the injury might have occurred elsewhere.

271
00:28:57,090 --> 00:29:03,570
So we try to incorporate things like EMT data and other ways to try to figure out where an injury might have happened.

272
00:29:04,680 --> 00:29:08,100
But it's incomplete for sure. Yeah. You like the whole picture? Yeah.

273
00:29:09,150 --> 00:29:15,780
I just want to throw in a slightly different interpretation of what you said about the Italians necessarily be worse off.

274
00:29:16,980 --> 00:29:20,610
I mean, obviously, you know, want to mitigate as much as humanly possible.

275
00:29:20,610 --> 00:29:26,250
But I also don't want to me of this or two more things the cumulative impacts injury can have on you,

276
00:29:26,670 --> 00:29:32,060
particularly on access to health statistics, on fisheries.

277
00:29:32,290 --> 00:29:45,600
Okay, that's great. I'm wondering about if there's like a different like image or like symbolic to use, because I do appreciate the icebergs.

278
00:29:46,360 --> 00:29:51,510
I've seen an iceberg in many classes multiple times. Oh, and yeah.

279
00:29:51,840 --> 00:29:58,800
And so my thing is, is like, yeah, we all see like but like you can see a lighthouse and it's like, oh yeah,

280
00:29:58,950 --> 00:30:05,100
like the lighthouse was originally like use like it was for ships to it becomes so they can get out of the bad waters.

281
00:30:05,450 --> 00:30:05,680
Well, like,

282
00:30:05,700 --> 00:30:16,219
I'm wondering if there's other examples out there for us to be like looking at in this field because I like I do understand like death is really,

283
00:30:16,220 --> 00:30:27,600
really bad who don't want it. But I also feel like since so many things get this like is it is like the continued like well there's a

284
00:30:27,600 --> 00:30:33,090
point there's a continued point of here's the number of people who have died because things are bad.

285
00:30:34,410 --> 00:30:41,129
Is there another example that you could use to like show like there's a bunch of things that we're missing you don't like.

286
00:30:41,130 --> 00:30:45,720
There is this. It's important, but there's other things, the solar system.

287
00:30:46,560 --> 00:30:51,450
So this is sort of what's at the center at the moment.

288
00:30:51,450 --> 00:30:59,430
You just have to build when you want to draw them, the child finds a gun and a gun still goes off.

289
00:30:59,580 --> 00:31:02,650
How does the classified and controlled control and.

290
00:31:07,250 --> 00:31:14,740
Even if a child finds a gun and they're playing bang, bang or something like that, that's still usually considered an intentional.

291
00:31:21,090 --> 00:31:25,650
Well, I'll tell you what. If somebody can come up with an analogy, I mean, go for it.

292
00:31:26,700 --> 00:31:31,980
So much of what we're trying to do, because for the average person walking by in the hallway, you're like that person right there.

293
00:31:32,250 --> 00:31:35,360
This is probably is probably not a conversation that they've had.

294
00:31:35,730 --> 00:31:37,920
They've probably not really thought about. Well, wait a minute.

295
00:31:37,920 --> 00:31:47,520
When the CDC publishes data on the number of concussion related fatalities in the past year, that there are probably hundreds,

296
00:31:47,520 --> 00:31:54,420
if not thousands of concussions that were treated in the head or at your doctor's office or went undiagnosed at all.

297
00:31:55,260 --> 00:31:59,970
And so what is it that you're trying to communicate? How might you try to share some of this information?

298
00:32:00,210 --> 00:32:03,710
Are there better analogies than the iceberg?

299
00:32:03,780 --> 00:32:08,249
Probably. I would love for anyone one if you have one of those moments.

300
00:32:08,250 --> 00:32:12,510
And so, you know, you can lay down like, oh, all right.

301
00:32:14,220 --> 00:32:19,970
Let's see here. After tsunamis, if the challenge is multi-faceted, that means the solution can be too.

302
00:32:20,260 --> 00:32:25,079
I don't think we need to go into all that depth here, but it is both.

303
00:32:25,080 --> 00:32:30,960
And you can also hypothesize what I would show the slide again.

304
00:32:35,290 --> 00:32:39,270
Is it stating the obvious? Yeah.

305
00:32:40,450 --> 00:32:45,590
Right. I mean, again, that's I think public health folks are used to thinking about big, complex problems.

306
00:32:46,370 --> 00:32:52,790
If anything, I would think that this class is showing you that even straightforward sort of forms of injury.

307
00:32:53,090 --> 00:33:00,960
When you really start to think about them, there's a lot more complexity in unison than we realize, and which that plays to some of those challenges.

308
00:33:01,120 --> 00:33:05,810
We decide to go to the.

309
00:33:14,770 --> 00:33:22,839
Any thoughts on challenges related to or opportunities related to injury related intervention relative

310
00:33:22,840 --> 00:33:28,060
to the other forms of intervention folks are interested in pursuing or have talked about the crisis.

311
00:33:29,910 --> 00:33:36,270
Just out of curiosity, is his injury distinct in some ways, or can you take those public health models?

312
00:33:38,710 --> 00:33:44,110
And apply them pretty readily here to develop. You mentioned how many folks are taking care of the 86, 51.

313
00:33:50,890 --> 00:34:00,420
We've all taken section 204. So you know what it is program and show them what they can program these elements.

314
00:34:01,960 --> 00:34:05,720
All right. I got to be more handsome or at least have an idea. So tell me then.

315
00:34:05,740 --> 00:34:11,490
I mean, is is injury any different than how you might approach other forms of intervention?

316
00:34:11,620 --> 00:34:25,240
All. I would say the one difference is when it comes to actually putting in place, like obviously you can't see intervention.

317
00:34:26,110 --> 00:34:27,440
It's not practical.

318
00:34:28,250 --> 00:34:36,080
And someone to go to harm or be harmed as he continued to work versus I think when we do community engagement as far as nutrition wise.

319
00:34:36,560 --> 00:34:41,220
We can obviously see that and actually. Encourage that behavior.

320
00:34:41,310 --> 00:34:45,790
Raj is like this. It's unethical, actually, to collect.

321
00:34:47,040 --> 00:34:54,390
Right. Okay. So there are some challenges from a design aspect because we can't randomize people into an experience injury category.

322
00:35:00,790 --> 00:35:04,180
You need to be somewhere along the lines of like chronic disease prevention because like,

323
00:35:04,210 --> 00:35:08,710
you can't really necessarily measure the amount of people who didn't get a chronic disease.

324
00:35:08,770 --> 00:35:14,510
Mm hmm. Those that did. So, like, building up those preventative measures is sort of like.

325
00:35:23,340 --> 00:35:27,000
It works in that you see the changes within the amount of.

326
00:35:29,490 --> 00:35:33,010
So. Andrew Right.

327
00:35:34,060 --> 00:35:42,160
I'll say another similarity. There is the time scale which which you can expect to see change for injury based, particularly anything policy related,

328
00:35:42,160 --> 00:35:45,790
which is oftentimes where we are speaking to think about interventions and injury.

329
00:35:46,870 --> 00:35:52,810
You might not see some of these changes manifest in four years. And then I think your measurement challenge is a really important one.

330
00:35:53,260 --> 00:35:56,110
How do you assess an injury that didn't occur?

331
00:35:56,230 --> 00:36:04,000
Something that didn't happen is incredibly challenging, and that also speaks to some of the rarity of some forms of injury.

332
00:36:04,720 --> 00:36:08,500
And unfortunately, injuries do happen in some way at higher levels of frequency.

333
00:36:08,500 --> 00:36:19,330
But there's also a number of them drownings we just mentioned the child unsupervised access, very, very rare happens quite rare.

334
00:36:19,960 --> 00:36:28,140
There are other forms to fire. So that's something which don't happen often and therefore make it more difficult to predict or systematize actions.

335
00:36:28,150 --> 00:36:32,290
That I think is something that sends up to know that you're going to be this is quite a change.

336
00:36:34,010 --> 00:36:41,840
But the topics that we've discussed, I think, are more aggressive times or political undermining.

337
00:36:42,090 --> 00:36:45,300
Mm hmm. Or maybe like, for example, cancer.

338
00:36:48,270 --> 00:36:53,180
And he does that. Our conversation about.

339
00:36:56,010 --> 00:37:02,550
I think runs into more pushback in some of the other spaces that we might find ourselves in.

340
00:37:02,860 --> 00:37:10,799
Sure. Yeah. I mean, if money talks, then there's certainly some I mean, you can see clear attention and progress to some areas of injury,

341
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:16,140
whereas others struggle to find support for either intervention, development or research.

342
00:37:16,590 --> 00:37:24,510
Yeah. Yeah. So I was one. I haven't taken sex with you on program development, but I was wondering.

343
00:37:24,660 --> 00:37:33,360
So again, my our project, we found like a lot of statistics on children driving an overheated cars because it's hot.

344
00:37:33,810 --> 00:37:39,090
And I was wondering like how like the intervention for that, how would you intervene with that?

345
00:37:39,090 --> 00:37:46,260
How would you interview with how parents or caregivers or just adults responsible for chil for children?

346
00:37:46,260 --> 00:37:53,340
How do you how does that work? How do you interfere and kind of tell somebody what to be doing with the child?

347
00:37:53,400 --> 00:37:59,549
Sure. I'd love to hear folks responding. Yeah. And my car tells me, check your battery.

348
00:37:59,550 --> 00:38:03,030
Yeah, I'm ready to have it like alerts and beeps.

349
00:38:03,030 --> 00:38:12,120
It might sound that's like a new thing, cause it's it's a beautiful kind of a coming together of multiple things as an engineering thing, right?

350
00:38:12,120 --> 00:38:16,319
I educational squash and every bit of programing into a car. Absolutely not.

351
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:19,350
But there you go. All right. What else? That's one way.

352
00:38:19,350 --> 00:38:27,420
So car says, hey, if you'll take a backseat, is there not a dog to ride, only to die in a super hot car?

353
00:38:33,850 --> 00:38:40,300
I feel like this is on the same line as the conversation we had last week when we asking your neighbor, there's the fire.

354
00:38:40,770 --> 00:38:45,680
And I think it's just it's just conversation we have to have. They're comfortable that they need to be had.

355
00:38:45,800 --> 00:38:51,170
But I think we just have to communicate in a way that's.

356
00:38:52,150 --> 00:38:56,080
Now, that doesn't sound judgy based off of your parenting styles,

357
00:38:56,080 --> 00:39:04,460
but more so just like there's real implications that are bad implications that could come out of this if it's if we don't talk about.

358
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:12,790
To normalizing certain conversations or places to intervene.

359
00:39:12,790 --> 00:39:18,009
So we think about the kind of bystander interventions and when you should say, Hey, I think you don't have to drink,

360
00:39:18,010 --> 00:39:22,120
let me drive, or, Hey, I don't think you should stay at this party you've been reading or whatever.

361
00:39:23,440 --> 00:39:28,600
How comfortable would you be to, you know, somebody getting out of their car and they had your kid in the backseat?

362
00:39:29,290 --> 00:39:32,750
You know, the car may be still running, but they're going to run into the gas station to grab something.

363
00:39:32,770 --> 00:39:40,030
Would you say it's 85 degrees outside and within 2 minutes your car could easily be 110 degrees?

364
00:39:41,860 --> 00:39:44,950
Our folks are going to have this conversation. Do they know how to have those conversations?

365
00:39:46,700 --> 00:39:52,909
Yeah. I think also thinking about the factors that lead people to do what they do and

366
00:39:52,910 --> 00:39:57,979
setting up the conversations in a way that like recognizes all of those factors.

367
00:39:57,980 --> 00:40:04,219
Like if you're like a parent who by themselves with three children and you

368
00:40:04,220 --> 00:40:08,810
just want to run into paying for your gas like it sounds like a hassle to you.

369
00:40:08,960 --> 00:40:15,080
Three children all out of the car and like haul them into the gas station or your one kid finally fell asleep on the way home,

370
00:40:15,080 --> 00:40:23,629
like, you know, kind of thing. And so I think I feel like it's a space that pediatricians can have that conversation, too.

371
00:40:23,630 --> 00:40:31,760
And I think one of the things that they talk about in child health about that a lot is the shift from like to preventing SIDS,

372
00:40:31,760 --> 00:40:38,810
which is like when like you used to say like little babies on their story, but they make fun of you.

373
00:40:39,260 --> 00:40:43,100
And so like the shift of, like talking about that and like figuring out why people do that,

374
00:40:43,100 --> 00:40:47,899
like are their families going to do that or is it like a convenience thing?

375
00:40:47,900 --> 00:40:49,800
Is that the only way that your kid stops crying?

376
00:40:49,820 --> 00:40:56,389
Like like what are the all the factors and how are you incorporating those into the conversation so that you're not just being like,

377
00:40:56,390 --> 00:41:01,459
Yeah, you should leave your kid in the car. It's like a horrible thing to do and you're going to, you know, injure your child.

378
00:41:01,460 --> 00:41:05,570
But like, what role what can we set up that will help you not?

379
00:41:06,430 --> 00:41:09,440
Get in the car and then.

380
00:41:10,480 --> 00:41:14,020
It's not 100 days. Then the nursing folks.

381
00:41:14,920 --> 00:41:18,420
I remember it. And I remember. Yeah, but there.

382
00:41:18,430 --> 00:41:22,149
There there is a there is a campaign that has like this and it's like a big sign.

383
00:41:22,150 --> 00:41:25,570
It shows you how quickly you. Yeah. A 70 degree day. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

384
00:41:25,930 --> 00:41:33,520
I think there's like some practical effect as well. I've never heard of, like, daycares or a school, like, calling parents to check in.

385
00:41:33,520 --> 00:41:38,500
Like, the kid never gets dropped off because I think that's like a common time. Parents are just, like, forgetting that.

386
00:41:38,530 --> 00:41:40,540
Right. Yeah. And you go to work. So, like,

387
00:41:40,840 --> 00:41:47,710
sometimes like partnering with those like institutions and having them take some of that responsibility also works a little more structural level.

388
00:41:52,930 --> 00:41:58,120
Yes. So completely off topic. I can't stop thinking about it like you feel that last time around.

389
00:41:58,390 --> 00:42:00,400
I know. I just felt like fatality was the worst outcome.

390
00:42:02,290 --> 00:42:08,470
I was just thinking, like, because I don't want my product to be that kind of like mental health and suicide prevention.

391
00:42:10,870 --> 00:42:16,570
It's a really difficult topic also to mention in politics like assisted or physician assisted suicide.

392
00:42:18,220 --> 00:42:23,590
It's in majority of states. It's not legal. There are there's ten there's ten states that it is legal.

393
00:42:24,190 --> 00:42:27,460
Is that considered like intentional injury?

394
00:42:27,610 --> 00:42:36,069
Like for the sake of. I know that's like I think because obviously, like, the views on that situation is very complicated.

395
00:42:36,070 --> 00:42:40,140
So I don't know how that's the evidence tracks like. Yeah.

396
00:42:40,150 --> 00:42:47,020
That's that's that's beyond my parents. I will I will forward that question out to our our vice president of research.

397
00:42:47,170 --> 00:42:51,130
Rebecca Cunningham of ICD ten. Code for it is there.

398
00:42:52,040 --> 00:42:53,589
Yeah. Well, no, I believe that's true.

399
00:42:53,590 --> 00:42:58,300
I just but whether that would be considered, I mean, maybe that's a semantic thing and it doesn't really matter.

400
00:42:59,020 --> 00:43:07,510
Or maybe it does, depending again, what and maybe this is a question for you, if it's intentional versus unintentional, what does that mean for us?

401
00:43:08,020 --> 00:43:11,770
Right. Is it an injury?

402
00:43:12,310 --> 00:43:16,240
Is it an injury to be considered for medical attention?

403
00:43:17,790 --> 00:43:18,860
They're doing different things.

404
00:43:19,750 --> 00:43:27,880
I think it kind of matters like how it's coded, because I know in medical billing, a miscarriage and an abortion are under the same code.

405
00:43:27,960 --> 00:43:35,830
Yeah. So, like, I could see, like, oh, you're like, it might be illegal in your state for a physician to assistance is like,

406
00:43:36,790 --> 00:43:46,210
but I'm wondering if a physician might make decisions like, well, if we build it like this or if it's never stated that, I hope I just left this.

407
00:43:47,140 --> 00:43:51,190
I assume it seems like a horrible person that they tried to get lost.

408
00:43:51,610 --> 00:43:53,920
Yeah, like that. But that sort of thing.

409
00:43:54,080 --> 00:44:01,510
But yeah, I've done a couple reports, one at least on physician assisted suicide and like I think it is like debatable,

410
00:44:01,510 --> 00:44:08,329
but also like there's a lot of like really stringent like requirements you have to meet to be able to even like consider doing it.

411
00:44:08,330 --> 00:44:13,750
And you have to go through like so many like levels of like paperwork and consent and all of that.

412
00:44:14,050 --> 00:44:21,220
So honestly, I don't know like the like coding side of it, but I almost want to wonder if it's more of like a procedural thing,

413
00:44:21,220 --> 00:44:28,360
like a medical procedure other than like an injury just because of like you have to be like

414
00:44:28,420 --> 00:44:32,590
terminally ill blessed with six months to live to qualify for physician assisted suicide.

415
00:44:33,820 --> 00:44:38,080
Yeah. I'm not going to ask. You represent your whole profession, but. No, I just, I.

416
00:44:38,320 --> 00:44:43,780
I don't think that it's really like a billing coding thing, especially because it's like just a medication.

417
00:44:45,570 --> 00:44:51,080
And then people can take it in the comfort of their own home. Like it's something like very removed from.

418
00:44:52,170 --> 00:44:53,660
I don't know. It's like it's not like I don't know.

419
00:44:53,990 --> 00:45:04,290
It's then like sewn in TV or whatever in media is like a position like injecting, morphing into you and then like it's not really what it is at all.

420
00:45:05,250 --> 00:45:11,010
And so I think like the kind of getting into like the billing coding side of it, like I don't think that's going to be like representative.

421
00:45:13,320 --> 00:45:20,610
Well, and I don't have an answer to your question, but I will admit I'm very interested in what the answer might be from some

422
00:45:20,610 --> 00:45:25,349
of my colleagues on Guy or Doug that we've our new interest center director.

423
00:45:25,350 --> 00:45:29,160
And I want you to question to Rebecca just to see what she might say.

424
00:45:29,190 --> 00:45:33,339
She's also a E.D. doc, but then runs an injury center.

425
00:45:33,340 --> 00:45:41,350
And I have an interesting perspective. This is annoying, but it's related.

426
00:45:41,380 --> 00:45:46,170
What about, like, the death penalty? I don't even do that.

427
00:45:46,180 --> 00:45:52,010
Like, legal intervention is is is accountable during legal. It's interesting.

428
00:45:52,660 --> 00:45:56,370
I guess I like law enforcement analysis as it is considering the various categories.

429
00:45:57,750 --> 00:46:05,180
That's how it's categorized as like a law enforcement. I think that broader terms of intervention in the mind of supporters.

430
00:46:11,800 --> 00:46:19,540
And where is intervention? I mean, seriously, you're moving into you're moving into ethics.

431
00:46:19,540 --> 00:46:23,290
You're moving into different spaces.

432
00:46:23,830 --> 00:46:26,710
We're in this particular context. You're kind of overlapping.

433
00:46:27,190 --> 00:46:34,990
You can talk to folks up in the agency who think through more of these concerns and whether this should be categorized as an injury versus not.

434
00:46:35,650 --> 00:46:41,290
I would push us to think through how this really kind of manifests in practice

435
00:46:41,620 --> 00:46:46,390
and what is it that our position would be or what is our goal for making?

436
00:46:47,050 --> 00:46:48,490
I mean, improving public welfare?

437
00:46:48,730 --> 00:46:58,240
Is it trying to intervene to stop or is it trying to help survivors or is it trying to build in some of the structural policies that

438
00:46:58,240 --> 00:47:06,040
would allow this to happen in the confines of one's home versus under a very kind of medicalized or sterilized condition or whatever?

439
00:47:06,940 --> 00:47:09,010
I mean, I don't have answers to those things.

440
00:47:09,670 --> 00:47:17,070
I don't know how relevant that will be for career paths, but those are, I feel like, within our purview, if it is within, you know,

441
00:47:17,140 --> 00:47:24,640
if it is something that's sort of, you know, quote unquote, having an injury, you could start to think of and where is where's our space?

442
00:47:24,820 --> 00:47:27,680
How can we do that and all of this? Right.

443
00:47:27,700 --> 00:47:35,859
I mean, all I mean, you can you can couch any of these things into what's happening with at the multiple levels, economic,

444
00:47:35,860 --> 00:47:44,170
legal policy, biological factors, physiological, psychological, all this kind of in here, which makes for fun and interesting stuff.

445
00:47:44,720 --> 00:47:51,370
It's funny. I'm sorry. It's I think this is very interesting and I think it's fun on culture.

446
00:47:52,820 --> 00:47:57,180
Right. And pressure to talk more about culture and how it relates to.

447
00:47:59,220 --> 00:48:03,209
Its influence on interests and what's acceptable and what's not.

448
00:48:03,210 --> 00:48:10,980
Exactly what's categorized with Matt Cartwright, who is counted very directly first and I counted.

449
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:17,060
If I do a logical injury outside the United States.

450
00:48:17,450 --> 00:48:20,870
Yes, you should. I'm so sorry.

451
00:48:21,080 --> 00:48:25,400
You? Absolutely, I. I feel very strongly that, like, America doesn't.

452
00:48:25,880 --> 00:48:33,700
Like. We could be better by asking other countries, like, say, how other, like, places are doing public health.

453
00:48:33,720 --> 00:48:41,290
Like, it's not like all the public health professionals in America can just do everything perfectly and like they do a lot.

454
00:48:41,290 --> 00:48:47,840
That's great. Not to say they don't, but there's other public health professions that also do things that are great can be learning from them.

455
00:48:47,960 --> 00:48:55,130
It should be a network should be telling me, Tell me how long you really should speak out.

456
00:48:56,420 --> 00:49:03,140
Tell me what happened, what would my intervention look like or how is it different when it comes to like 11 kids in a car?

457
00:49:03,770 --> 00:49:07,070
No one would do that and nothing ever. Why do you think?

458
00:49:07,310 --> 00:49:10,350
Because they're afraid that someone's gonna, like, kidnaped.

459
00:49:10,370 --> 00:49:14,120
Because the girls are like.

460
00:49:14,150 --> 00:49:17,710
It's not even on the radar to be like a person like this.

461
00:49:17,870 --> 00:49:23,449
It's like, that's not on anybody's. Okay, so context is different.

462
00:49:23,450 --> 00:49:28,179
So the concerns would be different. The likelihood and prevalence of injuries is going to be a little bit different.

463
00:49:28,180 --> 00:49:33,110
Different. And like one thing, for example, you don't see here a lot,

464
00:49:33,440 --> 00:49:40,370
which is Big Empire Almonds or in Lebanon as well, when they celebrate some people they shoot up in the air.

465
00:49:41,930 --> 00:49:50,030
Know never heard about this. This is actually like maybe the main cause of how people die when it comes to firearms.

466
00:49:50,030 --> 00:49:54,410
And my country is very different from here.

467
00:49:54,590 --> 00:50:03,880
And like, even though also like a lot of people don't own firearms, there's never ever, ever been a school shooting.

468
00:50:06,090 --> 00:50:08,960
Like, we don't have like mental problems. We do.

469
00:50:09,260 --> 00:50:18,290
Because, I mean, probably I don't know, I don't want to throw statistics, but I'm pretty sure most of the people there are depressed.

470
00:50:21,080 --> 00:50:29,320
That's almost like we joke that they should. But then I said, that wasn't so great.

471
00:50:29,910 --> 00:50:35,030
Oh, very high security. I think it was around 80% recently.

472
00:50:35,430 --> 00:50:39,660
Yeah, it's a very high. It wasn't that bad, but. No, no.

473
00:50:41,140 --> 00:50:45,940
So. Yeah, I appreciate it.

474
00:50:46,090 --> 00:50:47,979
Yeah, I appreciate it. Oh, yeah.

475
00:50:47,980 --> 00:50:54,910
I was just going to say, like, exactly the way that I know to, like, model our public health interventions after other countries.

476
00:50:54,910 --> 00:50:56,960
However, like, of, like.

477
00:50:57,910 --> 00:51:06,460
So like it's really difficult to like anticipate how like those can be translated to the U.S. just because, like, the culture is so different.

478
00:51:06,970 --> 00:51:12,560
Like. Might not be as easy to adopt as it is in other countries.

479
00:51:12,560 --> 00:51:16,580
And there again, I mean, just the different voices around the table.

480
00:51:16,610 --> 00:51:20,990
I love the fact that one of my close colleagues in Berkshire made some of you with my take.

481
00:51:22,160 --> 00:51:26,120
She's Taiwanese and she's a firearms researcher. And so when she goes back home this month,

482
00:51:28,280 --> 00:51:33,560
I don't know where to talk to my colleagues about it because it's not an issue in the same way that in the United States.

483
00:51:34,490 --> 00:51:38,030
Also, it's not as though they're not firearms, they're different concerns.

484
00:51:38,720 --> 00:51:44,360
And that might lend to different perspectives or different ways or other ways to adapt countries prevention

485
00:51:44,360 --> 00:51:50,689
that could be happening in different countries here or and we might find that just the context,

486
00:51:50,690 --> 00:51:52,970
the cultures, whichever, are not going to apply.

487
00:51:53,650 --> 00:52:03,050
So yeah, but also I want to say like, um, I just like a sort of New Zealand, like the whole firearm thing.

488
00:52:03,260 --> 00:52:07,400
So I just bring it both like they change the laws overnight.

489
00:52:07,610 --> 00:52:12,710
Mm hmm. The the way the media acted was so different.

490
00:52:12,740 --> 00:52:19,160
The way they read the whole situation was like, Canada is so, like, all over.

491
00:52:19,550 --> 00:52:23,170
I just. And I was just like, oh, yeah.

492
00:52:23,180 --> 00:52:27,260
So I think we can learn a lot from them. Yeah. Yeah, it's doable.

493
00:52:30,290 --> 00:52:39,920
I looked at it. I think it would be hard to adopt other countries, like for lots of different things because one, the U.S. is a supplier of weapons.

494
00:52:40,850 --> 00:52:49,400
So that would require higher reconstruction of how we far as like economics, how we generate money.

495
00:52:49,970 --> 00:52:55,490
Consider where we supply I think the laws that are in place here as obviously very different.

496
00:52:55,940 --> 00:53:03,499
And I think the other ways here impacts our culture as compared to other countries.

497
00:53:03,500 --> 00:53:12,500
But then I think when it comes to having legal change and things like that, we would natural people's response would be to go against it.

498
00:53:12,710 --> 00:53:19,370
Because you're talking about our Constitution has been around for how long versus where other countries don't have similar constitutions.

499
00:53:19,370 --> 00:53:29,870
So you're talking about a behavior that has been practiced for a century years, and we're just coming in and saying for once, most think that is it.

500
00:53:31,700 --> 00:53:36,700
Norway, isn't that the biggest one's going to say like Norway does this,

501
00:53:36,770 --> 00:53:42,290
we should do that, I don't think, because it's like, okay, again, Norway has this.

502
00:53:43,400 --> 00:53:49,440
This is what they've done. They cultivate, they've tailored it over the years and have people adapt to it.

503
00:53:49,450 --> 00:53:55,790
So to take something from them. If you're in the U.S., you would just have I don't think you would see the same results.

504
00:53:56,780 --> 00:54:04,690
But I do think if we did, it would have to be if we wanted to compare and look, it would have to be on equal level.

505
00:54:04,700 --> 00:54:08,749
I think we would have to look at industrialized countries and progressive countries.

506
00:54:08,750 --> 00:54:12,700
That's on the same level as the U.S. Yeah, I'm sorry.

507
00:54:13,150 --> 00:54:18,260
Sorry. I feel like this is where the community capacity building really comes into play.

508
00:54:19,610 --> 00:54:28,790
Oh, just because I want it to be like trying to part with people in economic functions in the U.S. based on.

509
00:54:32,420 --> 00:54:37,370
You probably died before that happened. Unless you're very lucky or perseverance.

510
00:54:37,390 --> 00:54:41,200
But in terms of re translating work done at the community level,

511
00:54:41,200 --> 00:54:48,219
particularly for populations in the U.S. that either aren't as well understood or well reach out to already have,

512
00:54:48,220 --> 00:54:55,300
I think would be necessary to address the burden of injury within those communities and re translating into other communities.

513
00:54:55,600 --> 00:55:00,700
And that's the kind of practice the researcher or can you raise participatory pieces

514
00:55:00,750 --> 00:55:06,470
that brings good balance which I know I represented in her curricular answer.

515
00:55:06,490 --> 00:55:13,420
Like I just lay out the conversation and try to adapt like other international inventions, like more at home.

516
00:55:13,420 --> 00:55:17,050
Because I think like yes, there is a lot to learn from other countries.

517
00:55:17,060 --> 00:55:21,910
I do agree that it is very, very difficult to implement.

518
00:55:23,710 --> 00:55:27,040
Is it theoretically difficult? I don't think so.

519
00:55:27,040 --> 00:55:33,460
I mean, for example, we spent like, I don't know, everyone's opinions, but if we spend a little bit less money on our military funding,

520
00:55:33,610 --> 00:55:40,299
our aircraft carrier, you can probably put a little bit more money in our health care system and change the insurance company.

521
00:55:40,300 --> 00:55:46,300
Like I know there would be a lot of pushback, but theoretically it's like we have two places we could divert funds from.

522
00:55:47,080 --> 00:55:52,719
It's all just the politics of it, like in the fight against general firearms a lot.

523
00:55:52,720 --> 00:55:58,390
I mean, you don't see many firearms deaths in the UK because they don't have firearms.

524
00:55:58,390 --> 00:56:01,540
Think it's just like it's against the law in most circumstances.

525
00:56:01,540 --> 00:56:06,520
So. Yeah. How about we vote?

526
00:56:08,110 --> 00:56:17,499
So I would really like indefinitely repurposing funds to other areas, but I think just the tide of the US carries and this is all we have.

527
00:56:17,500 --> 00:56:22,110
It would be very hard if we, if we drop one. There was an eagle list and we dropped down.

528
00:56:22,120 --> 00:56:27,340
I think a lot of people would have said. Be careful with whatever could happen.

529
00:56:30,330 --> 00:56:35,090
And I'm hopeful with our age, age, demographic future.

530
00:56:35,690 --> 00:56:42,860
Speaker The political campaigns, mainly these people who are making dioramas of what the world wants.

531
00:56:43,720 --> 00:56:48,590
Mr. Look. I'm sir.

532
00:56:48,750 --> 00:57:04,050
I know it's difficult because it's we are on earth, but I don't I feel like because we cannot knowledge it is difficult,

533
00:57:04,200 --> 00:57:11,070
but like it is kind of insane to me that with regard to politics and legality,

534
00:57:11,490 --> 00:57:18,000
like it's so much easier for America to go to other countries, develop interventions, be involved elsewhere.

535
00:57:18,360 --> 00:57:22,979
But it's much more difficult for other countries to comprehend work or where I'm from,

536
00:57:22,980 --> 00:57:26,940
public health professionals like in the forefront of global public health.

537
00:57:27,360 --> 00:57:31,620
You're there all the time. All of you American students can go elsewhere.

538
00:57:32,640 --> 00:57:40,700
What about public health students coming here as Americans, as we've established so many things going on, people could learn from it.

539
00:57:40,710 --> 00:57:45,780
And it's just like that to me. I'm always like, that's an opportunity that is not like that.

540
00:57:45,780 --> 00:57:55,179
Could be like a start is like education for people I think is a kind of a reasonable doorway, but it's not going to be easy.

541
00:57:55,180 --> 00:58:12,170
But I think very like it, it could be done. Important thing for me is that folks can translate what we talk about in this classroom,

542
00:58:12,560 --> 00:58:15,560
in our privileged positions to be able to have this conversation. Yes.

543
00:58:17,420 --> 00:58:23,600
But into practice, I talk to my colleagues about the kind of work that we do.

544
00:58:23,600 --> 00:58:28,430
And I describe myself as a driving drive train instructor. I don't get to set the speed limits.

545
00:58:28,550 --> 00:58:30,740
I don't get to scale the rules of the road out of the car.

546
00:58:31,340 --> 00:58:36,560
My job is to help the students learn to drive as safely as possible under those constraints.

547
00:58:37,130 --> 00:58:45,110
That said, there's no reason why folks can't direct your attention and your efforts to some of these seemingly intractable pieces.

548
00:58:45,590 --> 00:58:47,690
You don't have to be the driver's training instructor.

549
00:58:47,690 --> 00:58:57,290
You can focus on the car or on the student or on the policies that really take a shot at being a researcher advocate.

550
00:58:58,160 --> 00:59:02,410
Why not use research in a way that's not typically used with media?

551
00:59:03,080 --> 00:59:08,000
You have a skill set. You have data, which I think is always going to be superior to no data.

552
00:59:08,900 --> 00:59:13,340
And that's one of the refrains from this class. Most of the classes that I teach,

553
00:59:13,340 --> 00:59:23,320
I do think it's helpful to use our scientific language and approach to try to make a case in whatever field or facet that you render, for example.

554
00:59:23,510 --> 00:59:31,360
So I don't want to discourage folks away from the many different ways that you've already talked about trying to engage a problem like injury.

555
00:59:31,370 --> 00:59:34,890
Are you talking about it from a community perspective or are we talking about making an economic argument?

556
00:59:34,910 --> 00:59:38,270
We're talking about legal stuff or physical environment we didn't really touched on.

557
00:59:38,270 --> 00:59:43,610
But social structures, culture, yes. There are 204 sorry, 400 million firearms in this country.

558
00:59:43,880 --> 00:59:50,120
You're not going to change that. My favorite analogy of all time is a speaker like the idea that there's going to be some giant

559
00:59:50,120 --> 00:59:55,280
magnet who's going to come through all the guns and they'll magically disappear is not tenable.

560
00:59:56,060 --> 01:00:00,590
So then knowing that constraint, where do you focus your time, your attention, your effort?

561
01:00:00,770 --> 01:00:04,190
How are you going to start making a difference in this and these particular problems?

562
01:00:04,460 --> 01:00:08,570
And I know those are difficult questions to answer and maybe even to reflect on,

563
01:00:08,870 --> 01:00:12,560
but if you do decide to ensure the imagery space, nobody is going to be frustrated.

564
01:00:13,460 --> 01:00:18,800
But at the same time it can be really rewarding and it's not confined to what's just out there now.

565
01:00:19,070 --> 01:00:25,190
There's no reason why you couldn't spend time trying to find ways to make more of our ability

566
01:00:25,190 --> 01:00:28,940
to bring more people working in public health from around the globe to the United States.

567
01:00:30,050 --> 01:00:34,010
Yeah, I get that. We need jobs and we need to find the institutions that will support that.

568
01:00:34,640 --> 01:00:35,870
But that starts from the ground up.

569
01:00:36,470 --> 01:00:45,890
There is some momentum in this generation of of politics, which seems different from when I was your age so long ago.

570
01:00:48,380 --> 01:00:53,630
Catalyzed go for it. And if you feel like the academy is a place where you can be making your change

571
01:00:53,630 --> 01:00:56,810
in difference by speaking to the next generation of injury practitioners,

572
01:00:57,230 --> 01:01:02,900
then that's where you want to be operating. If it's working for the government, if it's working for local, it's working with other communities.

573
01:01:03,260 --> 01:01:10,040
All right. You're not able to take the real holistic approach I think you can keep in the back of your mind as you start to carve out your mission.

574
01:01:10,700 --> 01:01:18,500
So that's my unsolicited recommendation or perspective on how to begin thinking through intervention because.

575
01:01:19,840 --> 01:01:23,410
I see it in my field kind of throughout April.

576
01:01:23,420 --> 01:01:27,040
The only ones are going after that policy.

577
01:01:27,040 --> 01:01:30,550
Want to see or oppose a red flag was in the state of Michigan.

578
01:01:30,610 --> 01:01:34,569
That's the contribution. I'm not touching policy and that's because I don't think it's important,

579
01:01:34,570 --> 01:01:39,550
because I think my best opportunity to make a change in squirrely environments is not through policy,

580
01:01:39,700 --> 01:01:44,260
through direct intervention, or supporting the development of our implementation of policies.

581
01:01:44,710 --> 01:01:48,630
You get to make that decision for yourself as you start to work on the space station.

582
01:01:51,530 --> 01:01:55,310
You folks are smart. You really are. I see it.

583
01:01:56,120 --> 01:01:59,900
So it's it's just where you're going to invest your effort.

584
01:02:00,590 --> 01:02:04,370
And I do hope you're considering it, because we need a lot. All right.

585
01:02:05,150 --> 01:02:10,430
So we're going to study you areas of this.

586
01:02:14,660 --> 01:02:19,010
Maybe just this part being a little more focused in terms of what you're actually trying to

587
01:02:19,010 --> 01:02:23,600
accomplish and doesn't mean it's when you write down some aims that they're solidifying there,

588
01:02:23,600 --> 01:02:36,800
you're not there and now able. But I think this is where we can start to identify some of those key opportunities for change.

589
01:02:38,390 --> 01:02:43,940
Write them down. Set goals. Achievable goals for smart goals at this point.

590
01:02:44,270 --> 01:02:49,219
Write smart objectives. Trying to crafting those, drafting those that are going to help you guys.

591
01:02:49,220 --> 01:02:54,950
Your work is going to be important. And then drawing down on paper, a couple of good reasons to turn down on paper.

592
01:02:54,950 --> 01:03:02,930
One gives you something to follow, to give you something to to share your work and try to get others excited or motivated to know what you're doing.

593
01:03:03,260 --> 01:03:09,890
And they could be partners, that could be funders, that could be an added figure in any sort of stakeholders.

594
01:03:10,310 --> 01:03:16,670
There is something still powerful about communication, whatever form it takes.

595
01:03:18,540 --> 01:03:23,100
Yeah. Question about the brief. Do you usually create that first or last?

596
01:03:23,490 --> 01:03:27,870
I think it's best to create the last laugh. Yeah, because you're kind of reflecting on all.

597
01:03:27,870 --> 01:03:31,470
That's actually one reason why you would change the assignment to this person.

598
01:03:31,950 --> 01:03:39,000
Every generation. Yes. A little. Yes. It is it is usually summative and it's just trying to highlight those main points.

599
01:03:39,190 --> 01:03:49,040
Yes. And he said it.

600
01:03:56,570 --> 01:04:06,450
Speaker talked about this. I forget. Know, remember?

601
01:04:11,520 --> 01:04:18,670
His meal at the Rutgers women's.

602
01:04:24,380 --> 01:04:29,190
Do you remember? But one always.

603
01:04:29,250 --> 01:04:35,989
I agree with the point. I think that's interesting but is in some ways is is also and is ethical.

604
01:04:35,990 --> 01:04:42,140
That to me is do we hear them say why or why not?

605
01:04:44,810 --> 01:04:58,520
And I think that and I'm just assuming here in this program you this good and objections the flip about this every says yes why.

606
01:05:02,550 --> 01:05:10,640
I don't. I think that that ever makes people want to participate.

607
01:05:13,140 --> 01:05:18,630
Okay. That's to say. Your existence is the crux of the problem.

608
01:05:19,650 --> 01:05:23,880
I think that fact is helpful.

609
01:05:24,330 --> 01:05:35,230
I guess also maybe I just think that there's so many system level problems that are the major issue that I.

610
01:05:35,490 --> 01:05:39,990
I think that that being said, like focus on an intervention.

611
01:05:41,750 --> 01:05:45,250
This is like so many other pieces.

612
01:05:45,590 --> 01:05:50,540
And I also think people are going to like mistakes and.

613
01:05:52,140 --> 01:05:59,360
They're trying to change their fundamental nature of your party with people that and I.

614
01:06:04,790 --> 01:06:16,310
Yeah. Yeah. Like, I mean, I agree with it in a sense that don't try and force it because like, I think people can change their fundamental nature.

615
01:06:16,940 --> 01:06:23,120
I think that's part of what makes us human. But if you try to like force it on people through whatever means,

616
01:06:23,120 --> 01:06:29,810
but if you're just like from I just like promote it and like explain to people

617
01:06:29,840 --> 01:06:33,080
where the positives of this change that like that type of thing don't create.

618
01:06:34,220 --> 01:06:37,580
Here's the rule you have. Follow it. Otherwise there's consequences.

619
01:06:37,960 --> 01:06:40,520
Yeah, essentially. Yeah.

620
01:06:41,480 --> 01:06:51,710
I'm thinking the way that our conception of the nation and at first we thought we a lot of but then all of the research showed that that never works.

621
01:06:52,280 --> 01:06:55,310
You really cannot change that. This is not the way to go.

622
01:06:56,000 --> 01:07:05,720
So now I thought I was going to say it's kind of like how a people's environment as opposed to the building and who they are.

623
01:07:05,750 --> 01:07:10,160
So if you change their fundamental core, then how will they survive in their apartment?

624
01:07:10,340 --> 01:07:14,840
I know that in Pakistan. So. I guess not.

625
01:07:15,530 --> 01:07:20,929
I guess the goal isn't to change them, I guess is to learn how to coexist in different spaces.

626
01:07:20,930 --> 01:07:24,750
Environment. He's probably.

627
01:07:25,770 --> 01:07:29,730
People in Empower. Teamwork.

628
01:07:30,600 --> 01:07:33,390
What we talk about is a lot of communication, too, because.

629
01:07:36,060 --> 01:07:45,090
It's really hard to communicate risk by telling by the prescriptive or by being paternalistic.

630
01:07:46,470 --> 01:07:54,190
Intervention is similar because people are valuable or felt vulnerable.

631
01:07:55,380 --> 01:08:01,400
You know they're going to make mistakes and get hurt. Like they do develop survival skills based on their environment.

632
01:08:01,410 --> 01:08:04,850
So. I think you need to.

633
01:08:06,260 --> 01:08:11,960
Yeah, I think you I think you need to focus on empowerment because it meets them where they are.

634
01:08:13,340 --> 01:08:17,000
I couldn't say it better, but I think it's better.

635
01:08:17,810 --> 01:08:23,210
Yeah, I think it's one of them. Tough pill to swallow and that we can't.

636
01:08:24,070 --> 01:08:30,700
We have, as we should. But I think it creates the opportunity to see what does matter to you.

637
01:08:30,940 --> 01:08:37,920
I for you to want to change this. If it's not your own personal health and maybe, you know, being there for your family or your friends.

638
01:08:38,580 --> 01:08:43,350
But what is that motivator then for you or for your community that will work?

639
01:08:48,480 --> 01:08:56,230
So there is some perspective shifting empowerment, maybe community focus or kind of special focus, right?

640
01:09:00,400 --> 01:09:07,030
Social determinants of health. Yes. So change to what surrounds in.

641
01:09:13,100 --> 01:09:23,300
Reminders. Give reminders. I think feeling so few people even know what public health is that like, number one.

642
01:09:24,620 --> 01:09:38,299
Number two, I think specifically just what I spend time at the beach this summer that their population is so specific and

643
01:09:38,300 --> 01:09:50,060
the majority of their population is from the same generation that any of the social determinants of health

644
01:09:50,060 --> 01:09:57,290
interventions that they're implementing is with that they can't change the fundamental nature of the specific

645
01:09:57,290 --> 01:10:05,029
generation that they're working with in that they have to help change the way that providers are thinking,

646
01:10:05,030 --> 01:10:16,130
the way that they're screening, and the way that they are giving resources rather than trying to change like.

647
01:10:18,440 --> 01:10:21,710
Rather than trying to think of a specific example.

648
01:10:23,090 --> 01:10:29,450
But that then. Rather than trying to.

649
01:10:30,110 --> 01:10:38,900
Rather than trying to think. Rather than trying to force veterans to think more about the agency within their medical care,

650
01:10:39,170 --> 01:10:46,130
they're just kind of changing it for them, which can be backwards in some other contexts.

651
01:10:47,500 --> 01:10:52,219
But yeah, so for them,

652
01:10:52,220 --> 01:11:03,230
they're kind of they're working more on the things outside of veteran care than necessarily informing them to the greatest degree,

653
01:11:03,590 --> 01:11:10,910
because their population kind of wants to be provided for, not wants.

654
01:11:11,240 --> 01:11:14,300
Like they're not huge advocates on their own behalf.

655
01:11:15,210 --> 01:11:15,710
That makes sense.

656
01:11:18,080 --> 01:11:28,400
So they are just kind of they're functioning around the fundamental nature of the specific generation of people out there working with as of now.

657
01:11:28,850 --> 01:11:30,830
And who's to say that that will change in the future?

658
01:11:31,160 --> 01:11:40,130
But their current models focus most solely on the fundamental nature of their main population, which is already highly specific.

659
01:11:45,940 --> 01:11:53,590
You? Yeah. Now this here's.

660
01:11:56,570 --> 01:12:09,470
Yeah. All right. Yeah. So I'm just thinking that you can probably do some change, just like I was age, like, and like.

661
01:12:10,340 --> 01:12:16,430
Yeah, exactly. Like in school and elementary, you can start, like, doing some things about guns.

662
01:12:17,030 --> 01:12:25,640
So I believe they can do sometimes. But once someone like 60 and you're like trying to convince him of other things that are like your chances.

663
01:12:28,560 --> 01:12:34,330
Also, you ever get my chance? I don't think you ever get funding for trying to change the fundamental nature.

664
01:12:34,350 --> 01:12:37,770
Right. Yeah. It's just not feasible.

665
01:12:41,640 --> 01:12:49,920
So I think a similar is I think a big focus of injury prevention should be timing.

666
01:12:50,250 --> 01:12:55,800
When the intervention is at the time in the intervention, it's taking place.

667
01:12:57,690 --> 01:13:04,829
Not to say that I kind of give like I give up on everyone before me and like changing their fundamental behaviors.

668
01:13:04,830 --> 01:13:11,400
But I think a lot of our efforts have mostly been focused on youth, understanding that they are tomorrow's leaders and things,

669
01:13:12,870 --> 01:13:18,030
and that if we implement these interventions behaviors and it becomes a new practice,

670
01:13:18,480 --> 01:13:24,770
then we can see a shift in whatever public health issue we're trying to address.

671
01:13:24,780 --> 01:13:33,269
I think it just starts there because what the the way I see it is if we're attacking or if we're not attacking,

672
01:13:33,270 --> 01:13:40,290
but if we're trying to change behaviors and grandparents or parents, the child is already raised to see those behaviors.

673
01:13:40,560 --> 01:13:45,950
So now we've got to try to teach the child what they learned from that, obviously.

674
01:13:48,530 --> 01:13:54,049
About authority figure. So it kind of just like has to be in the spiral effect.

675
01:13:54,050 --> 01:14:02,810
So if that can't be a comment about that, when he mentioned that when he meets a youth in it,

676
01:14:02,810 --> 01:14:11,000
it's already too late, the the injuries already happened. The determinants of that injury could have happened well, long before that.

677
01:14:11,000 --> 01:14:17,030
So how do you how do you assess or intervene in something that could have the seeds of which might have started years earlier?

678
01:14:19,740 --> 01:14:27,050
You had another challenge in this field. Now, you brought up a point.

679
01:14:27,970 --> 01:14:32,990
It's curious. The smallest engine, I swear. I walked into this building ten years ago.

680
01:14:33,170 --> 01:14:36,499
I had no idea what public health was. No idea?

681
01:14:36,500 --> 01:14:39,800
I thought I was enough. I'm serious. Thanks for letting me teach you.

682
01:14:41,600 --> 01:14:49,370
How did you find out about public health? For me, it was my senior year of undergrad when I found out somebody had.

683
01:14:49,730 --> 01:14:53,420
They were like, I'm in a public health program. And they were doing a four plus one program here.

684
01:14:53,930 --> 01:15:00,560
And I was like, was public health? All right. And to be fair, when I applied to college, I only only knew that it was illness.

685
01:15:00,590 --> 01:15:03,649
And I didn't know that it was an engineering and public health thing.

686
01:15:03,650 --> 01:15:06,680
Only just as long as one cough. Right. That's just nerves.

687
01:15:07,070 --> 01:15:11,660
Yeah. Yeah. I was like the other Michigan out of college. Michigan 19 schools.

688
01:15:11,660 --> 01:15:15,200
You have all these and you find out? I probably have.

689
01:15:18,030 --> 01:15:25,890
Yeah. Yeah. In undergrad, UConn did not have the public health program, so I wouldn't have known what that was anyway.

690
01:15:26,220 --> 01:15:35,580
But in one of the internships I completed was the person who was the P.A. on the study was trying to mentor us or whatever.

691
01:15:35,580 --> 01:15:41,309
So talking about interests and stuff, she was like, Maybe you should try public health.

692
01:15:41,310 --> 01:15:43,170
And I was just like, I don't even know what that is.

693
01:15:43,170 --> 01:15:51,580
But I looked it up and then I was referred to an injury fellowship my senior year, and I guess I like this there.

694
01:15:52,710 --> 01:15:57,870
And the undergrad was a psychology major and after the research program and.

695
01:15:58,870 --> 01:16:01,060
Put me in a public health club without telling me.

696
01:16:07,300 --> 01:16:17,470
I mean, I would say partially demand regret, but I remember I originally went there to be a P.A. and I know I have to sing COVID.

697
01:16:17,770 --> 01:16:23,839
Yeah, because, like, that's the there there's a public health officials have been recommending new practice for

698
01:16:23,840 --> 01:16:28,480
Britain for preventing COVID and the epidemiologists and this and that like from the CDC.

699
01:16:29,380 --> 01:16:34,000
That's like really I think what sparked a lot of my interest in it that I took

700
01:16:34,000 --> 01:16:38,500
like a program development class that was like looking at health interventions.

701
01:16:38,500 --> 01:16:42,280
That was for public health reasons. I think also when you say public health.

702
01:16:42,620 --> 01:16:47,390
Think environmental are these? They're just my perspective. It's part of environmental.

703
01:16:47,420 --> 01:16:50,780
Not really like. Like the speech writes and stuff like that.

704
01:16:50,780 --> 01:16:56,710
So. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

705
01:16:57,620 --> 01:17:02,900
I just have a feeling that I'm going to be a registered dietitian, that I was a bit of chemistry.

706
01:17:03,200 --> 01:17:08,029
So yeah, I think like that's a little taken so far,

707
01:17:08,030 --> 01:17:12,859
but it was more of a natural fit for me just because like instead of focusing on one like discipline,

708
01:17:12,860 --> 01:17:19,460
you can like work with all of them and approach problems from like a social insurance health perspective.

709
01:17:20,090 --> 01:17:29,020
And I still like didn't really know that much about when I was doing my undergrad, but I, I did like,

710
01:17:29,340 --> 01:17:35,030
like most schools don't offer all of these options for me to be able to go in so many different directions in public health,

711
01:17:35,030 --> 01:17:38,479
which you can look at home health equipment,

712
01:17:38,480 --> 01:17:46,610
I don't think I would have even begin to understood how like wide the range of like careers you could go into,

713
01:17:46,610 --> 01:17:53,239
I guess like an MPH if I didn't go here versus like if I applied to like Green Valley to grown up and they only have two tracks,

714
01:17:53,240 --> 01:17:56,120
they have behavioral health and they have epidemiology and that's it.

715
01:17:56,120 --> 01:18:04,190
And I feel like a lot of people can like go through and get a public health education and not even fully understand what they can do with it.

716
01:18:04,220 --> 01:18:09,680
Just because it's not like super it now, it's a lot more popular than it was.

717
01:18:09,710 --> 01:18:13,730
Right. All the programs don't have like the. At least we do.

718
01:18:15,590 --> 01:18:19,920
Professors and researchers. Wow.

719
01:18:20,700 --> 01:18:26,159
I wonder if Yankovic could have a shift. I know it's a little fever, and I don't hear anybody saying it since I was five years old.

720
01:18:26,160 --> 01:18:30,880
I want to go fishing. But yeah, I mean, we'll see.

721
01:18:30,900 --> 01:18:35,700
I think just the more folks that we do get interested in this space or take public health

722
01:18:35,700 --> 01:18:41,460
perspectives might make moving the needle on some of our concerns of interest a little easier.

723
01:18:41,730 --> 01:18:47,100
I think there's an interest to have more faculty who don't really have focus in public focus.

724
01:18:48,120 --> 01:18:53,610
You know? Yeah, yeah, absolutely. So it's like public health is a combination of a lot of it, right?

725
01:18:53,700 --> 01:18:57,430
We just happen to come together on one focus for sure.

726
01:18:57,470 --> 01:19:03,760
Yeah, I'm here because I'm a psychiatrist. I can test interventions and I just run quantitative models and global scales.

727
01:19:03,780 --> 01:19:05,860
And that's why I here. Yeah.

728
01:19:06,030 --> 01:19:17,280
I think even more to your point that none of my roommates are in public health and so all like come home from class and then I tell them about like,

729
01:19:17,280 --> 01:19:22,169
oh my God, this person came and talked to my class today and like, that doesn't relate to health.

730
01:19:22,170 --> 01:19:24,600
And I'm like, Oh, but it does. And let me tell you why.

731
01:19:24,930 --> 01:19:35,370
And so I think I think that's just another focus of it, that throughout as the university has expanded its undergrad program,

732
01:19:35,820 --> 01:19:45,640
that and even having the majority of faculty not specifically in public health that the bubble is wide open.

733
01:19:47,950 --> 01:19:52,409
Well. And more more schools across the country are starting develop programs.

734
01:19:52,410 --> 01:19:57,930
So you might again see more and more of friendly faces of the professional world as more and more people are exposed to public health.

735
01:19:58,230 --> 01:19:58,980
We all are now.

736
01:19:59,220 --> 01:20:08,310
Whether they want it to be or not, we've talked about models and different kind of combinations of which we don't necessarily need to go through.

737
01:20:08,850 --> 01:20:13,920
I think we're at this point pretty well versed in thinking holistically about problems.

738
01:20:15,330 --> 01:20:26,820
I have to. I cannot. I'd be remiss to leave you without going back to our roots and thinking kind of theoretically about things.

739
01:20:27,480 --> 01:20:31,290
There is, I believe, genuinely that some space for deeper thinking.

740
01:20:32,010 --> 01:20:36,989
Yes, practice oriented orientation is wonderful. It's where you can see a change manifested.

741
01:20:36,990 --> 01:20:48,090
But spend a little time and just a real time if you can spirit to think through why these variables and how these things relate to each other.

742
01:20:48,390 --> 01:20:55,890
What are those key constructs of interest? Can we borrow from our field different fields to approach this problem?

743
01:20:56,340 --> 01:21:01,380
I do think it's going to help you in your work, and particularly if you do get into the intervention design space,

744
01:21:02,220 --> 01:21:07,440
if you're writing proposals and or policy briefs are trying to make the case to have a framework

745
01:21:07,440 --> 01:21:11,459
which you can kind of refer to that suggests I'm not just manifesting this out of thin air,

746
01:21:11,460 --> 01:21:15,360
but it's it is theoretically driven.

747
01:21:15,900 --> 01:21:21,030
I'm borrowing from the knowledge that came before me. I think it can be very powerful.

748
01:21:21,150 --> 01:21:22,389
Just like that data piece.

749
01:21:22,390 --> 01:21:30,030
So even though I tend to be partial towards the data and we've learned how to find some of this information or find data in our class,

750
01:21:31,260 --> 01:21:34,620
you know, a good theory can be a it can be a nice little boost.

751
01:21:34,620 --> 01:21:42,200
And then. Especially this target mechanisms for change.

752
01:21:42,680 --> 01:21:48,200
What is your budget for this? How come this happens? Why is this injury occurring?

753
01:21:48,320 --> 01:21:52,459
Let's work backwards. All those different areas that we kind of figure, all the things that are contributing,

754
01:21:52,460 --> 01:21:56,000
all the social determinants, all the individual factor and contextual factors.

755
01:21:56,660 --> 01:22:01,940
Once you start getting all that stuff straight, then, all right, well, this is where I spend my time.

756
01:22:10,060 --> 01:22:17,140
Yes, I know it's not always easy, but you guys began. And then near and dear to my heart.

757
01:22:17,560 --> 01:22:22,570
We didn't get as much time to talk about this stuff within the class.

758
01:22:23,350 --> 01:22:28,570
But if you're going to invest all your time and resources in trying to do something, try to make some of these changes,

759
01:22:29,230 --> 01:22:34,060
whether it's even at the policy level, all the way down to individual specific behavioral change interventions.

760
01:22:35,080 --> 01:22:40,209
Try to incorporate some evaluation of the work that you're doing is nearly universal.

761
01:22:40,210 --> 01:22:44,320
That evaluation gets kind of short shrift. It gets the least amount of funding.

762
01:22:45,070 --> 01:22:53,740
It's an afterthought. It's not always obvious that it can be incorporated, but whether we're talking quality improvement all the way up through,

763
01:22:54,340 --> 01:22:58,090
how am I going to do a cost benefit analysis above all, whether or not we want to scale this up?

764
01:22:58,510 --> 01:23:02,740
All of that can have some documentation, some form of evaluation.

765
01:23:02,980 --> 01:23:07,090
It'll help you guide whether the work is moving forward versus not.

766
01:23:07,750 --> 01:23:17,140
It'll force you to delineate outcomes and what's measurable and kind of reflect back on sort of the change that you're making.

767
01:23:17,470 --> 01:23:26,050
Otherwise, you can think about it. Without that, it's very easy to fall into a trap of sort of cherry picking the things that are, you know,

768
01:23:26,680 --> 01:23:32,979
representative of change when they might not be or making repeated mistakes or losing some

769
01:23:32,980 --> 01:23:38,440
of the losing some of the rigor about the evidence that you're starting to generate here.

770
01:23:38,440 --> 01:23:44,230
But that sounds like folks will be taking most of you will be taking evaluation next year.

771
01:23:47,110 --> 01:23:56,320
But good class who listen to the lectures and think about how you can apply that piece of it, because I do think it's important.

772
01:23:57,490 --> 01:24:12,250
I'm trying to get here. I think our last one had a data collection and after about this hard data, um,

773
01:24:14,470 --> 01:24:19,930
this is a fun one because I think this is where your creativity gets to come into play.

774
01:24:20,830 --> 01:24:27,890
I have a very narrow window with which I disseminate most of my work to audiences, and it's three things that.

775
01:24:28,900 --> 01:24:37,090
That's a very, very limited scope and readership and all that through academic journals and whatnot.

776
01:24:37,390 --> 01:24:43,900
So to be thinking about the other ways that you can get your information out there and try to influence impact as many people as possible.

777
01:24:44,890 --> 01:24:46,629
Thinking about how to optimize for it,

778
01:24:46,630 --> 01:24:54,550
that's that's happening that you can recognize you're now good stewards and consumers of information around injury and hopefully around science.

779
01:24:54,850 --> 01:24:59,049
And so know to be sharing that or to be helping folks identify those things.

780
01:24:59,050 --> 01:25:07,900
That's a big part of what I do is people need the work of going out and summarizing the information that's available,

781
01:25:07,900 --> 01:25:11,950
helping to make decisions about what they might be doing or what they might be implementing.

782
01:25:12,400 --> 01:25:15,700
Those are all things that we can do that don't fall under traditional dissemination,

783
01:25:16,780 --> 01:25:23,350
but are still going to be really valuable to the partners that we're working with social media.

784
01:25:24,460 --> 01:25:28,240
Some folks are engaging in social media spaces in some shape or form,

785
01:25:29,320 --> 01:25:37,510
trying to and trying to combat disinformation and trying to highlight things that are working.

786
01:25:38,590 --> 01:25:47,470
How do you navigate those spaces? They're all pieces that are of kind of a newer age of academic dissemination, for lack of a better word.

787
01:25:51,970 --> 01:25:55,050
Yeah. Mm hmm. Yeah.

788
01:25:55,430 --> 01:25:59,500
Um, all right. But it is 1:00. That's all I got for you folks.

789
01:26:00,040 --> 01:26:03,280
I really appreciate your your time and attention this semester.

790
01:26:03,910 --> 01:26:10,480
It's been great to have folks in the room, and I'm always amazed at what you have to say.

791
01:26:11,080 --> 01:26:16,889
And I will say ten years, ten years I've been teaching this class in the public eye yet.

792
01:26:16,890 --> 01:26:23,840
And I swear, this is not a platitude. I have not had a more engaged audience with with guest speakers.

793
01:26:23,860 --> 01:26:30,249
I want you to know that you have been fantastic and it's been uniform across my speakers

794
01:26:30,250 --> 01:26:34,239
that they've said how much they appreciate your questions and attention and all that.

795
01:26:34,240 --> 01:26:38,080
So I really, really appreciate that. I hope you learned something.

796
01:26:38,380 --> 01:26:43,120
I hope you got a chance to to reflect on a new space and maybe consider this as a potential career.

797
01:26:43,750 --> 01:26:51,520
I am around all next semester and would be more than happy to help folks pursue any of these topics in greater depth,

798
01:26:51,520 --> 01:26:58,060
whether that's trying to identify different places on campus where this work is happening to engage in some of their research.

799
01:26:58,330 --> 01:27:04,480
If I have a partner network that would allow you to connect with some people doing this stuff in practice, I will do my absolute best.

800
01:27:04,750 --> 01:27:10,150
We are a small but mighty group or community of injury researchers and injury interest here on campus.

801
01:27:10,450 --> 01:27:14,290
I would encourage you to look at the injury center and the injury prevention certificate.

802
01:27:14,620 --> 01:27:20,920
We have an online look that's focused on injury. We have an online look that's focused on firearm violence prevention.

803
01:27:21,220 --> 01:27:24,940
So lots of resources, a lot of cool work that's happening at the university in this space.

804
01:27:25,240 --> 01:27:27,550
I know some folks are already engaged in it and that's great,

805
01:27:28,090 --> 01:27:33,730
but I'd be happy to help facilitate those connections if that's something you want to do beyond that.

806
01:27:34,000 --> 01:27:40,120
Are there questions or comments? Concerns? I'm figuring you can spend the rest of the time meeting reader groups or I'm happy to hang around chat.

807
01:27:45,490 --> 01:27:49,500
Yeah. Just a little. Yeah.

808
01:27:49,750 --> 01:27:54,370
Have a great have a great break. Good luck with finals and all that kind of good stuff.

809
01:27:54,670 --> 01:27:58,180
And then we'll probably see you in January. Don't forget about your final four.

810
01:27:58,180 --> 01:28:01,430
That's going to go through any Thursday.

811
01:28:01,500 --> 01:28:05,160
Yeah, it's a lot faster than one.

812
01:28:05,440 --> 01:28:08,650
No, no, I can do that. Oh, no.

813
01:28:10,580 --> 01:28:12,830
Oh, listen.
