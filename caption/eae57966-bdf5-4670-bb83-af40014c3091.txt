1
00:00:02,350 --> 00:00:06,840
Operations and then we can talk about that. Oh, yeah, I. I'm pretty sure I'll show you how.

2
00:00:07,890 --> 00:00:14,380
I already got logged on and it's still there, I think. No, no, no.

3
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:19,889
I tried to talk to our candidate, and it was like no words.

4
00:00:19,890 --> 00:00:33,820
Just me appeared idiot. I was like, I know I don't have the rest of my life with this place.

5
00:00:34,070 --> 00:00:44,240
So I go with you. Yeah. Yeah. I really haven't done that yet, but I'm not really herself off the roster.

6
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:52,550
Virtual world away when I like. Copy that. You want to switch it all over again like I don't know what to do.

7
00:00:52,790 --> 00:01:10,730
I'm going to try to reach do that, but I don't know if it's just that deep into an Excel sheet it just I don't even that was like really solid time.

8
00:01:11,960 --> 00:01:23,670
Sure. He's also going to try to get a dissertation, you know?

9
00:01:25,380 --> 00:01:31,110
Yeah, I know. And it's a cool, you know, I'm going to read you want to read a list or something?

10
00:01:31,110 --> 00:01:36,180
I can see that. I don't know what's going to confuse me in a massive open online course.

11
00:01:37,140 --> 00:01:41,910
Something something health system, science or benefit, I think.

12
00:01:43,450 --> 00:01:48,059
What do you have to say?

13
00:01:48,060 --> 00:02:00,510
Like if you don't mind my dissertation, instead of being confined to online training and train of professions,

14
00:02:01,770 --> 00:02:11,400
not understanding yourself, you found a better job.

15
00:02:11,940 --> 00:02:25,020
And all of this is working as well as I would be with a multi year study somewhere through all our talk.

16
00:02:25,110 --> 00:02:29,830
And then I was looking at a problem with nothing.

17
00:02:30,320 --> 00:02:37,170
Nothing. We started the program we started and then I developed it in 2012.

18
00:02:38,010 --> 00:02:48,150
You may if you all if any of you have taken temp six to start our hub help 626 is the one credit six week course that that was that was yours truly.

19
00:02:48,450 --> 00:02:51,779
Oh I made that a long time ago.

20
00:02:51,780 --> 00:02:55,109
It's still there. It's a little bit, a little bit dated.

21
00:02:55,110 --> 00:03:01,889
You might recognize Dr. Davis, and they're going like this and this and this, you know, and it's very, very much in style.

22
00:03:01,890 --> 00:03:07,440
But in I developed it together and it's been that course has been probably seen really, you know,

23
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:15,120
because there was one point that we've estimated around 2000 learners engaged with that material.

24
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:17,110
And so that whole section,

25
00:03:17,430 --> 00:03:25,350
the history of health care reform from the all the perspectives of the US president and that was perhaps the favorite part I think about.

26
00:03:25,890 --> 00:03:30,450
It needs a little work. I'm not involved in this delivery into market test now.

27
00:03:30,450 --> 00:03:33,660
I thought that was fascinating.

28
00:03:33,750 --> 00:03:36,950
We went through and gathered for it.

29
00:03:36,990 --> 00:03:38,810
For those of you get your I am familiar,

30
00:03:38,820 --> 00:03:44,280
but we went through and gathered footage and audio clips and everything you can think of from every presidential library.

31
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:48,810
Only back to President Truman was just incredible to be able to pull out of the archives.

32
00:03:49,230 --> 00:03:56,370
But President Johnson was saying about Medicare passage and hear how different states are approaching this,

33
00:03:56,730 --> 00:04:00,060
it was fascinating thematically is nothing's changed.

34
00:04:00,390 --> 00:04:05,850
It's the same talking point. It's the same talking points we're doing today that we were doing in 1948.

35
00:04:06,930 --> 00:04:14,180
You could argue even back to E.R. Theodore Roosevelt anyway.

36
00:04:14,220 --> 00:04:24,000
But, you know, the morning. Okay, so today, today, we will kick off with current events.

37
00:04:24,750 --> 00:04:28,559
We'll move on to discussion, discussing marketing and communications.

38
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:34,860
We'll take a break from our case presentation, recognizing that the sun sets quite early.

39
00:04:34,860 --> 00:04:41,339
Now, you said even earlier in your speech, I will say we'll see if we can maybe move things along.

40
00:04:41,340 --> 00:04:43,800
So in the end, a little early, if you could try every week.

41
00:04:44,220 --> 00:04:50,670
We all have wonderful presentations and I don't want to cut off the great discussion, so we'll see how we can do.

42
00:04:52,170 --> 00:04:58,860
Questions on Assignment two and a last. We've gone through another continuing argument.

43
00:05:00,180 --> 00:05:07,409
Anything on assignment to watch is due next Tuesday. We aren't extending the deadline.

44
00:05:07,410 --> 00:05:12,250
So. And feel free to come after again.

45
00:05:12,490 --> 00:05:16,250
How much can we? It's really coming out of the ground.

46
00:05:16,750 --> 00:05:21,790
Right. And so some of it's just going to be all right.

47
00:05:22,640 --> 00:05:23,440
It's not quite yet.

48
00:05:23,740 --> 00:05:33,580
But making qualified statements about how much do you want us to draw from, like the actual literature and such and proposing this program?

49
00:05:34,210 --> 00:05:40,510
What do they expect us to say? It will be analyzed by the perspective of who you're writing for.

50
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:45,340
You wouldn't want to make sure that what your demonstrate what you're presenting is

51
00:05:45,340 --> 00:05:49,659
evidence based in some capacity that your audience who's reading this would say,

52
00:05:49,660 --> 00:05:58,570
okay, I get why you've proposed this. So if it's something that is not really validated in any way or has no track record.

53
00:05:59,170 --> 00:06:03,460
If I'm the decision maker and I'm looking at it, what do you think my first question might be?

54
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:10,920
Well, where did you find so where? But what else would you do?

55
00:06:12,100 --> 00:06:19,960
Okay. And what else? But on other questions. Yeah, a little work and I follow up on that.

56
00:06:20,770 --> 00:06:24,990
So that hasn't been done before you go. And are you going to say something then?

57
00:06:25,150 --> 00:06:30,219
Yeah. So if I'm in charge and I got this and you turn it into me and you said, yeah, let's do this.

58
00:06:30,220 --> 00:06:35,520
And those are likely the questions have been asked. So I've got no science, I've got no examples of it being done.

59
00:06:35,530 --> 00:06:39,230
I've got no other evidence. You know, I'm going to go.

60
00:06:39,470 --> 00:06:44,170
Okay, that's nice. But that plus the other 25 of these I'm looking at.

61
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:47,899
Why should I pick yours? Now, remember, organizationally,

62
00:06:47,900 --> 00:06:57,799
managers and leaders inside organizations don't necessarily rely on formal literature based citations to justify very often organization.

63
00:06:57,800 --> 00:07:03,110
They make decisions to proceed based on a track record or results that that they can see.

64
00:07:03,980 --> 00:07:07,660
And that's common. So I don't want to suggest that, you know,

65
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:13,130
it's only based on what you see demonstrated in the literature is oftentimes programs are not

66
00:07:13,670 --> 00:07:18,110
necessarily and sometimes innovative programs having undergone that kind of rigorous evaluation.

67
00:07:18,980 --> 00:07:22,040
But nonetheless, it should have some grounding in why you're choosing.

68
00:07:23,590 --> 00:07:35,320
Yes. So it's not that expanding like an existing program would say, yes, you can be expanding, but it needs to be substantively new.

69
00:07:35,330 --> 00:07:42,760
So here's how I put it. I like to put it. I'd like to add two more sites to this existing program.

70
00:07:42,780 --> 00:07:46,950
That's not new. That's just expanding to more sites as something is already done.

71
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:53,800
I'd like to add a division of this program that currently serves children and like now serve elderly the elderly community.

72
00:07:53,820 --> 00:07:56,730
That's new. That's how I would make the distinction.

73
00:07:57,720 --> 00:08:01,920
Because otherwise, if you're just adding to more sites, there's not much creativity to what you're proposing.

74
00:08:02,850 --> 00:08:10,210
Scaling something. It's not the same. How are we doing on this?

75
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:14,110
Have we had any good ideas? Anyone want to share kind of what they're. What they're working on?

76
00:08:18,410 --> 00:08:21,530
This is a this is an idea. But I just I just had like more of a question about it.

77
00:08:21,890 --> 00:08:31,969
So with mine, Ronald McDonald House, like, I think it might just be like they're only allowed to do specific things like every site or chapter.

78
00:08:31,970 --> 00:08:41,240
That's what's called. They only have like, you know, the actual house, the care mobile, like the mobile clinic or the family room.

79
00:08:41,480 --> 00:08:50,240
And so like mine already has those things. So like, I don't think that they, I don't see allowed, but like it's just, I guess it's not within them.

80
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:55,880
So like, could I suggest maybe like a volunteer type of thing or like I guess, I don't know.

81
00:08:56,360 --> 00:09:02,960
So you could suggest that or you could write a little bit about in your section about the board, we have to build board support for the program.

82
00:09:03,320 --> 00:09:05,270
You can talk about, you know, hey, this is new.

83
00:09:05,270 --> 00:09:11,120
I recognize that we're going to need to get a resolution passed or amend the bylaws, you know, think through.

84
00:09:11,170 --> 00:09:17,450
I want again with every assignment in our course. I want you to think about it as if you are there in the organization.

85
00:09:17,450 --> 00:09:23,870
If you have an idea and you want to do something about it, you just have to think about how am I going to get this accomplished.

86
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:31,129
So it's, it's, it's in many ways, I guess the leadership skills I'm trying to impart on all of you is the tactical part,

87
00:09:31,130 --> 00:09:35,420
the strategy part B, I have something I want to do and how am I going to get it done?

88
00:09:35,770 --> 00:09:42,290
Um, you know, I like to think that in some ways we can liken it to sort of the legislative process.

89
00:09:42,920 --> 00:09:50,420
For those of you who are in here, we're pursuing an MPH or maybe, you know, it's great to introduce a bill,

90
00:09:50,870 --> 00:09:56,029
but if it doesn't have the votes and it doesn't have anywhere to go for it to go, it just is just goes into a drawer.

91
00:09:56,030 --> 00:09:57,020
And so it comes up.

92
00:09:57,470 --> 00:10:04,610
But very often they're introducing the bill to gain momentum so that when they do have the votes, eventually they're ready to go with it.

93
00:10:05,150 --> 00:10:08,210
So it has to have a path, some effort to go somewhere.

94
00:10:08,540 --> 00:10:11,899
Otherwise it's just kind of a dead end. But think about it.

95
00:10:11,900 --> 00:10:16,850
You know, think about what your path is. If it's something that you're introducing that's different, you know, that's fine.

96
00:10:21,310 --> 00:10:27,750
I just wanted to clarify because if I think, like, we're going to be drawing off our previous assignment, right?

97
00:10:27,790 --> 00:10:38,890
Sure. So in one of your comments, you mentioned I needed to clarify more about any conflicts of interest.

98
00:10:39,110 --> 00:10:42,540
Like where would we find so we're going.

99
00:10:42,610 --> 00:10:48,580
I look for that. Sure. So conflicts of interest and this was a comment that I think many of you probably got on on the assignment.

100
00:10:50,500 --> 00:10:52,630
I want let's be clear what it means.

101
00:10:52,870 --> 00:11:03,249
A conflict of interest means it's someone in the organization has some knowledge or intelligence or knowhow or connection with something

102
00:11:03,250 --> 00:11:13,390
else that the organization is doing that makes that person unable to discharge their duty in a forthright or objective fashion.

103
00:11:13,870 --> 00:11:22,690
That does not mean that they are nefarious or that they are looking to try and curry favor or get get, you know,

104
00:11:22,930 --> 00:11:27,219
so that the case we did on the Kidney Foundation where we were looking at it, you know,

105
00:11:27,220 --> 00:11:32,530
in a situation where they were really misusing their power, they're misusing their authority.

106
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:39,160
That's a case where there was a conflict of interest and then the ethical problem took place.

107
00:11:39,550 --> 00:11:43,990
So having a conflict of interest does not mean that the person is, you know,

108
00:11:44,740 --> 00:11:48,970
ineligible to be part of the organization or somehow doing something that's unethical.

109
00:11:49,570 --> 00:11:56,470
What it means is, is that they have a conflict of interest. They need to disclose it, and then they need to then manage the conflict.

110
00:11:56,950 --> 00:12:00,280
So back to the question you asked specifically.

111
00:12:01,180 --> 00:12:03,250
How do we know if it's a conflict of interest?

112
00:12:03,290 --> 00:12:08,440
Well, very often you don't know unless you're in the organization, unless you sort of your way around it, there's ways you can look.

113
00:12:08,980 --> 00:12:12,580
So the board members have particular affiliations.

114
00:12:12,580 --> 00:12:16,810
You know, are they part of companies that potentially could be suppliers to the organization?

115
00:12:17,500 --> 00:12:23,260
Sometimes you might have a board member who's a developer. You know, they they build they do they do a building.

116
00:12:23,710 --> 00:12:26,890
And you've got an organization that's going to build a new facility.

117
00:12:27,310 --> 00:12:31,690
Well, naturally, they want to go to that board member and say, hey, you want to build our facility?

118
00:12:32,110 --> 00:12:36,610
Well, now that board member has a vote on the board to decide whether or not the

119
00:12:36,610 --> 00:12:40,720
facility is going to get built with the company that that person is representing.

120
00:12:41,650 --> 00:12:43,150
And now that's a conflict of interest.

121
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:50,139
So what we would typically see is that that board member would need to recuse themselves from the process and beyond that,

122
00:12:50,140 --> 00:12:56,890
have some management around it. You know, other board members should know not to discuss this arrangement with this person.

123
00:12:57,280 --> 00:13:03,550
You know, the the executive team should know that they can't negotiate the contract directly with that board member.

124
00:13:03,880 --> 00:13:07,660
They need some third party that they're negotiating with. So other ways to kind of manage it.

125
00:13:07,990 --> 00:13:16,720
But it's very much different than a conflict where we see that there's problems or somehow, you know, people at odds with one another.

126
00:13:16,990 --> 00:13:28,750
That's different than a conflict of interest. Anyone here want a name, some conflicts of interest that they've seen in the world.

127
00:13:29,110 --> 00:13:36,280
Christiana One of the people on the board of my organization, which is like an advocacy organization, is an elected office.

128
00:13:36,670 --> 00:13:40,840
So I said that that was one. And why is it a conflict of interest?

129
00:13:42,610 --> 00:13:46,990
They can be pushing towards bills or policies that they want to push for.

130
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:50,350
Uh, that was one thing I thought of,

131
00:13:50,350 --> 00:13:58,719
and I think another conflict may be of interest for that person is perhaps they might have donors that are similar,

132
00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:02,580
meaning donors to the organic same donors to their campaigns.

133
00:14:02,590 --> 00:14:04,670
And now it's hard for them to sort of, you know,

134
00:14:04,750 --> 00:14:09,520
if the organization is going to do something that's not going to be pleasing to the donors, to the organization.

135
00:14:09,550 --> 00:14:14,350
Now, there's a board member going to go, well, I better not support that because then those folks won't be happy with me.

136
00:14:14,680 --> 00:14:27,670
So now it's a conflict of interest. Go ahead. Oh, I have an organization that is sheltering unaccompanied minors for a living and they,

137
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:38,090
rather than own their facilities, rent their facilities from the president of the organization who owns the facilities.

138
00:14:38,110 --> 00:14:42,820
Okay. So this is that's a great example. So the president of the organization owns the facilities.

139
00:14:43,270 --> 00:14:47,020
They they stand to benefit financially from that rental.

140
00:14:47,470 --> 00:14:51,100
Again, that conflict of interest is what needs to be managed.

141
00:14:51,550 --> 00:14:56,320
If there's evidence of a management plan or there's some idea of how they're handling it,

142
00:14:56,710 --> 00:15:04,210
most likely that's fine for the organization and that's how they'll handle it, because think about it from the organization's interest.

143
00:15:04,630 --> 00:15:07,750
Do they want to give up the opportunity to get a discounted rental?

144
00:15:07,750 --> 00:15:11,610
You know, if this is the only game in town, but there needs to be a process,

145
00:15:11,620 --> 00:15:18,340
there has to be a do fair process where they can evaluate it openly, where they can bid on it if they need to.

146
00:15:18,530 --> 00:15:21,700
You know, where there's not coercion or pressure from the president to say,

147
00:15:21,940 --> 00:15:26,850
you have to use me or I'm going to have it, there'll be a negative outcome for your organization.

148
00:15:26,970 --> 00:15:31,330
So very, very commonly that that that's what you'll see.

149
00:15:31,780 --> 00:15:37,509
But that's most certainly that would be if I was in a governance session with that board at you all

150
00:15:37,510 --> 00:15:43,059
would be followed by for that when you're finished with our course to be able to ask those questions,

151
00:15:43,060 --> 00:15:46,390
that would be a reasonable question. What's the you know, what's the management plan here?

152
00:15:46,420 --> 00:15:53,980
How are you handling this relationship? Others other questions.

153
00:15:55,210 --> 00:16:00,130
Great many. Okay.

154
00:16:01,190 --> 00:16:05,450
All right. Next Tuesday, midnight. It's going to be great.

155
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:11,060
You should do. Happening. And I know it's the election next Tuesday, too, so.

156
00:16:12,770 --> 00:16:16,160
Yeah. Okay. I'm not going to say anymore.

157
00:16:16,700 --> 00:16:20,270
All right. So current events.

158
00:16:20,300 --> 00:16:23,710
Who wants to go first? Can see. Right? All right.

159
00:16:28,270 --> 00:16:33,710
Going to do you just let me know.

160
00:16:36,020 --> 00:16:40,040
It's like, you know, I mean, all in all, automate.

161
00:16:40,040 --> 00:16:53,420
Is it automated? The next slide will be a little question and answer as a computer commentary, you know?

162
00:16:53,570 --> 00:17:01,129
Hi, guys. So my topic today is the banning of books and censorship on books in schools,

163
00:17:01,130 --> 00:17:05,330
which has been kind of a hot topic over the past couple of years and particularly in the past year.

164
00:17:07,430 --> 00:17:15,650
So we're going to start out by doing a little Q&A with some trivia of kind of misconceptions or true facts about book fans.

165
00:17:16,730 --> 00:17:19,870
You can get in. Okay.

166
00:17:19,870 --> 00:17:25,120
So true or false sometimes to ban books in the United States first in 2021 to the

167
00:17:25,120 --> 00:17:29,200
highest level since the American Library Association began tracking this 20 years ago.

168
00:17:30,580 --> 00:17:37,110
Do you think true? False. Very true.

169
00:17:37,530 --> 00:17:43,270
Great. I'll get to a stat of what the numbers were over the past year.

170
00:17:43,290 --> 00:17:47,579
A little bit later. But the gist of it is that over the past year,

171
00:17:47,580 --> 00:17:54,600
there's been more than I've seen in any previous year with lots of different

172
00:17:54,600 --> 00:17:59,220
organizations popping up in a rising to really promote the banning of these books.

173
00:18:00,510 --> 00:18:12,299
Next one. So top books that are banned are classics like To Kill a mockingbird and Huck Finn To Your Boss, Lazy Boat.

174
00:18:12,300 --> 00:18:16,260
There's falls as well. I would do it. Should we click it? Yes.

175
00:18:18,390 --> 00:18:21,930
These are some of the books that have been banned in certain areas.

176
00:18:21,930 --> 00:18:26,700
So it's not that they aren't the most popular. They aren't being banned, but they're not the most popular.

177
00:18:27,240 --> 00:18:35,220
The ones that are most targeted are those that either are written by or have protagonists and main,

178
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:41,160
main or supporting characters that are people of other color or LGBTQ people.

179
00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:51,310
So next one. Do people support banning books or not in the majority?

180
00:18:52,390 --> 00:18:57,130
True. Plus.

181
00:18:57,690 --> 00:19:03,060
Yes, the majority of Americans actually do not support the banning of books kind of globally.

182
00:19:04,290 --> 00:19:15,239
And there's a lot of misconceptions around that. There was a stat that the majority of voters strongly oppose book banning,

183
00:19:15,240 --> 00:19:20,760
and 75% of voters said that they will consider book bans when voting for legislation in November.

184
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:23,040
And this was a study from earlier this year.

185
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:31,980
So a topic that's kind of very interesting, especially to people who have kids in schools or are students themselves.

186
00:19:33,450 --> 00:19:37,870
Next one, police reports have been filed against library staff.

187
00:19:40,650 --> 00:19:46,950
You know, and so there has been lots of threats by politicians,

188
00:19:46,950 --> 00:19:53,889
community members to local libraries, and they threatened to kind of pull their funding.

189
00:19:53,890 --> 00:19:59,549
And if people don't ban certain books and there have also been, um, specifically,

190
00:19:59,550 --> 00:20:04,830
I think they said there are at least 27 instances of police reports being filed

191
00:20:04,830 --> 00:20:09,090
against library staff over the content on their shelves in the past year.

192
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:23,180
And then lastly, so this might be something we all know, but Florida was limiting teaching on race and racism in their schools.

193
00:20:24,350 --> 00:20:32,170
True. True. So there have been a lot of fights over the past year in many different places.

194
00:20:32,180 --> 00:20:40,070
Florida being one of the major ones that we've probably all heard about with the lovely Governor DeSantis,

195
00:20:41,360 --> 00:20:47,780
saying that our school system is for educating kids and not indoctrinating kids by pushing liberal ideology.

196
00:20:49,130 --> 00:20:59,780
And there have been various types of bans on different kind of focusing on different groups that they're eliminating books from in schools.

197
00:20:59,810 --> 00:21:03,470
In Florida, there is the one that's focused on race.

198
00:21:03,480 --> 00:21:12,770
There's one that is going to discriminate against sexual orientation and gender identity, not being able to talk about this in K through third grade.

199
00:21:13,970 --> 00:21:22,370
There are there's also one that says if students identify themselves with specific pronouns in school,

200
00:21:22,370 --> 00:21:26,030
that people are required to report that to their parents so that they know.

201
00:21:26,600 --> 00:21:34,330
So a lot of issues, discrimination, fear mongering and like a lot of different things going on with this.

202
00:21:34,910 --> 00:21:37,310
And so you can go to the next slide.

203
00:21:37,640 --> 00:21:46,430
This is an example of the top ten books of the titles that have been most frequently cited and required to be banned.

204
00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:58,220
So you can see some things there. So what our book bans, these are actions against books based on their content,

205
00:21:59,120 --> 00:22:09,170
typically a result of parent and community challenges to either schools, libraries, school libraries, classrooms.

206
00:22:09,470 --> 00:22:13,670
It kind of vary in where the books are and how they're banned.

207
00:22:14,090 --> 00:22:17,840
If these are permanent restrictions, if they're temporary restrictions.

208
00:22:18,950 --> 00:22:25,429
But really, it's kind of going against the folks who have identified that certain books are there to promote

209
00:22:25,430 --> 00:22:30,560
education and learning of individuals either in the classroom or in the school libraries.

210
00:22:32,360 --> 00:22:36,050
So a lot of bans going on throughout the United States.

211
00:22:37,250 --> 00:22:46,010
You can go to the next slide. So this is kind of the spread of different types of ban that have occurred over the past year.

212
00:22:47,180 --> 00:22:51,169
As you can see, the majority or the largest portion are in classrooms.

213
00:22:51,170 --> 00:22:58,110
And then there's a huge number of fans that are pending investigation for the next one.

214
00:22:58,130 --> 00:23:03,140
So this is kind of getting back to what are the topics that are being banned most frequently.

215
00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:08,870
As you can see here, the majority are against LGBTQ themes,

216
00:23:09,980 --> 00:23:18,320
books that have individuals of color as a primary or secondary characters, sexual content and etc.

217
00:23:18,320 --> 00:23:26,270
Going down the list here. There is something that I found interesting that they don't have a category against violence.

218
00:23:26,930 --> 00:23:31,549
Fans are more interested in your racing identities and experiences of queer people and people of color.

219
00:23:31,550 --> 00:23:44,810
But violence is not a strongly focused on topic of books that people feel are something they have to keep out of schools or the hands of young adults.

220
00:23:46,030 --> 00:23:49,360
Are the ones on the right aisle books that have been banned at some point.

221
00:23:51,910 --> 00:23:58,090
Yeah. They really read the comic. So I would just point out not to interrupt you at this point.

222
00:23:58,090 --> 00:24:01,920
It's interesting how it's it's also based on a time period.

223
00:24:01,930 --> 00:24:05,649
So like the Pentagon Papers was, I assume,

224
00:24:05,650 --> 00:24:14,830
a book related to in the 1970s when those were leaked out of out of context during the war in Vietnam versus,

225
00:24:14,830 --> 00:24:19,780
you know, some of these others that are more related topics realistic.

226
00:24:19,960 --> 00:24:22,300
It's interesting to see the different. Yeah.

227
00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:30,459
And I mean, it kind of also shows that like as we see, the majority of the topics are around kind of identities of individuals,

228
00:24:30,460 --> 00:24:37,750
but there's also a movement to keep out a lot of stories revolving around like our

229
00:24:37,750 --> 00:24:43,810
own histories and wanting to protect people from having to essentially confront,

230
00:24:43,960 --> 00:24:49,410
confront the atrocities that we have caused harm within our own histories in the U.S.

231
00:24:50,680 --> 00:24:53,940
So a lot of really interesting and complex.

232
00:24:53,950 --> 00:25:00,130
I have experience. Go to the next slide. So this just shows a little bit of the distribution of the bans.

233
00:25:00,550 --> 00:25:08,980
Probably unsurprising, but the majority and kind of the South and the Rust Belt with the top two states being Texas and Florida.

234
00:25:10,390 --> 00:25:13,760
Um. And then you can go to the next slide.

235
00:25:14,510 --> 00:25:24,500
So why this is important? There isn't a ton of like hard stats and research on showing what a true detriment

236
00:25:24,650 --> 00:25:30,020
to this is and the negative impacts to kids and really to our communities.

237
00:25:30,020 --> 00:25:39,770
But we can kind of make extrapolations and you can see here the significant impact it has with over 2000 books being banned in the past year,

238
00:25:39,980 --> 00:25:49,370
impacting over 4 million students. The with this growth in this movement over the past couple of years,

239
00:25:49,760 --> 00:25:58,190
there is a bunch of different organizations that are kind of leading the cause and really voicing all of these arguments against books.

240
00:25:58,820 --> 00:26:06,410
And 70% of organizations that are kind of leading this have been formed since 2021.

241
00:26:06,620 --> 00:26:17,479
That was really fascinating. And as I mentioned, it's not just like parents and people going to school boards, which does happen,

242
00:26:17,480 --> 00:26:24,410
but there's also a ton of legislation, bills, gag orders, which is a interesting phrase to me.

243
00:26:24,440 --> 00:26:33,799
But anyways, that's what they use. And there's a lot of these going on that really focus on kind of divisive and

244
00:26:33,800 --> 00:26:40,310
obscene as kind of their key highlights of why topics are supposed to be banned.

245
00:26:41,240 --> 00:26:47,600
They also use parents rights as a way to advocate for this and that parents need

246
00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:51,889
to know what people are being taught and what's going on in the classroom.

247
00:26:51,890 --> 00:26:57,650
And that was actually like a phrasing that Sanchez used in his arguments for

248
00:26:57,650 --> 00:27:02,330
why students need to or like why they need to be sheltered in certain ways,

249
00:27:02,330 --> 00:27:08,809
and that parents are here to oversee everything. And then again,

250
00:27:08,810 --> 00:27:15,590
like a lot of what the consequences of this are is that it really limits the complexity of

251
00:27:15,590 --> 00:27:21,080
thought and kind of challenging of thought in classrooms or in conversations of individuals.

252
00:27:21,890 --> 00:27:26,180
We see a lot of discrimination, as you can see, with the types of books that are being banned,

253
00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:33,710
limiting perspectives and open mindedness of students and limits limiting on freedom of speech.

254
00:27:34,910 --> 00:27:42,860
And I think like this quote down here, the bans was a dangerous precedent to those in and out of schools intersecting with other movements

255
00:27:42,860 --> 00:27:47,780
to block or curtail that offensive advances in civil rights for historically marginalized people.

256
00:27:48,470 --> 00:27:52,940
I think it just shows like the slippery slope that we can be on with this and how they're

257
00:27:53,240 --> 00:27:59,090
framing so much momentum and traction that I think it's going down a dangerous path.

258
00:28:01,320 --> 00:28:11,070
So getting to the nonprofit that I've put focus on for this PEN, America is the nonprofit that I've chosen.

259
00:28:11,100 --> 00:28:24,330
You can go to the next slide. So this is an organization that has international ties, but there's a specific Pan America kind of focus within it.

260
00:28:24,810 --> 00:28:30,000
And they have been around for 100 years this year, since 1922.

261
00:28:31,230 --> 00:28:37,830
It's the PEN. America specifically is the largest of more than 100 centers worldwide that make up PEN International.

262
00:28:39,060 --> 00:28:49,080
And they are a5a1c3 nonprofit headquartered in New York City with seven chapters regionally around the country.

263
00:28:50,220 --> 00:28:58,920
So they focus on intersection of literature and human rights to protect free expression in the United States and worldwide.

264
00:28:59,700 --> 00:29:04,830
They champion the freedom to write, recognizing the power of the word to transform the world.

265
00:29:05,430 --> 00:29:11,940
And their mission is to unite writers and their allies, to celebrate freedom of expression and defend the liberties that make it possible.

266
00:29:14,580 --> 00:29:18,030
So they have a lot of different kind of things they do.

267
00:29:18,550 --> 00:29:23,940
And the U.S. branch really focuses on a few things in particular.

268
00:29:24,450 --> 00:29:33,509
They have over 7500 members. A lot of their members and kind of folks that are really involved in this are a lot of officers.

269
00:29:33,510 --> 00:29:40,050
And they work hand-in-hand with community members as well as literary scholars.

270
00:29:41,040 --> 00:29:48,120
And they have lots of chapters, chapters focused on mobilizing through public programing and campaigning,

271
00:29:48,600 --> 00:29:52,050
literary events, workshops, civic forums and other projects.

272
00:29:52,620 --> 00:29:57,970
And their main kind of focuses. Here are the two that I have on the left here,

273
00:29:57,990 --> 00:30:05,069
the free expression programs that are kind of focused on this topic of banning books and

274
00:30:05,070 --> 00:30:10,440
defending the rights and writers and journalists and protecting the rights of free expression.

275
00:30:10,920 --> 00:30:15,520
They do lots of research and reports as well as advocacy and campaigns.

276
00:30:16,110 --> 00:30:20,730
And then they have their kind of more literary programing.

277
00:30:20,760 --> 00:30:30,300
They host a lot of festivals. They do a lot of awards, galas, kind of public programing to amplify the voices of literary works and.

278
00:30:31,460 --> 00:30:36,350
So that brings me to my questions here for you guys.

279
00:30:37,130 --> 00:30:46,630
The first question is just kind of an open discussion on your thoughts about banning books in schools, especially,

280
00:30:46,640 --> 00:30:54,740
kind of I thought this off of last week and the misinformation and thinking about how media can impact this.

281
00:30:56,030 --> 00:31:07,600
But what do you guys think? Is there any role for it?

282
00:31:08,350 --> 00:31:08,950
Yeah, actually,

283
00:31:08,950 --> 00:31:13,780
I want to do something because I actually want to hear what people think about it just because this is actually happening in Dearborn right now.

284
00:31:14,080 --> 00:31:23,370
Was it a lot of argument to the school board because the city is trying to ban books, Facebook, LGBTQ books,

285
00:31:23,380 --> 00:31:29,920
all books on that like go into explicit detail about any sort of like sexual conduct, I guess.

286
00:31:30,100 --> 00:31:36,040
And so there are always argument is like it's like a religious from a religious point of view, they don't want to expose their kids.

287
00:31:36,340 --> 00:31:41,830
And I would always say, like, what? I mean, who's supporting is this going through the city council?

288
00:31:42,220 --> 00:31:47,660
At first they all took it to say, Oh, like the community members.

289
00:31:47,950 --> 00:31:52,360
Yeah. So first it went towards Abdullah Hammoud and he was like, I'm not going to censor books.

290
00:31:52,720 --> 00:31:56,920
And he basically just redirects people like go to your school board and talk about it there.

291
00:31:58,540 --> 00:32:03,250
But yeah, so people that's that's like community members arguments and then like,

292
00:32:03,340 --> 00:32:08,080
people like me are just like, well, your kids can access this sort of stuff, like on your computer.

293
00:32:08,290 --> 00:32:12,940
And they would say, Well, just because we can't fix one thing doesn't mean we shouldn't fix the other thing.

294
00:32:13,240 --> 00:32:19,090
The books like so, like, just because my kids get it online doesn't mean that I should allow them to see the actual books.

295
00:32:19,360 --> 00:32:23,319
So know if anyone has, like, anything that I can say. Back to that, I guess.

296
00:32:23,320 --> 00:32:26,560
Well, first of all, you can set up my dad did this.

297
00:32:26,590 --> 00:32:30,290
This is what he set up, really heavy Internet restrictions.

298
00:32:30,430 --> 00:32:33,550
I'm saying I can't control the Internet. It's a it's a lifeline.

299
00:32:34,850 --> 00:32:42,129
And then that's my first statement. I don't. But I guess there's like they can control the Internet at home, maybe.

300
00:32:42,130 --> 00:32:48,300
But that doesn't mean that they can't access that school or other places. I know schools have their own ways of preventing that as well.

301
00:32:48,310 --> 00:32:54,670
But just logically, let's send our kids who have never heard of these topics important to the world.

302
00:32:56,010 --> 00:33:00,160
Books are great way to like experience those things before having to actually physically go.

303
00:33:02,830 --> 00:33:04,980
Because I was actually chatting with, um,

304
00:33:05,680 --> 00:33:12,520
I met she's the president of one of the something and at a Detroit school and you're like where you line for a rally.

305
00:33:12,520 --> 00:33:15,790
And she was just chatting about it and she was saying that.

306
00:33:17,900 --> 00:33:24,850
Like she was as like she because she's a teacher and she just like pulled up a government website and there was like this porn ad on it.

307
00:33:24,860 --> 00:33:30,860
So she's like, she's saying she's like, any website you go to, there's like something that's explicit, so you really can't monitor it.

308
00:33:30,860 --> 00:33:32,540
So I don't know what people are expecting out with the books.

309
00:33:32,540 --> 00:33:37,040
But anyway, the arguments always, if I can do something to moderate books that can do something to monitor the Internet,

310
00:33:37,340 --> 00:33:40,969
I just never know how to like have an actual conversation about it.

311
00:33:40,970 --> 00:33:45,010
So I don't know. Yeah. I guess for me, it's like.

312
00:33:46,750 --> 00:33:51,920
The conversation there is like centering around banning books when the conversation shouldn't be around like.

313
00:33:53,310 --> 00:33:58,320
What can you do as a parent to ensure that your children understand these

314
00:33:58,320 --> 00:34:03,390
topics and that you will not allow them to have these books or do these things?

315
00:34:03,750 --> 00:34:08,790
Because there's also parents out there going back to the parents rights that you talked about or parents out there that are like,

316
00:34:08,790 --> 00:34:12,180
I want my kids to read these books and I want my kids to see these things.

317
00:34:12,750 --> 00:34:18,840
And that's what I want my middle school to read, like the most vulgar sexual things in the world.

318
00:34:19,210 --> 00:34:20,580
So that's not what most of these books are.

319
00:34:20,660 --> 00:34:28,430
I read most of these folks in high school like To Kill a mockingbird, and I don't know, I'm on Patton America's website.

320
00:34:28,440 --> 00:34:31,470
And it's like these like of Mice and Men.

321
00:34:33,200 --> 00:34:39,590
I mean, even like The Handmaid's Tale, like Kite Runner, all these I've read a big run of The Kite Runner.

322
00:34:40,040 --> 00:34:45,140
Like, I've read a lot of these books already. And, like, these books didn't, like, mess me up.

323
00:34:45,360 --> 00:34:49,849
They they taught me about what the world is actually presenting.

324
00:34:49,850 --> 00:34:53,300
And so, like, books are doing anything. It's not indoctrinating kids.

325
00:34:53,310 --> 00:34:57,480
It's like teaching them world action. It's true. I agree.

326
00:34:57,590 --> 00:35:02,299
You have to kind of like keep in mind, like, how much of it is actually harming students?

327
00:35:02,300 --> 00:35:09,800
And it's just like, yeah, banning these books is actually doing them more good than harm or more harm than good.

328
00:35:09,890 --> 00:35:13,100
Yeah. Which I think is probably something we can all agree on.

329
00:35:13,100 --> 00:35:16,220
Right. Like they're limiting this again, like you were saying.

330
00:35:16,640 --> 00:35:22,240
And there's data and people saying that like this doesn't actually prevent people from accessing the books, right?

331
00:35:22,280 --> 00:35:24,800
People get them online or from other places.

332
00:35:26,360 --> 00:35:31,730
Although there was an argument that people were like, Oh, people can just go get at the library if they really want it.

333
00:35:32,660 --> 00:35:39,430
Access to the libraries is like pretty limited in a lot of areas and a lot of libraries won't have a lot of books that people want.

334
00:35:39,440 --> 00:35:44,509
So it's, you know, I think having access on the Internet can be helpful, but there's a lot of issues.

335
00:35:44,510 --> 00:35:53,089
So there's like one case for potentially banned books would be like books like Mein Kampf or like books that like I mean,

336
00:35:53,090 --> 00:35:56,149
it's like a similar argument to like free speech type of stuff.

337
00:35:56,150 --> 00:36:00,500
Like, you know, the ACLU will defend like.

338
00:36:01,780 --> 00:36:09,190
Nazi groups because they want free speech. So it's kind of a something you can sort of question for banning books and sort of similar.

339
00:36:09,880 --> 00:36:11,770
Like if we're going to say no banning drugs,

340
00:36:11,770 --> 00:36:19,720
then we do have to allow for potentially allow for books like that have like really radical ideologies in the opposite direction.

341
00:36:20,240 --> 00:36:29,170
I mean, David and then Martin, I think that reading books looks like a good way of meeting them a little bit like what is happening in the world,

342
00:36:29,170 --> 00:36:36,220
because a lot of time, even though these stories are fiction, there is some more just some more inspired by like the real events.

343
00:36:36,520 --> 00:36:42,550
So as much as we want our world to be perfect, it is not a perfect world and certain things do happen.

344
00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:48,610
So I feel reading through that through a fictional story, but generally has like a good ending.

345
00:36:48,610 --> 00:36:54,579
It's a good way of, you know, exposing kids to the life cycle of how things happen.

346
00:36:54,580 --> 00:37:02,319
Things do not happen, how you deal with it. I think it makes them sort of like it expands their thoughts,

347
00:37:02,320 --> 00:37:09,070
like they are prepared to see the things that happen in the world, which we began on good things.

348
00:37:09,070 --> 00:37:14,290
But then how you deal with them. Yeah. And the majority of books that are banned are nonfiction.

349
00:37:14,290 --> 00:37:20,440
And there's I think it's probably like around 60 or something percent are nonfiction to fiction.

350
00:37:21,020 --> 00:37:27,570
DAVIES Comment and I want to pose a second question about that concludes I know that every school district is different.

351
00:37:27,610 --> 00:37:32,590
Looks like what's a part of their curriculum and what books are taught at certain grade levels.

352
00:37:32,890 --> 00:37:38,440
I think it's important to like have that distinction between like what's available in the schools library.

353
00:37:38,710 --> 00:37:43,080
Like what's a part of the curriculum that's actually being taught in class and just like

354
00:37:43,090 --> 00:37:48,290
influencing like age restrictions or limits instead of just like banning the books altogether,

355
00:37:48,290 --> 00:37:55,210
right? It's a difference between like reading Lord of the Flies and like, you know, ten years old versus me at 16 when I was in 10th grade.

356
00:37:55,220 --> 00:37:58,750
Right. So, yeah, that's a great point.

357
00:38:00,350 --> 00:38:08,260
So just before you just want to just from an organizational perspective, because I think your second question speaks to this.

358
00:38:08,270 --> 00:38:14,620
You know, if we're thinking about pattern in some of these other nonprofits. Part of me wonders what goes on.

359
00:38:14,620 --> 00:38:18,740
And these would be the same type of discussion we had last week I think was pretty.

360
00:38:18,760 --> 00:38:24,010
Was that your presentation about news? Yeah. So so it's the same question.

361
00:38:24,020 --> 00:38:31,490
If the organization is coming into a community where these kinds of laws and policies are popular,

362
00:38:31,820 --> 00:38:38,480
if they're coming from New York, from a place where maybe the support for that is less or much less so.

363
00:38:38,930 --> 00:38:44,100
What's the channel in the organization? How are they getting this through?

364
00:38:44,120 --> 00:38:51,470
Or is it just sort of cementing this in communities where it is supportive to not ban,

365
00:38:51,920 --> 00:38:56,840
but then kind of lost and those that are not because it's the organizations.

366
00:38:56,840 --> 00:39:05,600
I mean, absent a law and as we saw with obvious presentation about Diwali, if the law's unenforceable is not going to anything.

367
00:39:05,930 --> 00:39:09,830
So it's interesting, as I was asking about the different book titles.

368
00:39:11,500 --> 00:39:18,160
Years ago. Huckleberry Finn and To Kill a mockingbird were very often the first ones that were on the ban.

369
00:39:19,900 --> 00:39:23,230
Now that's dropped down by the Pentagon Papers.

370
00:39:23,260 --> 00:39:26,590
I mean, raise your hand if you are familiar with that and know.

371
00:39:26,740 --> 00:39:30,250
Okay. Mark, what was the Pentagon Papers? Well, like you were saying before,

372
00:39:30,250 --> 00:39:38,110
it was documents from the Pentagon that kind of detailed the U.S. government's knowledge of atrocities in Vietnam that was not released to the public.

373
00:39:38,530 --> 00:39:44,980
Okay. So if anybody hearing about that these days. No. So that's not it's not really on the top of anyone's list, so to speak.

374
00:39:45,460 --> 00:39:50,350
So it's interesting to see, you know, and I guess the reason I bring all that up is to say to your second question,

375
00:39:50,650 --> 00:39:56,290
as an organizational leader, as someone who is responsible for trying to address this, what is there to do?

376
00:39:57,640 --> 00:40:06,280
So building on what you wrote to me. Yeah, I think it was at the Brooklyn Library that this where they basically said,

377
00:40:07,150 --> 00:40:11,770
you can get a library card if you are from one of the states that has all these bad books,

378
00:40:12,460 --> 00:40:18,190
you can get a library card at the Brooklyn Library and you can rent books you want from us.

379
00:40:18,730 --> 00:40:22,209
I think that is like a great way of showing what's right now.

380
00:40:22,210 --> 00:40:28,570
I think like Texas or something, trying to counter law that somehow that's not how it works.

381
00:40:29,180 --> 00:40:36,580
Anyway, I think that doing something like that where like a nonprofit is trying to go and maybe it's not like necessarily going into a community,

382
00:40:36,850 --> 00:40:43,809
but like offering these services to members that are in those communities to get them

383
00:40:43,810 --> 00:40:48,520
these books that they want to read that ah and maybe that comes with age limits like,

384
00:40:48,820 --> 00:40:53,770
you know, putting the books and. I don't know.

385
00:40:53,780 --> 00:40:56,930
I think just coming from an outsider perspective into the community,

386
00:40:57,440 --> 00:41:01,610
it would probably be really difficult to go into like a conservative Texas community,

387
00:41:01,610 --> 00:41:08,660
like we're a nonprofit and we have all these books you probably know about me, but what are they going to do at the library?

388
00:41:10,220 --> 00:41:13,220
And then going off of what you said about, like, my confidence.

389
00:41:14,330 --> 00:41:21,800
Banning even banning those books, I think it's not a good thing, even though I disagree with everything in it and.

390
00:41:23,050 --> 00:41:27,040
Because even when you're thinking about it from a research or programing perspective,

391
00:41:27,040 --> 00:41:31,620
like if somebody needs like we learn from these things by understanding what is in their brain.

392
00:41:31,630 --> 00:41:39,100
And so as long as they're being taught or like you are reading them in a certain way with a certain lens,

393
00:41:39,520 --> 00:41:44,500
then like notebooks shouldn't be banned either. And so it is a line.

394
00:41:44,560 --> 00:41:53,710
But I pose the question because I think this is as usual, a great presentation.

395
00:41:54,190 --> 00:41:58,899
Um, I pose the question because I, if you're, if you're the kind of picture you're in the,

396
00:41:58,900 --> 00:42:06,850
on the board of the organization or you're kind of thinking about their strategic plan, what, what, what is their impact going to be?

397
00:42:06,880 --> 00:42:15,970
So I think we, you know, we all have kind of had a very thoughtful dialog and kind of the idea of what the position is in terms of the

398
00:42:15,970 --> 00:42:21,280
policy position that the organization itself is responsible for coming up with something to do about it.

399
00:42:21,910 --> 00:42:26,680
And I think that that's why I think your second question is important and sort of

400
00:42:26,870 --> 00:42:31,509
to wrestle with this because as future leaders or leaders inside organizations,

401
00:42:31,510 --> 00:42:35,260
these are the these are the questions that come up, you know, what are we supposed to do?

402
00:42:36,040 --> 00:42:43,629
What are we supposed to do about it? You know, is it best to try to tackle it by making books available to people in those communities?

403
00:42:43,630 --> 00:42:49,060
Or is the information that's circulating through the community not even going to it?

404
00:42:49,270 --> 00:42:55,540
Will that obfuscate my ability to even get through? Meeting the people who live there aren't even going to be entertaining the idea of

405
00:42:55,540 --> 00:43:00,280
going to the Brooklyn Library because they're consuming a different set of information.

406
00:43:03,820 --> 00:43:05,200
Mark Yeah, it's kind of on that.

407
00:43:06,070 --> 00:43:15,610
I guess part of what an organization could do is kind of shift more to like a lobbying or advocacy role where I mean, you could at the state level,

408
00:43:15,610 --> 00:43:24,879
federal level, city level, whatever, like institute a law that says it's illegal to ban any kind of book in a public school from lawsuits and stuff.

409
00:43:24,880 --> 00:43:28,470
But that seems like a plausible policy you could push for.

410
00:43:28,480 --> 00:43:32,740
So that's something that could shift some efforts to focus on places that are not already.

411
00:43:33,220 --> 00:43:33,520
Yeah,

412
00:43:33,520 --> 00:43:42,220
I think it's like you need enough of that person power behind organizations like this to combat all of the rising ones that are trying to ban books.

413
00:43:42,830 --> 00:43:46,190
I know I was going to approach, but you know, I was going to keep it short,

414
00:43:46,270 --> 00:43:52,690
kind of try to approach it more from like an educational lens just because like just hearing like no one left,

415
00:43:52,780 --> 00:43:57,969
like everyone's comments because like I grew up in this community and like, I know nobody thinks like that.

416
00:43:57,970 --> 00:44:01,320
No one's thinking like, oh, it's so important for my kids to learn these things either.

417
00:44:01,630 --> 00:44:05,230
And like, even when I was raised, like I was very sheltered from a lot of things.

418
00:44:05,230 --> 00:44:10,030
Like you guarantee, like there was like no sex talk, so nothing is like just a shame on everything.

419
00:44:10,300 --> 00:44:14,260
And so she when it comes to stuff like this, so maybe if nonprofits have more of like this,

420
00:44:14,260 --> 00:44:23,139
like an educational focus where it's tailored based on the communities and they like have these sort of conversations on like the importance of,

421
00:44:23,140 --> 00:44:31,510
you know, like your kids knowing these things so they don't like X, Y, Z, and just like tailor it based on where these bands are happening.

422
00:44:31,510 --> 00:44:33,850
Like it could be tailored based on zero one or whatever.

423
00:44:34,060 --> 00:44:39,520
Just because I feel like, sure, we can do these things, but then no one's mindset is changing and like Dearborn,

424
00:44:39,520 --> 00:44:45,339
like the people are going to continue to have this like really strong negative feeling towards like these kinds of books.

425
00:44:45,340 --> 00:44:47,739
So like, it's like a generational thing too.

426
00:44:47,740 --> 00:44:53,530
So it's kind of hard if you just like the place that better not fix, like the thought process and things behind it.

427
00:44:56,030 --> 00:45:00,560
He's just really quick off that and just made me think of like a general policy center.

428
00:45:00,920 --> 00:45:05,420
I think there's a there's an argument to be made for like partnering with religious organizations,

429
00:45:05,630 --> 00:45:12,080
institutions and educating, too, that science is like a lot of stuff watching bands.

430
00:45:15,020 --> 00:45:19,740
So I think these organizations also just have to some degree.

431
00:45:20,390 --> 00:45:28,490
Another question for everyone to consider is these organizations have a unique capability to dialog

432
00:45:28,970 --> 00:45:37,010
and to create create opportunities for dialog where policymakers perhaps can't or politicians can't.

433
00:45:38,030 --> 00:45:47,330
But the nonprofits sort of have a bit of latitude to, you know, work through their mission to engage in that in that space.

434
00:45:47,360 --> 00:45:56,920
So I would say, as we continue to sort of go through these, you know, there was a presentation last year prior to the overturning of the the.

435
00:45:57,940 --> 00:46:07,120
Or part of the doctor's decision. But the the the discussion that we had as a as a learning community last year was basically.

436
00:46:08,340 --> 00:46:12,840
What is Planned Parenthood or some of these other organizations to do and what is there to do?

437
00:46:13,200 --> 00:46:17,030
And, you know, much of the discussion sort of changed to, okay, you know,

438
00:46:17,100 --> 00:46:21,179
making it possible for people who require services to get to where they need to

439
00:46:21,180 --> 00:46:25,080
go if they're not able to be in if they're not in a state where it's available.

440
00:46:25,800 --> 00:46:28,600
But you can see how even quickly throughout the net,

441
00:46:28,630 --> 00:46:35,310
the last year this has gotten to the point where now it's directly on the ballot because after a certain point,

442
00:46:35,760 --> 00:46:38,670
there's only so much the organization can do.

443
00:46:39,180 --> 00:46:45,989
But I guess the question I have to go back to your presentations with the kind of sort of these larger policy questions

444
00:46:45,990 --> 00:46:55,080
is what can the organizations do to provide opportunity for those who in the moment don't have access to something?

445
00:46:55,110 --> 00:47:02,910
And then also, what is their role to influence or work toward a systemic change so they can address it?

446
00:47:02,940 --> 00:47:06,700
I think you're seeing that theme come out across these different presentations.

447
00:47:07,140 --> 00:47:14,390
Again, another outstanding presentation and I think you'll see.

448
00:47:16,850 --> 00:47:21,280
All right. Oh, yeah. Oh, you are pretty.

449
00:47:23,650 --> 00:47:27,070
And I sincerely mean it when I say it. I'm not saying it just to say it every week.

450
00:47:27,070 --> 00:47:33,290
It really is. I commend everyone. We just keep track of how many times we say, Well, that's fine if you.

451
00:47:34,480 --> 00:47:38,560
Is there a Tableau dashboard on what's going on?

452
00:47:39,250 --> 00:47:49,010
That's good. I have to, you know, but I remember I was like, okay, polio has returned.

453
00:47:49,030 --> 00:47:52,370
Are you guys up to date on polio? No.

454
00:47:52,390 --> 00:48:01,210
Okay. Really exciting. Okay, so I'm going to try to not talk for, like, two whole hours about polio.

455
00:48:01,990 --> 00:48:05,520
This is the agenda that will hope to stick to.

456
00:48:06,070 --> 00:48:14,799
Polio is back in New York. The CDC is looking at trying a different vaccine to help combat the outbreak.

457
00:48:14,800 --> 00:48:22,060
They're thinking about history is still relevant to you at the University of Michigan School of Public Health.

458
00:48:23,800 --> 00:48:27,340
And then a look at the nonprofit that made the polio vaccine.

459
00:48:27,730 --> 00:48:31,150
That was. All right.

460
00:48:31,170 --> 00:48:36,990
So in the news, there hasn't been a case of polio in the U.S. in a very long time,

461
00:48:37,140 --> 00:48:42,930
and that's the case over the summer here, I think, July and July, this past summer.

462
00:48:43,680 --> 00:48:49,110
And that case was in an adult man who was unvaccinated.

463
00:48:49,110 --> 00:49:01,860
And it was a case of paralytic polio, which is a big deal, because the virus that that case was linked to was not a form of wild virus.

464
00:49:01,860 --> 00:49:09,000
So not but the same viruses that causing epidemics throughout earlier parts of the century.

465
00:49:09,390 --> 00:49:14,520
Instead, it was a virus that was from a vaccine.

466
00:49:15,300 --> 00:49:27,300
So that this this man was afflicted with paralytic polio was that someone else received an oral vaccine,

467
00:49:28,020 --> 00:49:32,429
and that vaccine was transmitted from the vaccinated person.

468
00:49:32,430 --> 00:49:36,150
That virus was transmitted from the vaccinated person to this gentleman,

469
00:49:37,080 --> 00:49:44,820
mutated and became more virulent than it was expected to be causing paralysis.

470
00:49:45,300 --> 00:49:56,850
So just to be clear, so that the person would receive the vaccine, they were receiving a form of the virus and then they started to shed virus.

471
00:49:56,850 --> 00:50:02,280
And the person who contracted polio got it because they were not vaccinated for Ebola.

472
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:07,200
Exactly. And it was in between and mutated and became more virulent.

473
00:50:07,560 --> 00:50:14,430
So we don't expect vaccine variants of polio virus to cause paralysis, but it is possible they can do it.

474
00:50:16,650 --> 00:50:19,800
Here's a just a very brief science lesson for you.

475
00:50:20,190 --> 00:50:26,640
The the vaccine comes in two types. It comes in oral polio vaccine and injected polio vaccine.

476
00:50:27,870 --> 00:50:34,600
They're also known as seven Salk vaccines, which you should try to commit to memory because Jonas Salk is your guy.

477
00:50:34,650 --> 00:50:37,980
You can see this about school, public health, you know the history here.

478
00:50:39,060 --> 00:50:45,000
Okay, so the Sabin vaccine, the oral one is inexpensive.

479
00:50:46,080 --> 00:50:52,380
It's great for developing countries and for places where transportation and refrigeration are difficult.

480
00:50:52,740 --> 00:51:02,940
And it's what has been used in most of the globe to attempt to eradicate polio because it's a live virus vaccine.

481
00:51:04,470 --> 00:51:09,390
That vaccine can be trans, that virus can be transmitted,

482
00:51:10,560 --> 00:51:19,200
but there's a lower risk of transmission if someone is infected because you get really great gut immunity when you take that vaccine.

483
00:51:19,440 --> 00:51:26,610
All those leg strains, as we talked about, can escape circulating and it can cause trouble.

484
00:51:26,730 --> 00:51:31,000
The Salk vaccine, which is the one that was developed here.

485
00:51:31,030 --> 00:51:39,070
Well, but that sort of was the grandfather of the School of Public Health, a grandchild.

486
00:51:39,120 --> 00:51:48,690
School of Public Health is is a multiple dose vaccine that requires more resources and is extremely effective at preventing disease.

487
00:51:49,050 --> 00:51:54,780
But people who are vaccinated and don't get ill can still easily transmit that virus.

488
00:51:55,650 --> 00:52:02,880
So someone who's been vaccinated with the oral polio vaccine if they are infected.

489
00:52:03,980 --> 00:52:07,610
Are not going to get sick and are not going to pass it around.

490
00:52:08,560 --> 00:52:14,890
But someone who has gotten the injected polio vaccine is not going to get sick and may still pass the virus around.

491
00:52:15,160 --> 00:52:24,420
So it makes sense. That vaccine because it's made of little bits of killed virus cannot be transmitted.

492
00:52:25,050 --> 00:52:28,560
So you're never going to make someone sick after you get the injected vaccine.

493
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:33,080
Questions. The science class.

494
00:52:36,260 --> 00:52:39,410
This is the benefit to having HIV AIDS.

495
00:52:41,900 --> 00:52:48,620
Okay. So this is sort of a status update on polio around the world.

496
00:52:49,040 --> 00:52:52,340
A benefit excuse. The only benefit.

497
00:52:54,110 --> 00:53:05,630
And polio around the world is largely I know you guys can't read this, but yellow, green and purple cases are all vaccine variants.

498
00:53:06,380 --> 00:53:12,980
They are all coming from oral vaccination, the vaccine strains that we have put out there.

499
00:53:13,870 --> 00:53:23,679
It's only these red cases that are still wildtype, that are still the original virus that are causing polio.

500
00:53:23,680 --> 00:53:32,590
And that's endemic right now in Afghanistan and Pakistan and a little bit also in Malawi and Mozambique.

501
00:53:33,690 --> 00:53:39,150
This is the case that's in the news today. A single case in New York City.

502
00:53:39,660 --> 00:53:43,050
And you may wonder why that is being referred to as an outbreak.

503
00:53:43,560 --> 00:53:52,800
And it's because although there's only one guy with paralysis, there is polio and New York City's wastewater treatment.

504
00:53:53,430 --> 00:53:56,880
And no matter how many times they check it, they just keep finding it there.

505
00:53:57,150 --> 00:54:03,870
So I know because polio is shed signaling that that virus is circulating in the community,

506
00:54:04,290 --> 00:54:09,810
even though people don't seem to be getting a diagnosis or coming down with symptoms.

507
00:54:10,710 --> 00:54:20,850
And the reason that's worrisome is because there are people out there who are not vaccinated, in particular on the tails of the COVID pandemic.

508
00:54:21,480 --> 00:54:28,490
Lots of people missed routine care and preventive care and are falling behind in vaccination status.

509
00:54:28,530 --> 00:54:34,800
So there's really a risk that that single case could turn into a bigger problem.

510
00:54:35,760 --> 00:54:48,300
And the health department has been on a major campaign to vaccinate people using the only vaccine that's available in the United States,

511
00:54:48,750 --> 00:54:58,050
which is the injected polio vaccine. And as you recall from your science lesson, the injected vaccine will protect them from becoming ill,

512
00:54:58,500 --> 00:55:02,340
but it will not stop transmission of polio through the community.

513
00:55:04,670 --> 00:55:12,380
So also in the news, the CDC is discussing the use of the oral polio vaccine for the first time in a long time.

514
00:55:14,300 --> 00:55:26,030
To sort of brief history of this is that the injected polio vaccine was the product of Jonas Salk's work at the University of Pittsburgh.

515
00:55:26,390 --> 00:55:30,740
Jonas Salk's mentor was Tommy Francis of the University of Michigan.

516
00:55:31,790 --> 00:55:39,020
And when the vaccine was developed, it was trialed on a massive scale in the United States.

517
00:55:39,650 --> 00:55:56,360
And the vaccine trials themselves eradicated a lot of polio in the U.S., such that when when the trials were finished, there was much less work to do.

518
00:55:57,140 --> 00:56:05,540
Then there was a scandal in which 11 I think 11 children died because of some vaccine contamination.

519
00:56:06,590 --> 00:56:18,020
And in that moment, Albert Sabin, who had done with this oral vaccine and said that's a long time rival of Jonas Salk, I told you so.

520
00:56:18,020 --> 00:56:21,920
I should have been allowed to use my oral vaccine the whole time.

521
00:56:22,580 --> 00:56:34,549
So the United States switched to oral vaccinations and continued to use the oral polio vaccine like virus all the way,

522
00:56:34,550 --> 00:56:41,600
I think into the nineties actually, at which point we began giving parents a choice between the two vaccines and then

523
00:56:41,600 --> 00:56:47,840
about 20 years ago switched entirely to the inactivated injected poison vaccine.

524
00:56:49,550 --> 00:56:53,810
The reason that this is fascinating is because it's also against.

525
00:56:55,690 --> 00:57:08,320
This is the same headline, really, except it's from 1962 when when we were initially arguing about which sort of vaccine to use.

526
00:57:08,870 --> 00:57:19,510
And and part of why it's a stunning headline is because in the global plan to eradicate polio entirely,

527
00:57:21,310 --> 00:57:25,330
you might be able to guess what one of the steps will be based on,

528
00:57:25,330 --> 00:57:32,530
like how few red dots there are left on the map and how many green and yellow dots there are on that map.

529
00:57:33,910 --> 00:57:37,350
What do you think would be a good next step in eradicating calling?

530
00:57:41,710 --> 00:57:45,490
Switching to soft switching, switching to socks.

531
00:57:45,490 --> 00:57:54,490
So instead of like jumps, switching, what we have been doing, I say we but is,

532
00:57:54,990 --> 00:58:03,040
is to reduce the number of vaccine variants of viral viral variants in the oral polio vaccine,

533
00:58:03,040 --> 00:58:10,420
so used to contain three variants and we're slowly knocking them out as we see less and less of each of those different types.

534
00:58:10,720 --> 00:58:16,420
The goal being eventually to use entirely the injected inactivated vaccine.

535
00:58:17,730 --> 00:58:29,910
So to move toward the only oral polio vaccine is sort of stunning because it indicates that we are also moving away from the process.

536
00:58:30,600 --> 00:58:41,460
That makes sense. Here's the very brief history of the Midwestern vaccine.

537
00:58:42,420 --> 00:58:48,000
Tommy Francis at the building next door toward Jonas Salk.

538
00:58:49,480 --> 00:59:01,480
Jonas Salk vaccine trials happened in 1954, and then Tommy Francis was hired to review his work because he didn't actually like Jonas Salk very much.

539
00:59:01,600 --> 00:59:07,990
But they really, really trusted him to objectively review that data.

540
00:59:08,590 --> 00:59:19,180
And when he announced that it was successful in 1955, honestly, I think I think in Bracken Auditorium, he was on the steps.

541
00:59:20,380 --> 00:59:23,500
If you're interested in the break up, of course.

542
00:59:23,530 --> 00:59:35,109
Fascinating. Immediately after that announcement, he was rushed inside to discuss the licensing of several manufacturers in the United States.

543
00:59:35,110 --> 00:59:43,920
And that happened so quickly and with so little review that one of the manufacturers who received an immediate license was called Cutter Laboratories,

544
00:59:45,430 --> 00:59:56,399
and they mixed up some. I think monkey tissue or something crazy and got some simian viruses in there that were

545
00:59:56,400 --> 01:00:05,639
super virulent and ended up causing hundreds or thousands of cases of polio in children.

546
01:00:05,640 --> 01:00:15,330
And there were 11 kids who died of polio. So you can see actually the roots of some vaccine hesitancy are well-founded.

547
01:00:16,110 --> 01:00:20,820
But in the meantime, Albert Sabin has been working on this oral polio vaccine.

548
01:00:21,480 --> 01:00:29,880
There really wasn't room left in the United States to try this. So if you try to live in the Soviet Union at the time and then took a global.

549
01:00:33,910 --> 01:00:37,090
Okay. I'm supposed to talk about nonprofits in this class.

550
01:00:37,900 --> 01:00:44,540
So? So the nonprofit story behind all of this is that of FDR.

551
01:00:45,670 --> 01:00:51,780
Polio in 1921. Although there's a little bit of discussion about whether it was actually polio.

552
01:00:52,260 --> 01:00:57,150
Would you go with that? And I think he was attempting to rehabilitate.

553
01:00:57,540 --> 01:01:00,870
He went to a place in Georgia called Warm Springs Resort,

554
01:01:01,350 --> 01:01:11,909
where he found that the place was a bit of a mess and founded this foundation with a couple of friends to raise money,

555
01:01:11,910 --> 01:01:15,480
because that place made him feel better than any other therapy that he had tried.

556
01:01:15,870 --> 01:01:20,340
And it involved a lot of sort of physical therapy and massage and swimming.

557
01:01:21,210 --> 01:01:26,820
As you can see here. So he worked with Basil O'Connor, who was a friend and a lawyer.

558
01:01:28,200 --> 01:01:44,580
And at first the treasurer of this foundation, says O'Connor, was a philanthropic genius, some would say, and revolutionized the way that they.

559
01:01:46,040 --> 01:01:48,360
We're still relevant to today's topic as well.

560
01:01:50,810 --> 01:01:58,670
They eventually evolved that foundation into what they called the National Foundation for Infantile Paralysis.

561
01:01:59,030 --> 01:02:06,080
So rather than just fundraising for rehabilitative efforts, they began to fundraise for also prevention of polio.

562
01:02:06,830 --> 01:02:15,710
And and that further evolved into the March of Dimes, which you guys have today.

563
01:02:18,050 --> 01:02:28,530
This is sort of the March of Dimes marketing and just through one slide to show, to demonstrate that they really had some genius moves.

564
01:02:28,580 --> 01:02:34,160
So they invented that whole top rope. They invented what is now known as poster child.

565
01:02:35,370 --> 01:02:45,420
These were the first poster children and had all kinds of other really unique fundraising strategies.

566
01:02:45,990 --> 01:02:48,870
These were cans that were passed around in movie theaters.

567
01:02:48,900 --> 01:02:55,470
You would sit down to watch your movie theater and people would put a diamond while they were waiting for the show to begin.

568
01:02:55,590 --> 01:03:06,860
They also left those cans unattended on street corners and passed children on radio shows and whatnot to please put a dime in every year.

569
01:03:06,870 --> 01:03:12,510
So you'd have a lot of school children who once a year tried to save a dime and put it in March of Dimes.

570
01:03:13,890 --> 01:03:20,880
This this was a campaign with people sending a dime to the White House in an envelope.

571
01:03:21,390 --> 01:03:31,680
I would say June 1938, it was Penny. So the White House at one point had 300,000 times upwards to open.

572
01:03:33,240 --> 01:03:42,150
The president's birthday ball was another tactic in which they basically demanded that

573
01:03:42,390 --> 01:03:48,420
every city in the country host a ball and demanded that the city organize that themselves.

574
01:03:48,750 --> 01:03:57,660
But the March of Dimes would harass and write to city organizers and say, Why haven't you scheduled out yet?

575
01:03:58,470 --> 01:04:02,760
We recommend that you hold it in this location and that you charge this much money for the tickets.

576
01:04:03,380 --> 01:04:09,750
And so that was a huge fundraiser that recurred annually on FDR birthday.

577
01:04:12,650 --> 01:04:23,470
Basil O'Connor was behind most of this and was generating just enormous amounts of money one dime at a time.

578
01:04:23,480 --> 01:04:31,340
So he is separately credited with this self-sustaining source of funds and

579
01:04:31,460 --> 01:04:40,910
support of research as sort of a new style of foundations for health research.

580
01:04:43,630 --> 01:04:49,390
And so the reason I honed in on March of Dimes is that when I saw this news,

581
01:04:50,740 --> 01:04:56,410
I remembered the way that their mission had shifted over time and wondered to

582
01:04:56,410 --> 01:05:02,320
myself if their mission would shift again in response to that kind of news.

583
01:05:02,860 --> 01:05:14,950
So early on, no rehabilitation was their plan that moved into prevention, and rehabilitation eventually funded those vaccine trials for Jonas Salk.

584
01:05:15,370 --> 01:05:21,190
And then as paralysis became more and more rare,

585
01:05:21,610 --> 01:05:30,910
they dropped infantile paralysis from the name of their competitions and began to focus also on birth defects, arthritis and viral diseases.

586
01:05:31,540 --> 01:05:35,799
That was sort of a momentous decision, I think.

587
01:05:35,800 --> 01:05:39,010
And then it again on birth defects and infant mortality.

588
01:05:39,790 --> 01:05:45,760
And into the seventies actually renamed themselves the March of Dimes birth defects condition.

589
01:05:47,800 --> 01:05:55,480
In recent decades, they have also begun to identify with mothers and supporting the health of mothers.

590
01:05:56,110 --> 01:06:00,040
So their current slogan is Healthy Moms, Strong Babies.

591
01:06:02,710 --> 01:06:04,600
Current information on March of Dimes.

592
01:06:05,260 --> 01:06:14,740
Their mission is to lead the fight for the health of all lots of babies with goals to end deaths between birth and death.

593
01:06:15,720 --> 01:06:25,770
And then this is a biopsy of March of Dimes. So you can see some of their engagement with maternal, maybe help some of their research investment.

594
01:06:26,190 --> 01:06:36,510
And then this quick biopsy of finances, their net assets are troubling and have been at two stars on this is Charity Navigator.

595
01:06:36,900 --> 01:06:41,280
And you can see the declining expenses that.

596
01:06:43,130 --> 01:06:49,340
So a couple of questions about the March of Dimes and their mission,

597
01:06:50,720 --> 01:06:57,110
knowing that polio is this global threat and on the verge of eradication with this new outbreak,

598
01:06:59,030 --> 01:07:02,790
what do you think of this as an opportunity for March of Dimes?

599
01:07:02,810 --> 01:07:09,500
They're not doing great financially. Is this a moment where they might want to return to their original mission?

600
01:07:13,850 --> 01:07:19,370
Exactly. I think it's in their kind of mission to do that.

601
01:07:20,480 --> 01:07:24,410
We've talked a lot about this class, about how your mission needs to be flexible.

602
01:07:24,650 --> 01:07:31,430
And I think since polio kind of went away at one point, they had to make that move to be more flexible.

603
01:07:31,670 --> 01:07:35,310
But obviously, their mission is to have healthy babies and mothers like.

604
01:07:35,360 --> 01:07:46,130
That's something important, obviously, to go back to. In the US.

605
01:07:48,590 --> 01:07:54,590
I must say honestly, maybe I am not seeing the link below.

606
01:07:55,130 --> 01:07:58,310
How did I mean? I understood the beginning shift away.

607
01:07:58,310 --> 01:08:05,280
But then like, how did you end up at mothers and. Babies or I'm sorry, whatever it is now, I think.

608
01:08:07,010 --> 01:08:14,150
I need to know if they're bored. Why do you think that's where the money's going?

609
01:08:14,360 --> 01:08:21,090
Just isn't like. I know. I didn't really. I needed to realize that nonprofits can shift that much anyway, but I.

610
01:08:21,110 --> 01:08:25,670
So this is a I appreciate bringing this is a really, really important example.

611
01:08:26,270 --> 01:08:32,180
What do you do if your primary disease that you're working on disappears?

612
01:08:33,110 --> 01:08:36,530
A lot of business? Yeah. So then just close that door.

613
01:08:36,560 --> 01:08:41,959
I mean, actually, that's kind of super. I know you're going to all the people who work there, the board members, the Anthropocene, all that.

614
01:08:41,960 --> 01:08:45,020
What do you do? You think it's fair?

615
01:08:45,650 --> 01:08:50,629
I just I don't know, because then it's just it's like so different. I was like, wait, that's so, like, random.

616
01:08:50,630 --> 01:08:56,480
But I know it does feel really, really different. So I want to just plant this for everyone to give this thought because this is a very

617
01:08:56,480 --> 01:09:02,900
specific to health based nonprofit organizations or health services oriented ones.

618
01:09:03,590 --> 01:09:10,730
If we are successful in achieving the mission that the organization is working toward, then what?

619
01:09:12,920 --> 01:09:18,700
What do you do? So do we actually as an organization have an interest in achieving the objective,

620
01:09:19,240 --> 01:09:24,050
or is it you just kind of push it a little bit more, a little bit more, even more?

621
01:09:25,790 --> 01:09:31,879
Because at the end of the day, I mean, as you now are all learning from deconstructing these organizations,

622
01:09:31,880 --> 01:09:40,670
there are organizations having to assess expenses, pay salaries.

623
01:09:40,820 --> 01:09:48,940
I mean, for the majority of these, if you look at your papers, it's the salaries that are sitting in the organization.

624
01:09:48,950 --> 01:09:54,800
So I'm not putting you under on the stand here. I just I just it's a great question because it's like, why?

625
01:09:54,860 --> 01:10:00,650
Why are you all of a sudden now? You were all about polio, but now you're about all this other stuff.

626
01:10:01,860 --> 01:10:07,490
Christiane, I saw you. Maybe you had a hand up. I wasn't trying to be I was dressed this question first.

627
01:10:08,120 --> 01:10:14,690
Did you say that my stance is not going to be for you like I or did I just like that it was the say again,

628
01:10:15,170 --> 01:10:19,040
I was just asking if you feel that March of Dimes wasn't doing too well or I mean that.

629
01:10:19,400 --> 01:10:28,220
Oh, I think Ali was showing the revenue and it's like what was going on here with their with their net assets -20 million.

630
01:10:29,570 --> 01:10:37,580
Yeah, I, I just feel like we are in a time in this country or nobody wants to hear the word vaccine anymore.

631
01:10:38,120 --> 01:10:42,650
So I am very nervous for them to shift back to polio.

632
01:10:42,890 --> 01:10:51,620
I think it's important, but I think that they will have to have a very well thought out strategy for how to push this vaccine being important,

633
01:10:51,830 --> 01:10:54,080
even though there's only one confirmed case, like you said,

634
01:10:54,090 --> 01:11:00,409
like I don't know if it's going to look good in the public eye, public opinion to push a vaccine.

635
01:11:00,410 --> 01:11:06,080
But it doesn't seem to be like such a big threat, especially after it folded out of the inside.

636
01:11:06,080 --> 01:11:09,780
But yeah. So it's interesting business move, you're saying.

637
01:11:09,850 --> 01:11:13,969
Yeah. So it's interesting you say that. I see.

638
01:11:13,970 --> 01:11:16,850
If I go to a second, you say that because.

639
01:11:19,070 --> 01:11:25,970
It goes again to the same discussion point, which I think has been kind of coming out thematically here, at least in everyone's talks.

640
01:11:27,100 --> 01:11:29,530
What is the root of this? Right.

641
01:11:29,810 --> 01:11:39,130
If you know, if the organization is set up to advocate for vaccination, but you can't even get people to go for that because that is the barrier.

642
01:11:40,000 --> 01:11:43,110
What's the good in having an organization like this that has, you know,

643
01:11:43,270 --> 01:11:49,240
a setup to make it possible for people to get vaccinated if people aren't even willing to come in the door,

644
01:11:49,670 --> 01:11:56,010
you know, if they're not willing to come through. So it's a it's an interesting question I think that you're all grappling with in your presentations.

645
01:11:56,020 --> 01:12:01,719
It's just these organizations do have missions, but they also have programmatic offerings that they have to they have to decide,

646
01:12:01,720 --> 01:12:04,410
like, what are we going to invest our dollars and our efforts into?

647
01:12:04,840 --> 01:12:08,950
It's great to have something that goes in a nice annual report that says, you know,

648
01:12:08,950 --> 01:12:12,870
we made it possible for this many people to bubble up, but what's the impact?

649
01:12:12,880 --> 01:12:17,440
It's actually happening. I think your presentation is making it very much to that point.

650
01:12:17,500 --> 01:12:21,910
Katie, go ahead. Oh, yeah. I just I had a clarifying question, too.

651
01:12:24,250 --> 01:12:31,120
So you mentioned in your question that the vaccine rates plummeted during the pandemic.

652
01:12:31,840 --> 01:12:41,680
And in my experience, it seems like people I know are either pro all vaccinations or anti vaccinations.

653
01:12:41,680 --> 01:12:48,520
And so I just wondered and maybe you already said this and I missed it, but since this outbreak has happened in the US,

654
01:12:48,820 --> 01:12:55,120
has there been an increase in people wanting to get vaccinated who aren't are wanting to get their children vaccinated?

655
01:12:55,120 --> 01:12:58,659
Because it seems like I'm just making an assumption.

656
01:12:58,660 --> 01:13:05,410
I'm thinking of some people I know who don't vaccinate their kids and I feel like they would say,

657
01:13:05,860 --> 01:13:10,809
Well, no, why would I vaccinate my child when this outbreak happened?

658
01:13:10,810 --> 01:13:19,560
Because of a vaccine. Right? Well, I mean, so I could argue with you, you know, that it didn't happen because this vaccine,

659
01:13:19,570 --> 01:13:25,390
this really the US vaccine isn't the source of the circulating vaccine variant.

660
01:13:25,420 --> 01:13:36,399
But I. I think there are some subtleties there that that maybe are are in you're right.

661
01:13:36,400 --> 01:13:46,150
People tend to be like probiotics or antibiotics. But when when a family is in your office and and, you know, is a sort of a swing voter,

662
01:13:47,350 --> 01:13:55,990
that they make decisions about which vaccine they'll get because maybe they're willing to get one or maybe they're willing to get two.

663
01:13:56,230 --> 01:14:04,390
But seven is too many, and the lowest priority for decades has been polio.

664
01:14:05,210 --> 01:14:10,210
So so there are a lot of anti-vaxx families that are at risk,

665
01:14:10,570 --> 01:14:19,510
but also a lot of sort of vaccine hesitant or a little bit delayed in vaccination families that are at risk because we have de-emphasized polio,

666
01:14:19,900 --> 01:14:26,560
it's gone. It's not in the U.S. So if there's going to be one that you don't get it right now, once again, polio.

667
01:14:27,130 --> 01:14:35,980
So then do you think those people who are maybe in between have started to VAX or has

668
01:14:35,980 --> 01:14:39,220
there been any research about whether or not they've started to vaccinate for polio?

669
01:14:40,000 --> 01:14:44,170
Well, the public health campaign has I think that's been great.

670
01:14:44,170 --> 01:14:48,070
I mean, they're getting a lot of vaccines and to a lot of people in New York,

671
01:14:48,460 --> 01:14:57,760
but it's just not enough to test what they're finding in the wastewater, which, you know, it's actually also not perfect science.

672
01:14:57,760 --> 01:15:01,750
It's hard to quantify, like how many people are there at the community, you know,

673
01:15:01,990 --> 01:15:05,910
because they really can't do that with the methods that they're using to test squeeze water.

674
01:15:06,900 --> 01:15:17,400
So it is an interesting case because I think that but I think that what you've laid out for us in both presentations today and again,

675
01:15:17,400 --> 01:15:25,860
I come back to this common theme is what to your question, like what what is the mission of the organization and what what is their primary objective?

676
01:15:26,400 --> 01:15:33,479
What are they looking to do? One could make the case maybe that this organization could have pivoted rather than saying,

677
01:15:33,480 --> 01:15:43,930
we're going to go and kind of look for resources related to another disease process or another health outcome.

678
01:15:44,250 --> 01:15:51,870
We're going to focus our efforts on the fact that there is misinformation where there is and of vaccine confusion.

679
01:15:51,870 --> 01:15:57,520
And we're going to make it our business to try and work on that for the next 20 years while polio cases are low.

680
01:15:58,110 --> 01:16:01,049
We're going to be working on that at issue as we see that that's happening.

681
01:16:01,050 --> 01:16:07,080
And we're going to try to make that our core goal, because right now there isn't an outbreak necessarily to respond to.

682
01:16:07,530 --> 01:16:12,480
So the question becomes who is going to fund that? Who's interested in delivering on that, so to speak?

683
01:16:13,440 --> 01:16:22,079
But if the organization is always only there to respond as an emergency or always only there to respond with filling in the blank,

684
01:16:22,080 --> 01:16:25,229
so to speak, but no one's ever working on the steps before.

685
01:16:25,230 --> 01:16:28,920
That is too late to the point that everyone was kind of making.

686
01:16:29,640 --> 01:16:34,500
What are you supposed to do? And I think that that's that's I don't mean to say that with outrage.

687
01:16:34,500 --> 01:16:41,010
I just I just don't mean to challenge all of you to think about this as you think about being a leader inside of this organization or

688
01:16:41,010 --> 01:16:48,870
manager or I'm on the board of these organizations to really being strategically thinking what is the organization's contribution?

689
01:16:49,320 --> 01:16:58,649
You know, great that it does X, but is that actually getting at what we need to be focusing on or are we just chasing the dollar or are we just

690
01:16:58,650 --> 01:17:03,360
chasing after the philanthropists and the people who want to give money so that we can continue to be here?

691
01:17:03,780 --> 01:17:11,970
But in essence, we're not really accomplishing what will be necessary to to stamp out a problem when it does become much more serious.

692
01:17:12,480 --> 01:17:17,010
And I will also add to this, because I do live 10 minutes away from this neighborhood.

693
01:17:17,010 --> 01:17:21,270
It's a very, very religious neighborhood where they don't want to get vaccinated.

694
01:17:21,480 --> 01:17:28,500
So it might not be like a place to go like get vaccinated so that I would know that.

695
01:17:28,680 --> 01:17:35,700
You're important point, though. Then again, what does the what do the organizations do to reach those communities?

696
01:17:36,120 --> 01:17:40,820
Because they just say we're going to put them in a box and just say, no, we're not going to deal with those folks.

697
01:17:40,830 --> 01:17:44,340
They're not going to if they're not going to.

698
01:17:44,340 --> 01:17:50,460
And we keep saying they they they they they they they well, after a while, there's not anybody left who's going to be there to do it.

699
01:17:51,810 --> 01:17:55,110
You can't do it if it's only, you know, 10% of people are interested.

700
01:17:56,890 --> 01:18:00,330
So your input on the second chapter.

701
01:18:01,780 --> 01:18:08,050
Part of me grieves because I think it's March of Dimes with all of the momentum that they had at the time,

702
01:18:08,740 --> 01:18:15,940
had to have concluded that the US didn't need them anymore and moved to global eradication efforts.

703
01:18:17,770 --> 01:18:21,460
It's basically a slogan Save. And I hated each other so much.

704
01:18:21,790 --> 01:18:24,850
And they had they had merged forces together.

705
01:18:25,870 --> 01:18:35,230
It feels like we would be in a very different place now, and I'm not sure what stopped them from following their mission across the globe.

706
01:18:35,260 --> 01:18:40,720
Is that a challenging transition to make to leave the US and become an international nonprofit?

707
01:18:41,650 --> 01:18:47,410
Yes, I mean, there's governance questions. There's philanthropy, philanthropic questions.

708
01:18:47,410 --> 01:18:51,940
Who are your donors at that point? You know, who's responsible for the revenue?

709
01:18:52,180 --> 01:18:56,140
They don't have. None of these organizations have a private product that they can sell.

710
01:18:56,590 --> 01:19:03,190
So they're selling their mission. They're getting those who contribute to say, yeah, this is worth it because you can deliver on X.

711
01:19:03,760 --> 01:19:09,670
So now you're saying rather than delivering on helping children in Warm Springs,

712
01:19:09,970 --> 01:19:17,470
we're going to help children in another continent that donors may not be interested in giving anymore.

713
01:19:17,620 --> 01:19:21,190
The grants from the government may not be interested in providing anymore.

714
01:19:21,730 --> 01:19:26,680
But then I would also say the organization, if you're building a strategic plan,

715
01:19:26,680 --> 01:19:30,820
which you'll all be doing just in a few short weeks, you got to look forward.

716
01:19:31,030 --> 01:19:34,090
You got to say, all right, right now this is working out.

717
01:19:34,210 --> 01:19:39,250
But in five, six, seven, eight years, if we're successful at this school, it's going to open up this problem.

718
01:19:39,520 --> 01:19:50,709
And now we've got to start working on that one and not just sort of living off the the the the success of today because this is how I think,

719
01:19:50,710 --> 01:19:54,420
you know, you start to see a pattern. This is how you start to see that this is where it ends up.

720
01:19:54,430 --> 01:20:01,180
This is a very great example because this is the extreme version. The disease is eradicated and then there's no mission life.

721
01:20:02,200 --> 01:20:10,810
So in one. But here we are. It's back. And this is the foundation that you would most likely say, Hey, they ought to know what to do about it.

722
01:20:11,350 --> 01:20:18,300
But it's not their. Or its weakened in terms of its capability.

723
01:20:19,660 --> 01:20:25,000
Thank you. Excellent, excellent. Excellent. One more time.

724
01:20:25,120 --> 01:20:31,850
I don't know. Here. Oh, that's a good. Sure.

725
01:20:33,180 --> 01:20:42,150
All right. Okay, everyone, we're going to take a one minute stretch, break this one out, leaving one minute stretch break.

726
01:20:43,290 --> 01:20:47,760
You got it. Okay, let me just keep getting out.

727
01:20:47,900 --> 01:20:53,490
So, you guys, basically what you just have to do is while you're in the Ross ritual.

728
01:20:53,640 --> 01:20:57,020
Yes, you're totally right. Oh, quick.

729
01:20:57,270 --> 01:20:59,518
Make it fast. It's your sound from when you're finished with your e-mails yourself, your family, your friends, like.

730
01:21:01,216 --> 01:21:08,026
Same to me. I would have. Yeah, but it would be like it would seem to be more complex than just.

731
01:21:10,936 --> 01:21:15,126
Okay, thank you. All right, take another one.

732
01:21:15,136 --> 01:21:19,826
I'm going to try a few of them. Get everybody move in here. I don't know.

733
01:21:20,596 --> 01:21:31,215
All right. So today today I want to talk about my stuff about marketing, marketing and communication, the next sort of area of your organization.

734
01:21:31,216 --> 01:21:34,336
So we've been on kind of a tour of the different parts of these organizations.

735
01:21:34,876 --> 01:21:41,506
You talk about the board, talk about the CEO talked about strategic partnerships.

736
01:21:41,506 --> 01:21:46,246
We talked about philanthropy and fundraising, talk about ethics.

737
01:21:47,026 --> 01:21:51,646
So today, I want to kind of turn our attention to marketing communication and it's very timely.

738
01:21:51,646 --> 01:21:55,986
And Ali, thank you for your time. You showed us the different examples from the campaigns.

739
01:21:55,996 --> 01:22:01,106
I think that that was a great example of how organizations approach different ways of communicating.

740
01:22:02,356 --> 01:22:07,726
The chief marketing officer in a large organization is typically the person is going to be responsible for this area.

741
01:22:08,206 --> 01:22:14,236
Um, but marketing is not just about, you know, letting people know what you do.

742
01:22:14,566 --> 01:22:21,556
Marketing is about other aspects. So we have what we like to call internal marketing and then external marketing.

743
01:22:22,186 --> 01:22:31,306
So internal marketing referring to how we analyze our organization operations and then how we forecast.

744
01:22:31,876 --> 01:22:37,156
So what I need that that is looking across in our strategic plan and understanding where

745
01:22:37,156 --> 01:22:41,955
are we heading and what do we need to do in order to continue to promote our activities,

746
01:22:41,956 --> 01:22:48,826
our programs, our services to move forward externally facing, uh, on the other hand,

747
01:22:49,216 --> 01:22:52,606
are some of the activities that maybe we're a bit more familiar with.

748
01:22:52,726 --> 01:23:03,346
So public relations, customer relations, employer marketing referrals, if you're a health care delivery organization, traditional media, online media,

749
01:23:04,516 --> 01:23:09,196
all of these kind of roll up though into having a strategy and then, of course,

750
01:23:09,556 --> 01:23:12,666
thinking about what your brand is going to be and then those partnerships.

751
01:23:12,696 --> 01:23:19,866
And so you're going to outline for you the functions of marketing inside of an organization.

752
01:23:19,876 --> 01:23:25,306
And you can see they're there quite vast. So we have processes for identifying.

753
01:23:25,886 --> 01:23:33,746
Different segments that we're looking at addressing with our organization and exchanging partners needs.

754
01:23:33,836 --> 01:23:43,726
So how do we approach that? Developing a brand and convincing those who are out there that you should select the services?

755
01:23:43,736 --> 01:23:48,686
So if it's a health care delivery organization, maybe it's select us as the provider.

756
01:23:48,986 --> 01:23:56,826
If it's a health services organization or a nonprofit, you don't select us as the organization to to give a gift to us.

757
01:23:57,176 --> 01:24:03,836
How do we attract and motivate our associates so the people who work at our organization, are we keeping them engaged?

758
01:24:04,406 --> 01:24:07,166
Uh, the stakeholder relationships outside.

759
01:24:07,496 --> 01:24:15,506
And then, of course, continuous improvement that we might be engaged in, uh, in setting up a marketing plan as goals and evaluating our business.

760
01:24:16,226 --> 01:24:23,906
So what's unique about health care marketing? Well, health services naturally are more challenging to market.

761
01:24:24,566 --> 01:24:32,816
It's hard to market. Um, well, to the point that was given earlier, it's hard to market a vaccine versus an iPhone.

762
01:24:33,946 --> 01:24:41,776
It's difficult to say provide assistance for food insecurity versus purchase this new vehicle.

763
01:24:43,336 --> 01:24:48,886
A different task and demand for health services is typically very rare.

764
01:24:49,366 --> 01:24:52,116
We don't know if we're going to need a particular service.

765
01:24:52,126 --> 01:25:00,346
So Alex, presentation showed us that polio had sort of declined in its prevalence and now here it's being detected again.

766
01:25:00,856 --> 01:25:02,326
But we would have known.

767
01:25:03,366 --> 01:25:09,486
Now I could make the case that the organization ought to be out there trying to keep track so that they're ready when it's happening.

768
01:25:09,486 --> 01:25:14,916
But again, difficult then to make the case that donors will want to give for that effort or what have you.

769
01:25:16,836 --> 01:25:21,756
The user of the service may not be the target of the campaign.

770
01:25:22,086 --> 01:25:26,226
So we saw in the blood bank case with the Red Cross and Carolina Blood Bank.

771
01:25:26,706 --> 01:25:30,866
It's not the individual patient that they were looking to market to.

772
01:25:30,876 --> 01:25:37,926
It was the organization, the hospital, the clinic that they wanted them to use them versus the Red Cross.

773
01:25:39,906 --> 01:25:49,386
Complex products. Each of your presentations have had quite a bit of setup in them in order for us to be able to really engage in dialog.

774
01:25:49,896 --> 01:25:54,276
So now I want you to picture that you're trying to sell a program and your health care organization.

775
01:25:54,606 --> 01:25:58,446
You're trying to boil it down to five words or two words for one word.

776
01:25:59,286 --> 01:26:06,486
If people don't really understand what it is, hard to have one word versus a product where I could just show a picture.

777
01:26:06,696 --> 01:26:12,486
You know, I could just say, buy this. And it's out there and I just see exactly what it is I'm getting.

778
01:26:14,016 --> 01:26:23,326
Um. Difficult to measure what our outcomes are, so hard to then say why you should pay costs or why it's important.

779
01:26:24,856 --> 01:26:29,226
And we have difficulty quantifying so.

780
01:26:29,236 --> 01:26:33,795
So we can say all the time like, yeah, we do better, or Yeah, our quality is better,

781
01:26:33,796 --> 01:26:37,636
yeah, our outcomes are better, but how, how am I going to prove that?

782
01:26:38,026 --> 01:26:41,206
What am I going to say? I don't have a benchmark test.

783
01:26:41,206 --> 01:26:50,716
I don't have a processor that I can compare. You know, the I9 works better than the I7 or, you know, the Mac M1 chip is the fastest one,

784
01:26:50,716 --> 01:26:54,406
but you know, the M2 is going to be even faster, etc., etc.

785
01:26:56,666 --> 01:27:03,535
Now the brand of an organization is a specific term that we use to describe the name, the design,

786
01:27:03,536 --> 01:27:08,906
the symbol, anything that distinguishes or identifies that organization's food or service.

787
01:27:09,326 --> 01:27:12,716
So we attribute qualities to a brand very often.

788
01:27:13,196 --> 01:27:17,996
And organizations are often working to establish a positive brand image.

789
01:27:18,476 --> 01:27:24,686
Now, I want to just go back to an example we gave earlier in the term about the Susan G.

790
01:27:24,686 --> 01:27:30,806
Komen Foundation, because everyone kind of remembered what was there, where were they, what, where they become famous.

791
01:27:30,836 --> 01:27:34,796
Where was their brand appearing in those days long ago?

792
01:27:34,946 --> 01:27:40,586
I don't want anyone to remember, but they all like Yoplait yogurt.

793
01:27:40,676 --> 01:27:44,336
Yes, that's it. Thank you. Thank you. Long, long ago.

794
01:27:44,966 --> 01:27:53,066
Back in 2402. But this was this was something that was at that time, very synonymous.

795
01:27:53,426 --> 01:28:01,376
But the Komen Foundation's logo appeared on radio play label tops, and their brand image was extremely coveted.

796
01:28:01,796 --> 01:28:09,866
They had a great sort of reputation, and they had used their brand to be synonymous with charitable giving.

797
01:28:11,336 --> 01:28:16,086
Then of course, different challenges plagued the organization, and that changed.

798
01:28:16,296 --> 01:28:20,676
And this is why I want to emphasize that it's an intangible asset.

799
01:28:21,156 --> 01:28:26,706
Once the trust is broken down, once that brand is tarnished, it's hard to recover from that.

800
01:28:29,096 --> 01:28:34,706
So why branding important role helps us to identify a is coming from particular source.

801
01:28:35,036 --> 01:28:44,996
It might provide value. We see this very often with health care delivery organizations, especially now come to the Henry Ford Health Clinic for now,

802
01:28:44,996 --> 01:28:55,586
look for, well, how health they come to the, uh, come to, to Michigan Medicine, you know, come to the Cleveland Clinic.

803
01:28:56,186 --> 01:29:00,956
Does anyone remember the advertisement? For now, what will be core will help but uh.

804
01:29:01,316 --> 01:29:13,316
But Vogue the Beaumont ad. So I don't remember that what their question was in those at Michigan do you have a that Christiana.

805
01:29:15,056 --> 01:29:18,955
That's right. Do you have a Beaumont doctor. That was the f do you have a go?

806
01:29:18,956 --> 01:29:23,006
It was always with a deeper voice. Do you have a Beaumont doctor? Always and always.

807
01:29:23,176 --> 01:29:28,855
You know, that sort of someone is having a heart, an episode or they're having a very serious health event.

808
01:29:28,856 --> 01:29:32,816
And, you know, the alerts are going and everything.

809
01:29:32,816 --> 01:29:35,816
And then the voice comes on and goes, Do you have a Beaumont doctor?

810
01:29:36,386 --> 01:29:43,556
And and but but that became a brand. The idea was, if I go to Beaumont, I'll have the answer and I'll get it.

811
01:29:43,646 --> 01:29:45,596
And that that's the competitive advantage.

812
01:29:46,606 --> 01:29:53,956
So you'll see this very often that health systems, health care delivery organizations are going to have their brands over and.

813
01:29:54,966 --> 01:30:00,346
This is not different than other health based nonprofit organizations.

814
01:30:00,366 --> 01:30:04,266
We see it as with organizations that provide for, for example, food access.

815
01:30:04,686 --> 01:30:09,765
You know. We here, sort of we need to provide food.

816
01:30:09,766 --> 01:30:14,836
So we think of, you know, forgotten harvest or we think of Gleaners in southeast Michigan, perhaps.

817
01:30:15,106 --> 01:30:19,366
But these are brands. They're brands that people have become familiar with their organizations.

818
01:30:19,366 --> 01:30:26,116
It's not just that they know the organization very often. It's not that even that someone inside the organization has used their services.

819
01:30:26,116 --> 01:30:29,636
It's just that they've seen that tag. They've seen them in different environments.

820
01:30:29,636 --> 01:30:33,856
They've seen them in the grocery store or in a movie theater or somewhere that they saw.

821
01:30:33,866 --> 01:30:36,946
Now they've associated that as that's where you're supposed to go.

822
01:30:38,586 --> 01:30:44,556
Different then is a trademark. And trademark means that it's a protected brand.

823
01:30:45,096 --> 01:30:51,126
Meaning if I put a team next to it, I registered this brand and now someone can't claim that it is theirs.

824
01:30:51,936 --> 01:30:57,785
You have to have a distinct meaning. You must be used in interstate commerce and you can't have it.

825
01:30:57,786 --> 01:31:02,316
Be confused with other trademarks. Now brand equity.

826
01:31:02,316 --> 01:31:05,285
Here is another concept that I want to just introduce,

827
01:31:05,286 --> 01:31:17,286
which is the perception that a brand in and of itself is going to have a certain set of experiences associated with it so that the brand has a value,

828
01:31:18,396 --> 01:31:23,526
but it's determined by the consumer. So the consumer makes that decision.

829
01:31:23,706 --> 01:31:33,126
I had a good experience at Michigan Medicine, so I'm going to now perceive that as being the superior brand or the superior product.

830
01:31:35,026 --> 01:31:41,446
So these organizations, these nonprofit organizations are very often looking to convince their constituents,

831
01:31:41,446 --> 01:31:50,176
whether that is a patient, whether that is a community member or someone in a particular area to select that organization,

832
01:31:50,956 --> 01:31:59,026
encourage them to engage in the wellness or prevention or whatever part of their mission they're engaged in and then adjust expectations.

833
01:31:59,686 --> 01:32:02,926
And I think that this is an important point for the mission question.

834
01:32:03,406 --> 01:32:06,076
If we have a certain mission, what's our expectation?

835
01:32:06,496 --> 01:32:11,326
Can we expect that it's going to be, for example, an infectious disease, or are we going to eradicate it?

836
01:32:11,806 --> 01:32:16,336
Or are we working toward helping to manage it? Are we working toward reduction?

837
01:32:16,456 --> 01:32:20,346
What's our what's our story? Now.

838
01:32:21,656 --> 01:32:30,956
Not for profits traditionally use branding as a tool to communicate more generally, but they also use it very specifically for fundraising.

839
01:32:31,466 --> 01:32:34,496
And this is very, very key. So when you put a star around it,

840
01:32:34,826 --> 01:32:43,526
which is that how we use our brand and not profit is how we are fundraising and how we are getting into the game game.

841
01:32:44,276 --> 01:32:48,686
So the brand can also though help us maintain a focus on our mission.

842
01:32:49,076 --> 01:32:56,426
It can help to drive a certain issue into the public conversation, move forward.

843
01:32:57,176 --> 01:33:03,266
We can help to galvanize support, and we can think about it through a series of principles.

844
01:33:03,876 --> 01:33:09,026
This is this acronym here Idea of Principles, Integrity, Democracy, Ethics and affinity.

845
01:33:09,386 --> 01:33:18,596
Just to consider, here are some ideas behind not to confuse ideas to concepts, to sort of think about piece of branding.

846
01:33:18,986 --> 01:33:24,776
So integrity. Committing to a mission. Democracy having a participatory process.

847
01:33:25,136 --> 01:33:31,336
So we can create coherence, build trust through transparency and our brand ethics.

848
01:33:31,346 --> 01:33:36,266
So aligning our identity and image with the organization's core values and their culture.

849
01:33:36,656 --> 01:33:43,946
And then affinity. So having the brand support partnerships to showcase each other's core functions.

850
01:33:45,066 --> 01:33:48,156
So we'll have brand integrity inside of an organization.

851
01:33:48,156 --> 01:33:53,256
We'll have brand democracy, brand ethics. But brand affinity becomes very critical for not for profit.

852
01:33:53,916 --> 01:33:57,366
We have to be a good team player. We have to share space and credit.

853
01:33:57,846 --> 01:34:01,596
We have to be collective over, you know, individualism.

854
01:34:01,956 --> 01:34:06,066
And you can think about this in terms of these organizations. Very often you'll see them paired together.

855
01:34:06,486 --> 01:34:10,026
It was a partnership between this organization, this organization and this organization.

856
01:34:10,476 --> 01:34:19,446
And, you know, we're not looking for exclusivity. It's unlike a corporate type marketing strategy where we're going to buy everything out.

857
01:34:19,926 --> 01:34:23,796
We're going to basically say General Motors is the sponsor of this entire weekend.

858
01:34:24,216 --> 01:34:27,816
Ford, shep, ford, toyota, tesla.

859
01:34:27,816 --> 01:34:33,115
None of them are allowed to be here. It's all about gm. Very often with not for profits.

860
01:34:33,116 --> 01:34:36,296
It's about how you are working together.

861
01:34:36,326 --> 01:34:43,826
Why do you think what? Why do you suppose these organizations need to partner versus kind of looking to be exclusive?

862
01:34:44,316 --> 01:34:52,615
What do you think sort of especially in organizations are all the same community what would produce a why why partner

863
01:34:52,616 --> 01:34:57,926
and not try to just sort of say we're the superior and we're going to just kind of put everybody else aside.

864
01:34:59,636 --> 01:35:06,506
What's their motivation, perhaps? Maybe to reach a different population.

865
01:35:07,086 --> 01:35:13,196
Okay. Population. Be efficient at the skill set and efficiency.

866
01:35:13,546 --> 01:35:16,976
But. What do they all need?

867
01:35:18,296 --> 01:35:23,606
Of the money. Right. And if they're all in the same community, where do they need to go get it from?

868
01:35:26,906 --> 01:35:31,916
The same people, all the same people. It's going to be somebody different.

869
01:35:31,926 --> 01:35:39,296
You know, my friend from the food bank across the street is going to get a call from my friend from the food bank down the road.

870
01:35:40,136 --> 01:35:47,606
But it's all the same people. So we can't just sort of say, well, yeah, don't give to that organization because you're going to give to us.

871
01:35:48,176 --> 01:35:52,195
You may not know. They may be involved at the board. They may be involved with history.

872
01:35:52,196 --> 01:35:57,116
You don't know. So that teamwork is very much part of this.

873
01:35:58,436 --> 01:36:03,176
So you can see that branding strategies take very many forms.

874
01:36:04,076 --> 01:36:11,006
You can you can arrange for an organization to have one brand name on all of the different services that the organization offers.

875
01:36:11,306 --> 01:36:14,396
It might be different names on different products.

876
01:36:15,356 --> 01:36:19,856
You might see that an organization will sell its products under the name of another organization.

877
01:36:20,186 --> 01:36:26,766
So we've talked about fiduciary responsibilities, where one organization sits inside of another for financial management purposes.

878
01:36:26,786 --> 01:36:31,046
But you can also see with branding, you know, I might take my service and say, you know what,

879
01:36:31,046 --> 01:36:34,316
I'm going to let the Red Cross run it because they have the better brand identity,

880
01:36:34,406 --> 01:36:39,446
they have the better marketing campaign strategy, better for me not to try to compete with their brand.

881
01:36:40,726 --> 01:36:45,586
Or co-branding. So I'm going to market alongside a different brand name.

882
01:36:46,506 --> 01:36:49,766
So Ronald McDonald House down the road here from us.

883
01:36:49,766 --> 01:36:55,866
And Washington Heights is on the campus of my children's hospital at the University of Michigan.

884
01:36:56,736 --> 01:37:02,256
Rather than try to say, you know, we're going to compete, we're saying let's go together, let's brand together.

885
01:37:04,666 --> 01:37:12,795
Builds trust, which we've talked about. And we have to think about the trust and also the respect, the respect for the brand,

886
01:37:12,796 --> 01:37:18,166
the respect for what it is that we're doing and creating a culture where those

887
01:37:18,166 --> 01:37:22,125
who are looking to consume the organization's services or programs trust them,

888
01:37:22,126 --> 01:37:25,596
but also respect that the organization is acting up.

889
01:37:26,946 --> 01:37:34,476
So brand management is challenging specifically for global organizations because culture is different.

890
01:37:34,776 --> 01:37:37,746
We have different different populations, different places.

891
01:37:38,116 --> 01:37:42,816
Now, Ali has the question at the end of our presentation about sort of what in March of Dimes do,

892
01:37:43,326 --> 01:37:46,865
what could they have done in terms of going more toward an international direction

893
01:37:46,866 --> 01:37:52,626
while things are different in different countries or different continents? So we have to think about that when we're trying to reach out.

894
01:37:52,986 --> 01:38:00,416
What all that investment in campaign style with the poster child concept, all of that maybe works well in the United States.

895
01:38:00,426 --> 01:38:07,686
It may not work in other countries, and therefore it may not be so simple that they will replicate our strategy here in another place.

896
01:38:09,236 --> 01:38:13,226
So established brands may be, as a result, more hesitant to take a risk.

897
01:38:15,056 --> 01:38:21,656
So branding is one component marketing and communications, another pillar of this whole area.

898
01:38:22,196 --> 01:38:25,376
So communication. I'm defined for you here. Transmitting.

899
01:38:25,376 --> 01:38:29,156
Exchanging information. Distinct from communications.

900
01:38:29,156 --> 01:38:32,876
Which is how the messages are encoded. So it's the how.

901
01:38:33,866 --> 01:38:36,656
How they're screened, how they're decoded, how they're acting on.

902
01:38:37,496 --> 01:38:44,096
Disengage from strategic communication so that communication that we undertake in the context of a larger plan.

903
01:38:45,206 --> 01:38:48,296
So I might say I'm going to strategically communicate on this.

904
01:38:48,866 --> 01:38:55,346
So it's a it's a phrase that signals that I'm not going to necessarily share everything I'm sharing.

905
01:38:55,346 --> 01:39:00,356
What's important for the public to know right now so that they understand the message.

906
01:39:00,366 --> 01:39:07,706
So that's distinct from I'm sharing to try and have across purpose, but rather I'm I'm controlling the narrative.

907
01:39:07,736 --> 01:39:10,946
I am I'm shaping how people are going to understand.

908
01:39:11,986 --> 01:39:20,656
So, for example, when President Johnson looked to pass Medicare in 1965, there's a famous taped phone call with one of the members of the Senate,

909
01:39:20,656 --> 01:39:25,756
I believe, where he said, we're not going to talk about how much Medicare is going to cost in 30 years.

910
01:39:26,176 --> 01:39:30,075
We can we can go there, but we're on to 30 years from now.

911
01:39:30,076 --> 01:39:32,186
People are not going to be interested in passing this bill.

912
01:39:32,206 --> 01:39:36,706
We're going to talk about how much it's going to cost right now or right now for five years.

913
01:39:36,856 --> 01:39:40,156
And will that future people find it or figure that out?

914
01:39:40,696 --> 01:39:44,686
And rather we'll focus on now plus five years. That's a strategic communication.

915
01:39:44,996 --> 01:39:49,696
That's not saying we're going to hide it or we're not going to tell anyone or we're not going to share.

916
01:39:49,726 --> 01:39:53,056
We're going to you know, we're going to make it up and say that it's not, you know what it is?

917
01:39:53,596 --> 01:39:59,836
It's saying we're going to choose what we're going to share and how we're going to share it and help people to understand.

918
01:40:00,526 --> 01:40:09,226
And this is really, I think, where public health we've seen examples in the last three or four or five years of challenges with communication,

919
01:40:09,236 --> 01:40:12,796
specifically with these organizations, is challenges with strategic communication.

920
01:40:13,336 --> 01:40:18,496
So is it strategically effective to come out on television and say, don't wear a mask, you don't need one?

921
01:40:19,406 --> 01:40:24,176
Or am I doing all right? Maybe I should frame this message a certain way so that I'm not, you know,

922
01:40:24,236 --> 01:40:32,006
setting myself up if I need to come back in and say a different thing in a month, that people will no longer trust my opinion of me.

923
01:40:33,446 --> 01:40:39,026
And I don't need to call out that specific topic as an example. You know, where we think about strategy is we can make.

924
01:40:40,386 --> 01:40:46,656
Public relations in these organizations is the process where we're building relationships between organizations and their publics.

925
01:40:47,076 --> 01:40:54,366
So it's a separate term. PR is usually the department that's responsible for the outside facing parts of the organization.

926
01:40:54,726 --> 01:41:00,216
The press releases the image, the brand identity, all of that, and then the marketing.

927
01:41:00,396 --> 01:41:03,156
So this is where we're looking to influence behavior.

928
01:41:03,576 --> 01:41:11,766
So PR how the organization is perceived, marketing, influencing behavior are very separate concepts, right?

929
01:41:14,416 --> 01:41:20,625
No, I don't think it's fair to talk about this without acknowledging the barriers that we might have to

930
01:41:20,626 --> 01:41:27,946
communication and some of the principles that would make this process perhaps not inclusive or not equitable.

931
01:41:28,726 --> 01:41:31,906
And so we have several language may be a barrier.

932
01:41:32,446 --> 01:41:39,016
So there's a very famous example of billboards that went up in Belize somewhere in Latin America,

933
01:41:39,016 --> 01:41:42,366
where they went up and it was they translated the word wrong.

934
01:41:42,856 --> 01:41:49,786
It was the phrase was about being embarrassed and the Spanish word, they translated it wrong and it meant pregnant.

935
01:41:50,266 --> 01:41:57,736
So, you know, the billboard went up and it became very embarrassing for the company that was promoting the service.

936
01:41:58,066 --> 01:41:59,896
But the point of this is, is to say,

937
01:42:00,136 --> 01:42:10,756
if you don't have the attention and the focus on creating a culturally competent campaign or thinking carefully about who your audience is,

938
01:42:10,996 --> 01:42:14,806
you may find that you'll have a mis mistranslated sign,

939
01:42:15,076 --> 01:42:22,756
or you may have a phrase or an image or picture something that doesn't really resonate with the community that you're that you're trying to speak to.

940
01:42:24,446 --> 01:42:26,936
We have to think about where people come from.

941
01:42:27,086 --> 01:42:33,566
They're coming from different cultures, backgrounds, and the communication strategies need to adapt and reflect that diversity.

942
01:42:34,286 --> 01:42:42,176
There may be resistance to change. So many might feel their employees inside the organization of its internal promotion.

943
01:42:42,476 --> 01:42:48,956
You know that's keeping us as opposed safer individuals might filter what they hear they might reject a new idea.

944
01:42:51,146 --> 01:42:57,296
But it may play a role in how we're communicating. And then we may have emotional danger zones.

945
01:42:57,456 --> 01:43:01,646
So cruelty in the guise of being honest, being impatient.

946
01:43:01,946 --> 01:43:07,286
Blame, sarcasm. These are all communication styles that may take place jokes.

947
01:43:07,676 --> 01:43:13,346
These are things that sort of come out that if ask ourselves, you know, is it achieving our objective?

948
01:43:13,886 --> 01:43:20,606
Are we getting through if we're making a joke to try and use humor to attract someone to use our service?

949
01:43:20,936 --> 01:43:25,375
Is that something that resonates with everyone or is it making certain parts of the population

950
01:43:25,376 --> 01:43:31,876
feel isolated or somehow they're not part of the joke and now not interested in being part of our.

951
01:43:32,076 --> 01:43:40,626
Our brand for our. So we have to create adequate preparation for these campaigns.

952
01:43:40,646 --> 01:43:47,966
We have to think about direct language. But most important, and I want to just highlight this here is our listening and sensitivity components.

953
01:43:48,476 --> 01:43:57,806
So thinking about how we react, engaging and focusing through active listening and then accepting and supporting through reflective listening.

954
01:43:59,336 --> 01:44:05,666
The American Medical Association has a code of ethics that it puts out for health communication specifically.

955
01:44:06,656 --> 01:44:15,656
And you can see it here specifically focused on how physicians remain vigilant on direct to consumer advertising, not promoting false expectations.

956
01:44:15,986 --> 01:44:21,836
But you can extrapolate it further to say, in health care, specifically because of uncertainty,

957
01:44:22,046 --> 01:44:28,786
there needs to be a certain sense or sensibility of being deliberate about our communication type,

958
01:44:29,246 --> 01:44:33,176
you know, not promising something that we don't necessarily know we can deliver on.

959
01:44:33,806 --> 01:44:36,926
We can clock the processor speed on a phone.

960
01:44:37,616 --> 01:44:43,016
We can measure how much speed something takes to, you know, phone available.

961
01:44:43,586 --> 01:44:49,645
We can't necessarily. Aside from being able to generate evidence in the literature about a particular procedure,

962
01:44:49,646 --> 01:44:56,046
we can't necessarily quantify or say this particular service that our organization is doing is going to achieve X.

963
01:44:56,796 --> 01:45:00,506
We have to be careful about how we're framing things so as to not overcrowd.

964
01:45:02,746 --> 01:45:11,446
Now, many of the organizations we've been talking about have had to respond to crises in the last number of years, especially during COVID.

965
01:45:11,746 --> 01:45:14,086
And that's the role of the media relations department.

966
01:45:14,596 --> 01:45:22,966
So these departments are usually looking for ways to prevent events that are going to draw investigation.

967
01:45:23,596 --> 01:45:29,326
So the Kidney Foundation case, the media relations team at the organization, as they heard or what we do,

968
01:45:29,336 --> 01:45:34,606
that they probably would be like, okay, no, no, no, no, this is going to be impossible for us to untangle.

969
01:45:34,996 --> 01:45:37,696
From a PR perspective or a trust perspective.

970
01:45:38,056 --> 01:45:44,276
So we need to get far away from this kind of behavior because forget about it a bit questionably with ethics.

971
01:45:44,296 --> 01:45:47,646
I'm speaking as the media relations you forget about, especially with ethics.

972
01:45:47,686 --> 01:45:52,576
We're going to have a real hard time sorting this out when it's finished. So what are we going to do about that?

973
01:45:53,206 --> 01:45:55,276
So they're usually working to get ahead of things,

974
01:45:55,396 --> 01:46:03,436
to try and make sure that they're not in a situation where they have to explain something that is not going to be particularly clear for the public.

975
01:46:04,306 --> 01:46:13,276
But sometimes they have to. So strong media relations are often linked with a strong branding program.

976
01:46:13,696 --> 01:46:20,986
Being able to say, you know, we have a particular code, we have a particular set of values and we adhere to them.

977
01:46:21,706 --> 01:46:28,306
But we also have to keep in mind that every organization is going to always, always need some kind of a crisis communication.

978
01:46:29,056 --> 01:46:33,126
Something goes wrong. They have nothing to do with anything you did.

979
01:46:33,636 --> 01:46:34,626
If something goes wrong,

980
01:46:34,866 --> 01:46:40,836
someone that you didn't know about starts doing something that you didn't realize was happening and the organization has to respond.

981
01:46:41,496 --> 01:46:47,796
So there's quite a bit here at the University of Michigan in the last couple of years that there were a lot of crises within the organization,

982
01:46:48,156 --> 01:46:54,066
and it was the role of the communications team to really go out and try to address these things,

983
01:46:54,186 --> 01:46:58,116
not just through a press release or a statement, but what is the actual plan.

984
01:46:58,476 --> 01:47:04,416
So communications becomes central to how we address these types of challenges.

985
01:47:05,986 --> 01:47:08,986
With all things in organizations. We have to think about evaluation.

986
01:47:09,256 --> 01:47:16,906
So we want to keep in mind focusing on continuous improvement, how we quantitatively measure performance,

987
01:47:17,416 --> 01:47:21,436
what our scorecards will be to evaluate the external relationships that we have,

988
01:47:21,946 --> 01:47:29,446
and then how we're going to evaluate satisfaction and then sort of give us context to those different quantitative measures that we have.

989
01:47:29,956 --> 01:47:36,856
So what I want to kind of leave you with for today, as we're sort of thinking about this, this particular area,

990
01:47:37,426 --> 01:47:43,666
is the importance of keeping in mind that the communication strategy that is being used is central to

991
01:47:44,026 --> 01:47:52,036
how the organization starts to make efforts toward its operational plans or its programs or service.

992
01:47:52,106 --> 01:48:00,856
So in your in your paper or in your assignment assignment, too, I ask you to think about the marketing communications aspects of your program.

993
01:48:01,336 --> 01:48:06,626
But in your third assignment, which I will set up next week here,

994
01:48:07,066 --> 01:48:11,895
and I'll ask you to also think about these strategic objectives and keep this in mind as

995
01:48:11,896 --> 01:48:16,806
you're thinking about a five year strategic plan for the organization that correct questions.

996
01:48:19,276 --> 01:48:23,746
How about a ten minute break? Yeah. And we'll do that.

997
01:48:23,766 --> 01:48:32,645
And then we're going to do our case back here at 609 to do so.

998
01:48:32,646 --> 01:48:32,784
But I think that, you know, folks, because I used to have that is really I say, you know, it's okay.

999
01:48:33,841 --> 01:48:37,531
Welcome back. We are on to our presentation for today.

1000
01:48:37,551 --> 01:48:46,131
I'll turn it over to our age group that graciously let me know that we're going to have some interactive components of today's presentation.

1001
01:48:46,641 --> 01:48:57,061
So as the sun sets on Tuesday, November 1st, we will be looking into that category itself.

1002
01:48:57,351 --> 01:49:05,060
Right as the sun sets on November 30 will be lively and using our platform for a great group,

1003
01:49:05,061 --> 01:49:18,501
looking at a Region three one day to discuss our whole proposal for the network and just to jump right into the presentation,

1004
01:49:18,501 --> 01:49:26,421
we were assigned the Sleeping Bear Jones, which is a National Lake story that was established in 1970 in the lower tip of Michigan.

1005
01:49:26,931 --> 01:49:35,301
It's approximately 7199 acres, with a population of approximately 1.1 billion as of 2014.

1006
01:49:35,931 --> 01:49:40,551
And it's 50,000 acres of coastline with dunes that are only 400 feet high.

1007
01:49:41,481 --> 01:49:47,751
I've been there. I really like it. I recommend it anywhere and everywhere you go.

1008
01:49:48,321 --> 01:49:56,361
And never mind. What was the most intense part through going up and down those do going up that you don't

1009
01:49:56,361 --> 01:50:00,770
realize like how much traction like it's so hard and how much resistance you have to go up.

1010
01:50:00,771 --> 01:50:06,531
Sand Yeah. I feel like the sand that keeps getting in your shoes too and makes it increasingly harder.

1011
01:50:06,861 --> 01:50:11,241
I try doing it barefoot wants to sit here. No, no, no, no.

1012
01:50:11,631 --> 01:50:14,661
That's great. Through all the sun just goes right on it. Okay. Sorry.

1013
01:50:14,661 --> 01:50:21,581
I want to keep going. Excellent. Shifting over to the case, just a little background on the Special Hope Network.

1014
01:50:21,591 --> 01:50:27,861
So it was founded by Eric and Holly Nelson in 2010 and it became a certified five on C three organization.

1015
01:50:28,341 --> 01:50:34,281
It was founded in Lusaka, Zambia, and is dedicated to providing holistic therapy services to children with disabilities.

1016
01:50:34,881 --> 01:50:40,461
And the Nelson's decided on Zambia because that's where the greatest need for children with disabilities was.

1017
01:50:40,821 --> 01:50:41,991
And after some analysis,

1018
01:50:41,991 --> 01:50:49,880
they determined that they needed 20 to 30 more centers or 2 to 3 more centers per year to adequately support the needs for children with disabilities.

1019
01:50:49,881 --> 01:50:54,891
And Zambia and their target population, just to name a few,

1020
01:50:54,891 --> 01:51:00,141
is individuals who value people with intellectual disabilities, family members who have a child with a disability.

1021
01:51:00,141 --> 01:51:02,571
And Special Olympics families and volunteers.

1022
01:51:05,511 --> 01:51:11,751
The mission of SDH and as described in the reading, is to provide services to children with special needs and their families.

1023
01:51:12,081 --> 01:51:15,441
There's also a more precise definition of the mission on their website,

1024
01:51:15,441 --> 01:51:21,080
which is described as bringing glory to God by creating a world where all kids are valued and impacting communities,

1025
01:51:21,081 --> 01:51:23,631
by improving care for kids with intellectual disabilities.

1026
01:51:23,871 --> 01:51:30,981
And that's done by equipping families and caregivers to provide these children with a loving home, holistic health care and exceptional education.

1027
01:51:33,801 --> 01:51:39,441
As we know, SB ten was the first major presence of this type of service and transition into a completely unserved market,

1028
01:51:39,861 --> 01:51:46,970
which was one of their primary challenges and a few other challenges they face were the lack of other local service providers and partnerships,

1029
01:51:46,971 --> 01:51:52,431
educational infrastructure, public awareness of services and lack of government support and services.

1030
01:51:55,461 --> 01:52:02,090
The situation we identified in the text as an evaluation, more specifically an evaluation of the financial sustainability of each,

1031
01:52:02,091 --> 01:52:05,810
and so could try and overcome the financial challenges they face.

1032
01:52:05,811 --> 01:52:11,361
And what countries and strategies could they adopt to align with their mission and culture to advance our organization?

1033
01:52:11,871 --> 01:52:18,980
Also, looking at the figure below, we can see that their expenses are increasing overall as time progresses.

1034
01:52:18,981 --> 01:52:23,211
So that's something that they have to determine how to navigate to become financially sustainable.

1035
01:52:25,921 --> 01:52:33,451
Moving on, there were additional obstacles encountered and need to overcome so each and work to encourage attendance

1036
01:52:33,451 --> 01:52:38,611
since there was a lack of consistent attendance since families had certain financial obligations.

1037
01:52:39,301 --> 01:52:46,051
They also implemented pastor workshops to mitigate bias and misperception of special needs children through shared religion and religious practices.

1038
01:52:46,501 --> 01:52:53,341
They also implemented traditional healer workshops which educated healers to reduce harm to children through nonstandard medical practices.

1039
01:52:53,701 --> 01:52:56,010
And finally, they implemented medical clinic training,

1040
01:52:56,011 --> 01:53:02,911
which provided Zambian physicians with medical information and education about the medical and medical needs of children at special needs.

1041
01:53:06,311 --> 01:53:13,481
So as I mentioned, SAHM did face some financial challenges and they also have current practices in place to overcome these challenges.

1042
01:53:13,571 --> 01:53:21,491
So they began local fundraising through a door to door approach to raise awareness of community engagement and also engender good well.

1043
01:53:22,031 --> 01:53:23,531
They also had child sponsorship,

1044
01:53:23,531 --> 01:53:29,561
which was an important source of revenue for us and which provided food for children and also covering other overhead expenses as well.

1045
01:53:30,551 --> 01:53:35,380
They explored grant writing, but they had challenges finding the right fit for a grant that would be best

1046
01:53:35,381 --> 01:53:39,281
for their organization because grants required lots of labor and attention,

1047
01:53:39,281 --> 01:53:46,721
which was lacking. And they also had other approaches such as teaching founders, offering training and to our fundraising.

1048
01:53:53,321 --> 01:53:57,491
Some questions that we consider when analyzing the case in terms of determining the best

1049
01:53:57,491 --> 01:54:01,391
financial strategy for advancing the organization and corresponding with their mission.

1050
01:54:01,751 --> 01:54:08,291
Those are just listed there or read them all. So what are the long term goals of each and do they want to work in zombie a long term?

1051
01:54:08,301 --> 01:54:13,571
What does it mean to adequately support the needs of Zambia? Can they be successful at just their two centers?

1052
01:54:13,901 --> 01:54:18,221
Are there any areas where they could cut costs without harming the functioning of the organization?

1053
01:54:18,521 --> 01:54:24,521
So they prepared a backup plan for the challenges they anticipated. What does SAHM have the capacity to take on at this time?

1054
01:54:24,791 --> 01:54:27,851
Has S.H. and tried something similar in the past? What was the outcome?

1055
01:54:28,211 --> 01:54:32,111
And finally, which options are most conscious and respectful of the community?

1056
01:54:32,381 --> 01:54:36,221
So now we'll pass it over to Liz to discuss the possible solutions portion.

1057
01:54:36,761 --> 01:54:40,211
Yeah. So we decided it was an evaluation because as we were reading through the case,

1058
01:54:40,211 --> 01:54:47,470
there were a handful of different solutions and options that they came up with that might help them to diversify their fundraising efforts.

1059
01:54:47,471 --> 01:54:52,931
Because one of the main things they talked about was how essentially all of their income at this point is coming from US based donors,

1060
01:54:52,931 --> 01:54:55,931
and they've kind of tapped out what they're able to get from that at this point.

1061
01:54:55,931 --> 01:54:59,791
They need funds coming from other places and they want to make it a core part of their business, they said.

1062
01:55:00,851 --> 01:55:06,191
So we're going to quickly run through what a handful of those options were, and then we're going to have a little group activity.

1063
01:55:06,191 --> 01:55:09,761
That's what we're trying to create through this so that you're also conscious to be able to talk about this.

1064
01:55:10,901 --> 01:55:14,810
So one of the first solutions was to certify their training program,

1065
01:55:14,811 --> 01:55:19,601
and they talked about how the Zambian government will actually subsidize the salaries of

1066
01:55:19,601 --> 01:55:23,441
teachers that work in the educational facilities that actually meet specific requirements.

1067
01:55:24,731 --> 01:55:33,731
So that's the first option. Second option solution number two is to increase the number of U.S. based grants that they're applying for.

1068
01:55:33,731 --> 01:55:38,711
So as I could continue applying for larger grants, you know, like I was saying,

1069
01:55:38,711 --> 01:55:42,701
they've done a few in the past, but they could continue trying to get bigger, better grants.

1070
01:55:46,031 --> 01:55:54,880
Solution three is tourist fundraising. So having a travel program where tourists can come in, they volunteer with SAHM, provide services,

1071
01:55:54,881 --> 01:55:59,121
but also glad, you know, have these experiences in Zambia, in the community, you know,

1072
01:55:59,141 --> 01:56:06,821
seeing other touristy things like a solution for then with opening a for profit center that they would dub

1073
01:56:06,821 --> 01:56:12,371
a resource center as opposed to the community care centers that are the ones they've been working with.

1074
01:56:13,721 --> 01:56:15,821
So these centers would be for families,

1075
01:56:15,821 --> 01:56:22,661
they can actually pay for care as opposed to the families they've been serving who do not have the funds to be able to afford care for their children.

1076
01:56:26,681 --> 01:56:31,001
So our group activity and we can kind of go back to these people need to see them again.

1077
01:56:31,061 --> 01:56:37,931
But if you want to get into the small groups of three or four, just talk with yourselves about, you know, these four solutions.

1078
01:56:38,351 --> 01:56:44,351
You know how you would rank those or maybe even combine them to kind of create your plan moving forward.

1079
01:56:44,351 --> 01:56:50,351
And then we'll have each group share out and we'll go over the kind of our thoughts, what we read from the case and how we thought about it.

1080
01:56:51,221 --> 01:56:55,071
All right. We'll have about maybe like 5 minutes for people to chat really quick.

1081
01:56:57,971 --> 01:57:03,741
All right. Break into groups energized, you might think.

1082
01:57:04,771 --> 01:57:08,140
Oh, yeah, I feel like you forget.

1083
01:57:08,141 --> 01:57:18,911
I'm not charged. I have nothing else to go on.

1084
01:57:20,111 --> 01:57:28,111
I think I will say this. I got the most people have never done.

1085
01:57:28,261 --> 01:57:44,201
I don't know. Okay, so you just got to make sure I think I should do it.

1086
01:57:44,201 --> 01:57:50,081
I would like how you do it to us.

1087
01:57:52,091 --> 01:57:57,541
I think it's really to show you what we're like.

1088
01:57:57,641 --> 01:58:00,851
Oh, yeah. Sorry. I thought I did it when I started.

1089
01:58:06,161 --> 01:58:17,081
I just want to tell what you what you're talking about.

1090
01:58:17,081 --> 01:58:47,751
So let's take six countries like Syria and then I think that's what I like that because I know.

1091
01:58:47,981 --> 01:59:03,011
But how would you like to plunge into the first stage of you?

1092
01:59:03,011 --> 01:59:07,391
Like, you know, Mexico's sure have to do.

1093
01:59:08,161 --> 01:59:12,251
That's how I mean, that's how I feel about that. Makes you feel like an outsider.

1094
01:59:12,251 --> 01:59:21,091
Yeah. Yeah. Right. So we're we're going three your ranking where you can figure out the combination that you think over to us.

1095
01:59:22,181 --> 01:59:28,241
So when we're done with this, I'm going to call on each group. I want to hear your concern because we have a combo.

1096
01:59:28,301 --> 01:59:47,831
I it as I say, I usually I just have like the left side is not my favorite.

1097
01:59:51,701 --> 02:00:18,601
Yeah. I just don't want to say anything, to be honest with you about something that I know that I was like,

1098
02:00:22,961 --> 02:00:31,871
how many do you think that this could bring this group here range?

1099
02:00:35,891 --> 02:00:49,391
So like, I don't know that's not everyone's going to be even, but it can be also just like you said.

1100
02:00:53,891 --> 02:01:01,531
Yeah. I mean, I feel like if you are the first.

1101
02:01:01,551 --> 02:01:08,051
Yes. And then you bring in somebody.

1102
02:01:08,051 --> 02:01:16,811
Yeah, that's a good idea. Some people, like every group, have a representative.

1103
02:01:16,811 --> 02:01:21,971
That would be a speaker for your group. Okay. Yes.

1104
02:01:23,471 --> 02:01:27,881
Okay. All right. So you're going to do this.

1105
02:01:28,571 --> 02:01:34,631
Someone else in your group is introduced or your representative is and they'll give the ranking.

1106
02:01:35,261 --> 02:01:38,410
Okay. All right. So give everyone a chance.

1107
02:01:38,411 --> 02:01:41,890
You got at least two of you got to be all right.

1108
02:01:41,891 --> 02:01:44,921
So why is it was very matter of all right.

1109
02:01:45,461 --> 02:01:49,601
This is so funny.

1110
02:01:51,161 --> 02:01:59,051
So we decided that the two things we would like to meld together is applying for grants.

1111
02:01:59,291 --> 02:02:05,170
Although it seems daunting and somewhat resource intensive, initially,

1112
02:02:05,171 --> 02:02:12,640
I think it could be that it could be a good opportunity for them to have a better face for at least hopefully a few years

1113
02:02:12,641 --> 02:02:18,401
that could help sustain them as they kind of continue strategizing and seeing what long term solutions they could have.

1114
02:02:19,211 --> 02:02:22,601
And then we wanted to pair this with the.

1115
02:02:24,431 --> 02:02:33,611
The idea of doing the term of what you actually had called that first one on the left about the subsidies for salaries for teachers.

1116
02:02:33,611 --> 02:02:46,961
Yeah. So if you have a certified training program that helps to really continue the investment in the local community

1117
02:02:46,961 --> 02:02:55,571
and supporting the individuals there as opposed to some other things that might be a little bit more attractive.

1118
02:02:55,811 --> 02:03:07,631
And, you know, I think that there can be issues with trying to stay to their mission if trying to do a for profit side of things.

1119
02:03:10,671 --> 02:03:14,221
All right. Thank you to that group. How about another one?

1120
02:03:15,161 --> 02:03:18,461
Through these groups someone introduced over this period the speaker.

1121
02:03:18,791 --> 02:03:22,841
Okay, this is our replacement.

1122
02:03:25,601 --> 02:03:36,391
So we decided that the travel program and the grants are important and that combining the subsidies,

1123
02:03:36,401 --> 02:03:41,801
our principal teachers with the community care center, you know,

1124
02:03:41,831 --> 02:03:46,331
it's even though there might be issues with like mission or whatever,

1125
02:03:46,331 --> 02:03:50,381
maybe it seems like to be a separate organization altogether that could can money into that.

1126
02:03:50,771 --> 02:03:55,361
And one thing you talked about was ensuring that if they did create a for profit organization,

1127
02:03:55,721 --> 02:03:58,891
ensuring that local community members were the ones to do right,

1128
02:03:58,931 --> 02:04:06,941
that are people people so that everything from that organization's for profit

1129
02:04:06,941 --> 02:04:12,431
organizations going back into the community through the nonprofit organization.

1130
02:04:12,911 --> 02:04:16,501
And then also one of their biggest expenses was salaries.

1131
02:04:16,501 --> 02:04:23,261
So it's now kind of got by having those government subsidized salaries and then using

1132
02:04:23,261 --> 02:04:27,791
the money they're making to subsidize for other expenses that would allow them to grow.

1133
02:04:32,181 --> 02:04:42,660
All right. Thank you. Thanks, Drew. And so the way we ranked our overall was the first one.

1134
02:04:42,661 --> 02:04:46,831
Our favorite was the subsidized salaries. Then next we said for profit.

1135
02:04:47,191 --> 02:04:55,661
Third was applied to grants and lasted hopefully never to response but similar to like no it.

1136
02:04:55,771 --> 02:05:00,241
But I think for we because of interchange like the grants and paying for services.

1137
02:05:00,661 --> 02:05:06,411
But we ones that like applying for grants is difficult and arduous until like, you know,

1138
02:05:07,021 --> 02:05:13,501
the likelihood of them thinking that the art of them getting grants that could sustain them might be limited.

1139
02:05:14,521 --> 02:05:17,731
But then also our other thought for like paying for services like, you know,

1140
02:05:18,691 --> 02:05:21,771
brought up like would it be unfair for some people to pay and others not to use that?

1141
02:05:21,781 --> 02:05:28,291
Might it be better to have like a sliding scale based on like incomes or other factors?

1142
02:05:30,031 --> 02:05:33,541
But yeah, overall we like to subsidize salaries the those and think that's the most like sustainable.

1143
02:05:35,791 --> 02:05:40,691
If they can get. All right.

1144
02:05:40,961 --> 02:05:49,031
Thanks. And if we have any more room to contribute here, is that obvious?

1145
02:05:49,051 --> 02:05:56,851
Okay. Okay. I'm presenting David Fuller, who is our expert on developing recommendations.

1146
02:05:57,811 --> 02:06:05,341
So we read, we put our brains together and we recommended that they say go with the number one is saving government and

1147
02:06:06,151 --> 02:06:13,021
subsidize thousands of offers for number two said it's a chance to continue to apply for larger grants.

1148
02:06:13,771 --> 02:06:23,580
Number three, we said for the travel programs. And before we set about the community transit system and for the subsidize salaries,

1149
02:06:23,581 --> 02:06:29,701
you believe that it was I said it in the paper that they meet those educational requirements.

1150
02:06:30,061 --> 02:06:36,631
So that's a checkbox there. And then they're able to offer those work and the salary and the teachers because of that.

1151
02:06:38,741 --> 02:06:44,031
Thanks. And then I think we got our last group back here. I'm introducing Christiana, right?

1152
02:06:44,041 --> 02:06:47,761
So we ranked ours subsidies first.

1153
02:06:48,091 --> 02:06:59,991
Second we said the for profit center, um, third grant and then for the tourist program, uh, basically because of what everyone else is.

1154
02:07:02,041 --> 02:07:10,171
So I find it interesting that tourist program is really low ranked, which raise your hand if your group that ranked that as number four or three.

1155
02:07:11,251 --> 02:07:15,271
Yeah. Why don't we not like that one. Um.

1156
02:07:15,791 --> 02:07:19,531
You talk to in the discussion? Well, um. Probably would. Okay.

1157
02:07:19,621 --> 02:07:23,731
All right. Hold that thought. Don't, don't, don't, don't, don't. Don't put a pin in that one.

1158
02:07:23,941 --> 02:07:28,321
I'm going to stop talking. Oh, sorry. That's okay with the girls.

1159
02:07:28,711 --> 02:07:33,450
I think. Next slide. Okay. So, yeah, we'll just kind of quickly run through.

1160
02:07:33,451 --> 02:07:38,101
I think you all got some of the things that we had thought about and, you know, that were stated in the case.

1161
02:07:38,611 --> 02:07:43,471
So some of the pros of the certification on the training program, I'll be able to offer more competitive salaries.

1162
02:07:44,341 --> 02:07:47,041
And, you know, it should free up some funds to help with other things.

1163
02:07:47,431 --> 02:07:52,611
And like David was saying, it's a program that they're pretty sure they already qualify for it.

1164
02:07:52,621 --> 02:07:57,091
So there shouldn't be a lot of extra work to do. So, like you said, essentially a checked box for them.

1165
02:07:57,381 --> 02:08:04,021
Um, you know, the con is, you know, alone. This probably isn't big enough to solve the entire issue of, you know, diversifying their funds.

1166
02:08:07,891 --> 02:08:13,861
So then the US space grants some proposal that they do had they've had some prior success.

1167
02:08:14,221 --> 02:08:21,271
But is it then smaller grants. Oh, we were thinking that, you know, this might be more there offered fewer opportunities for, you know,

1168
02:08:21,271 --> 02:08:28,001
larger funds with a more known process for them, as opposed to maybe opening the new, you know, resource center to receive funding.

1169
02:08:28,021 --> 02:08:31,591
Those are all kind of bigger things that might need a little extra brainpower.

1170
02:08:32,271 --> 02:08:39,240
But some of the cons that also got discussed. You only need an audit if they're doing larger grants are going to need additional labor for success.

1171
02:08:39,241 --> 02:08:43,050
They themselves and their staff currently don't have a lot of experience with grants,

1172
02:08:43,051 --> 02:08:46,561
so they probably need someone who is specialized in grant writing in this process.

1173
02:08:47,401 --> 02:08:52,230
They also talked about in the case, it's kind of a feedback loop where you have to be getting these larger and larger grants.

1174
02:08:52,231 --> 02:08:58,560
To keep getting larger grants. They need to see success with more maybe medium sized grants and delivering on

1175
02:08:58,561 --> 02:09:01,711
those first before they're actually going to be able to get these larger funds.

1176
02:09:01,721 --> 02:09:09,661
So it might be a slower process. They also brought up that they might get trapped in sort of an unstable grant cycle where, you know, you get a grant.

1177
02:09:09,661 --> 02:09:12,841
Great. And then you don't get the next one or something doesn't come through.

1178
02:09:13,681 --> 02:09:18,420
You know, they talked about where the like the financial guy they brought in had experiences

1179
02:09:18,421 --> 02:09:22,981
where people had to get fired based on a grant cycle and stuff like that. So that would obviously be a challenge.

1180
02:09:23,971 --> 02:09:29,361
That's. Following the terrorist fundraising, everyone's favorite.

1181
02:09:30,081 --> 02:09:35,151
So this is really a pro and a con artist will stop and help from volunteers.

1182
02:09:35,161 --> 02:09:40,461
So like, yes, there's more bodies, but the cause of that is none of them are trained to do anything.

1183
02:09:40,461 --> 02:09:44,381
So how useful are they actually going to be pose?

1184
02:09:44,871 --> 02:09:49,700
One of the things they thought about is that it might lead to more individual donors and institutional sponsorships.

1185
02:09:49,701 --> 02:09:54,230
So, you know, if people come and do this and have a great time, they'll go back to the US and talk a lot about it.

1186
02:09:54,231 --> 02:09:57,921
And you know, individual donors might say, Oh, that's something I want to donate to.

1187
02:09:57,921 --> 02:10:01,160
Or they had a story about another organization who someone went back to their

1188
02:10:01,161 --> 02:10:04,451
church and then the church decided they were going to sponsor the organization.

1189
02:10:04,461 --> 02:10:11,480
So they're hoping for that. Cons A large administrative burden, like as part of creating a program like this,

1190
02:10:11,481 --> 02:10:17,121
they're going to have to figure out all of the logistics of where these tourists stay, you know, what they eat, where they travel, all of that.

1191
02:10:17,121 --> 02:10:20,691
And that just feels like a lot of work and they're going to have to organize all of that.

1192
02:10:22,071 --> 02:10:25,931
They're also not to figure out advertising this in the U.S. like how do you create a program and then,

1193
02:10:26,161 --> 02:10:29,451
you know, actually get people to it to kind of see a payoff.

1194
02:10:30,741 --> 02:10:33,980
And then, I mean, not even just having untrained volunteers,

1195
02:10:33,981 --> 02:10:37,581
but I think there's a lot of reasons why this would be viewed confidently in the community.

1196
02:10:38,991 --> 02:10:47,301
And we'll talk some more about that later. So then solution number four, opening the for profit resource center.

1197
02:10:47,601 --> 02:10:52,070
So pro is, you know, they're still going to be serving families in need, but they might be able to make some money off of it.

1198
02:10:52,071 --> 02:10:58,791
They had talked about, you know, the idea came from a family that had the funds to be able to pay for services and was willing to do that.

1199
02:11:00,441 --> 02:11:04,821
They did talk about also how donors might view this as a move moving towards self-sufficiency.

1200
02:11:05,211 --> 02:11:10,941
I think that kind of fits with the piece of them, like really moving towards having fundraising as a core of their business model.

1201
02:11:11,031 --> 02:11:16,581
Like they talked about some of the cons, it's going to require some capacity to get this off the ground.

1202
02:11:17,391 --> 02:11:20,921
Looking at the pro forma that they had written up and everything, you know,

1203
02:11:20,931 --> 02:11:24,651
there are going to be in the red for that as they kind of get this functioning.

1204
02:11:25,881 --> 02:11:29,091
Another issue there might be as people viewing this is off mission because they

1205
02:11:29,091 --> 02:11:33,891
are profiting off of it as opposed to offering free services as has been kind of,

1206
02:11:34,011 --> 02:11:37,811
you know, a big part of the mission so far. Let's.

1207
02:11:39,821 --> 02:11:45,341
So it was interesting listening to everyone's plan. So our recommendation, we did a combination of things like everyone else.

1208
02:11:45,341 --> 02:11:49,211
We did want to certify the teaching program because that felt like a very simple first step.

1209
02:11:50,711 --> 02:11:55,750
We decided that we did want to try to increase grant applications that felt like it

1210
02:11:55,751 --> 02:11:58,961
might be a hold over for a bit until they're able to work on some other things.

1211
02:11:59,321 --> 02:12:04,390
And we also talked about having, you know, a strategic plan and figuring out ways to evaluate stuff to make sure that they're

1212
02:12:04,391 --> 02:12:08,291
actually trying to track progress and see what is and isn't working as they go forward.

1213
02:12:08,831 --> 02:12:16,121
So let's kind of tier one and then, you know, tier two and they just continue working on that, diversify their funding, hopefully get larger grants.

1214
02:12:16,121 --> 02:12:19,091
And then after they've hit a certain threshold that they can determine,

1215
02:12:19,571 --> 02:12:23,081
then they'll hopefully eventually have the capacity to open a for profit resource

1216
02:12:23,081 --> 02:12:26,351
center and move towards that self-sufficiency that they were talking about.

1217
02:12:27,881 --> 02:12:30,371
Which large grant are you thinking they should go after?

1218
02:12:30,731 --> 02:12:41,561
That's a great question and something I would have to follow up on after we can open it up to our colleagues to tell us when we're ready.

1219
02:12:44,741 --> 02:12:49,751
So, you know, we also wanted to think about possible equity concerns with our recommendations.

1220
02:12:50,801 --> 02:12:57,551
So looping back to the instability of the grant cycles, not only might that create instability for people actually working at the nonprofit,

1221
02:12:57,911 --> 02:13:01,931
they're also might be inconsistencies in service that they're able to provide for people,

1222
02:13:01,931 --> 02:13:06,550
you know, if they have a large income and they're kind of basing services and expanding around that,

1223
02:13:06,551 --> 02:13:08,951
and then all of a sudden they don't have that, that's problematic.

1224
02:13:10,591 --> 02:13:18,181
Again, having a for profit center might take away the focus on those most in need and those that can't pay for services.

1225
02:13:19,351 --> 02:13:29,781
Next. So thinking about what extra evidence and information, what we need to really figure out how to implement this and do it right.

1226
02:13:30,381 --> 02:13:35,591
We would be curious to know more about their grant application history. We want to know what are they applied for before?

1227
02:13:35,601 --> 02:13:38,751
What if they had had what have they had success with in the past?

1228
02:13:39,351 --> 02:13:46,101
And that can help us think about what might work moving forward. We also want to make sure we actually know the specifications for the teaching

1229
02:13:46,101 --> 02:13:49,580
program because they've said that they think they check all of those boxes,

1230
02:13:49,581 --> 02:13:53,511
but we need to make sure that they actually meet those standards and other standards that they're not meeting.

1231
02:13:53,511 --> 02:13:58,941
What do they need to do to get there at this point? And then will that still be a useful, efficient way to do things?

1232
02:14:00,081 --> 02:14:04,191
And then in terms of the strategic plan, we just want to know what have they done for assessment in the past?

1233
02:14:04,191 --> 02:14:07,760
And then think a lot about what are going to be actually useful measures of success,

1234
02:14:07,761 --> 02:14:12,561
how are they evaluating and how is that going to be helpful moving forward? Thanks.

1235
02:14:13,421 --> 02:14:18,211
All right. So in terms of implementation for sort of that tier one, you know,

1236
02:14:18,331 --> 02:14:23,730
they're going to probably need to hire a grants writer, you know, specialized staff to work on this stuff.

1237
02:14:23,731 --> 02:14:30,001
And, you know, as they hopefully get larger and larger grants, they'll need to have more people on board to work on that.

1238
02:14:31,531 --> 02:14:37,800
They need to actually write the strategic plan. We talked about how they could evaluate it maybe monthly for the first six months.

1239
02:14:37,801 --> 02:14:44,191
And then, you know, as things are kind of progressing maybe every six months instead of monthly and then,

1240
02:14:44,191 --> 02:14:47,761
you know, just checking any extra boxes that they have to certify the program.

1241
02:14:50,081 --> 02:14:55,241
You've been down to that second tier again, transitioning to maybe biannual evaluations at that point.

1242
02:14:55,631 --> 02:15:00,911
And then really just as a keep track of everything determining what the right timing will be to open the actual resource center.

1243
02:15:00,911 --> 02:15:08,161
And then finally, once they reach that threshold, creating the plan to develop and then opening the resource center next.

1244
02:15:12,421 --> 02:15:18,751
So thinking about some of the weaknesses for our recommendation, again, with the grounds, it could be a slower process.

1245
02:15:19,331 --> 02:15:22,561
You know, it's going to take multiple years and cycles to get this off the ground.

1246
02:15:22,921 --> 02:15:28,141
But we're hoping to just have that be kind of a hold over until they're able to figure out the for profit resource center.

1247
02:15:29,761 --> 02:15:32,550
With the for profit center. I think a lot of people brought up.

1248
02:15:32,551 --> 02:15:36,511
Some of the weaknesses we're going to discuss is that there could be trouble implementing this,

1249
02:15:36,511 --> 02:15:40,561
thinking about, you know, if they're able to recruit enough families who are willing or able to pay.

1250
02:15:41,581 --> 02:15:48,451
And then also the piece of sort of the sliding scale like how do you kind of determine what the cost should be for staff?

1251
02:15:49,321 --> 02:15:54,720
Will there be families that have been that are able to pay but have been receiving free care at the community care center,

1252
02:15:54,721 --> 02:15:59,401
and then you transition them over to the for profit center because, you know, they can pay or how do you kind of handle that?

1253
02:16:00,901 --> 02:16:05,911
And then again, it might be viewed negatively by the community and donors because it may be seen as off mission.

1254
02:16:06,481 --> 02:16:12,901
But I think we were of the understanding that, you know, you're still providing services for people in need and that falls on a mission for us.

1255
02:16:14,431 --> 02:16:19,591
And then the strategic plan, you know, their stop as is they don't have as much expertise in this area.

1256
02:16:20,071 --> 02:16:26,131
You know, this is a new venture for them. They don't have a lot of kind of structures to work off of from other organizations in this realm.

1257
02:16:28,951 --> 02:16:36,300
All right. So in addition to our main recommendation, we also considered some alternative ones,

1258
02:16:36,301 --> 02:16:39,661
which I'm going to try to run through fairly quickly, just running out of time.

1259
02:16:39,661 --> 02:16:47,071
But the first one, we suggest stage and establish a partnership or collaboration with the U.S. based nonprofit with a similar mission or values,

1260
02:16:47,371 --> 02:16:54,451
which can help increase public's public awareness of transmission outside of Lusaka and can also help encourage fundraising.

1261
02:16:54,901 --> 02:16:59,281
We also recommend that to explore relationships with investors in addition to donors.

1262
02:17:00,061 --> 02:17:03,121
This has yet to be explored a little bit further, but overall,

1263
02:17:03,121 --> 02:17:10,140
we found that this can help demonstrate the positive impact investors have on nonprofit organizations or fostering long term trust,

1264
02:17:10,141 --> 02:17:11,941
transparency and other potential funds.

1265
02:17:12,901 --> 02:17:19,411
And finally, we suggest that trying to establish a rapport with public Zambian figures to market and foster representation,

1266
02:17:19,681 --> 02:17:22,681
which can also decrease bias and perceptions of racism,

1267
02:17:23,101 --> 02:17:30,181
and this can be achieved by creating a board with greater Zambian presence, as opposed to solely having employees of Zambian representation.

1268
02:17:31,051 --> 02:17:37,111
This can also foster community engagement to recognize the value of the Lusaka community and their contributions,

1269
02:17:37,381 --> 02:17:42,931
which can possibly be achieved through information sessions or collecting feedback from the program participants.

1270
02:17:44,191 --> 02:17:47,821
And we can go to the next slide.

1271
02:17:49,381 --> 02:17:54,871
So those the though these recommendations may be effective, it's crucial that we assess the weaknesses as well.

1272
02:17:55,201 --> 02:17:59,280
So with the partnership collaboration option, we recognize it might be unfeasible.

1273
02:17:59,281 --> 02:18:04,560
So there might be guidelines US has to follow up before they can partner with other organizations,

1274
02:18:04,561 --> 02:18:10,081
especially if they're considering U.S. based organizations and that can be time consuming and may not even be effective.

1275
02:18:10,891 --> 02:18:12,661
What the investor relationship strategy?

1276
02:18:12,661 --> 02:18:18,361
Again, there might be policies or guidelines a nonprofit organization must adhere to in order to explore this option,

1277
02:18:18,361 --> 02:18:22,141
especially being an international nonprofit organization.

1278
02:18:22,411 --> 02:18:26,701
So they might have other protocols in place for something like this and additional

1279
02:18:26,701 --> 02:18:29,931
weaknesses that investors might not see the value in investing in each,

1280
02:18:30,001 --> 02:18:31,831
and especially while under financial constraint.

1281
02:18:32,131 --> 02:18:36,811
So there might not be a return on investment and that might hinder them from wanting to invest in the first place.

1282
02:18:36,811 --> 02:18:40,741
So perhaps feelings of accomplishment or emotional reward might not be enough for them.

1283
02:18:41,371 --> 02:18:44,781
And then the final strategy of marketing foster representation.

1284
02:18:44,791 --> 02:18:48,811
It might be difficult to find a public figure that would be willing to market and discuss the program.

1285
02:18:49,621 --> 02:18:52,771
And it may be difficult to find qualified members to participate on the board.

1286
02:18:53,521 --> 02:18:59,340
So now we go on to that discussion portion of the presentation so we can kind of just start with the first one.

1287
02:18:59,341 --> 02:19:02,611
So does SAHM fall under the White Savior complex trope?

1288
02:19:02,941 --> 02:19:09,511
And a follow up. What did they do or not do all to work effectively respectively within the community or respectfully within the community?

1289
02:19:10,051 --> 02:19:16,651
Yeah, because I think we've had a lot of discussions in the last few weeks about, you know, U.S. organizations going in and trying to provide aid to,

1290
02:19:16,681 --> 02:19:24,351
you know, communities internationally and, you know, either not doing it effectively or doing it a way that was even harmful as opposed to helpful.

1291
02:19:24,361 --> 02:19:30,751
So this was something that I really wanted to ask about today, and I think that part of the tour is fundraising kind of loops into this as well.

1292
02:19:31,081 --> 02:19:39,731
So what are people's thoughts? I told him and said specifically, let's face it, in this city of the founders.

1293
02:19:40,031 --> 02:19:45,871
But they mentioned like just a quick line about it. I didn't want to hire people from the U.S.

1294
02:19:46,151 --> 02:19:49,461
We had the country Zambia.

1295
02:19:49,481 --> 02:19:56,561
With that in mind that I wanted to have people that the people that are receiving those services are part of the organization.

1296
02:19:57,631 --> 02:20:02,761
You know. I found it interesting,

1297
02:20:02,771 --> 02:20:08,750
some of the language that was used when they were talking about like making sure that they're having people from Zambia working there.

1298
02:20:08,751 --> 02:20:15,461
And it seemed somewhat more the way it was phrased seems somewhat performative and that it's like,

1299
02:20:15,461 --> 02:20:18,851
okay, we need this so that we can get more people and gain trust.

1300
02:20:19,361 --> 02:20:24,161
But it didn't sound to me like they were saying,

1301
02:20:24,401 --> 02:20:28,541
we want to do this because it's the best way to actually engage with the community and

1302
02:20:28,541 --> 02:20:34,301
be a sustained and effective organization that is not just placing ourselves there.

1303
02:20:34,781 --> 02:20:39,491
So it felt a little weird, just like how they were talking about trying to do that.

1304
02:20:40,271 --> 02:20:41,441
Yeah, I think I noticed that, Drew.

1305
02:20:41,441 --> 02:20:46,031
I'm trying to remember the phrase, but I think it was saying, like avoiding perceptions of racism or something like that.

1306
02:20:46,031 --> 02:20:50,651
Which. Yes. Yeah. I think generally in order to.

1307
02:20:51,651 --> 02:21:02,181
Avoid the Western Savior complex rather than just white savior complexes, like if the people who were founding this organization up and left.

1308
02:21:03,331 --> 02:21:11,851
Would the organization survive with just people from whatever country running the organization that is sustainable,

1309
02:21:12,361 --> 02:21:16,801
that is really, truly showing that like they went there with the intention to.

1310
02:21:17,991 --> 02:21:22,161
To build something that is good for the country and the communities that are ahead.

1311
02:21:22,371 --> 02:21:28,731
And I only get that here, especially because it seems like even with all of the things that we discussed,

1312
02:21:29,151 --> 02:21:32,961
everything relied on them to get things done.

1313
02:21:33,171 --> 02:21:43,761
I guess grant writing reports on fundraising back in the USA for voluntourism like that that so many are like if

1314
02:21:43,761 --> 02:21:50,661
it was truly not going to fall under this trope that they wouldn't even consider tourism aspect of my image.

1315
02:21:51,411 --> 02:21:56,271
The reason I posed the question I did about the tourist component is because what strikes

1316
02:21:56,271 --> 02:22:03,921
me in the case is whether or not they are considering it as a way to find new donors.

1317
02:22:04,501 --> 02:22:11,060
You know, I have people coming through now. Are they inspired and they want to make a gift to the organization.

1318
02:22:11,061 --> 02:22:15,681
So then I have you know, I'm then I'm asking myself, all right, what are the merits of that?

1319
02:22:16,161 --> 02:22:20,390
You know, is that creating an effect where the community now,

1320
02:22:20,391 --> 02:22:24,201
where we are serving and delivering programs, starts to feel like they're being observed?

1321
02:22:24,621 --> 02:22:29,990
You know, how participatory is it? How inclusive is that? These are all kinds of questions, but at the end of the day,

1322
02:22:29,991 --> 02:22:35,511
we're all kind of helped us to see as the focus of this case is what are they supposed to do vis a vis their revenue?

1323
02:22:36,021 --> 02:22:41,961
So, you know, there's a there's a trade, you know, for every strategy, what do I get versus, you know, what?

1324
02:22:41,961 --> 02:22:49,581
What is the consequence for? Christiana to address both of those this question in that.

1325
02:22:50,181 --> 02:22:56,711
But first this question. I think the traditional healing workshops for me were like a little bit too far.

1326
02:22:56,721 --> 02:23:01,371
Like they have medical clinic training already and like information about like.

1327
02:23:04,151 --> 02:23:10,811
That's true. Medical information about like how to address their needs and stuff like that.

1328
02:23:10,951 --> 02:23:18,551
So I think like that's fine. But then to go in our workshop with like traditional healers is kind of like discrediting their culture.

1329
02:23:18,641 --> 02:23:23,621
I don't know. To me, I think they would if they wanted that information, they'd have it from the clinical clinic.

1330
02:23:23,621 --> 02:23:28,991
So that to me was like very upsetting. But then to address what you were saying about like the tourists,

1331
02:23:29,321 --> 02:23:40,391
I think with especially as like a Christian organization on top of being like foreign, I think it can be.

1332
02:23:42,531 --> 02:23:46,911
It's hard to maintain dignity of the people that you want to serve.

1333
02:23:47,211 --> 02:23:50,781
So I think it depends on what the people who are tourists are coming to do.

1334
02:23:51,031 --> 02:23:56,181
Like if the founders are planning to have them conduct services with the kids.

1335
02:23:56,391 --> 02:24:00,231
I think that's not fair and that's too much because it's not like a free for all.

1336
02:24:00,231 --> 02:24:04,911
You get to practice on people like they're real people. So that's why I don't like this.

1337
02:24:05,421 --> 02:24:10,251
I think you always just have to prioritize dignity and sustainability over money.

1338
02:24:10,461 --> 02:24:19,170
So I was like, I don't like that. It sounded like they were they were sort of anticipating that this voluntourism,

1339
02:24:19,171 --> 02:24:25,561
they will lose a lot of time and energy and funds doing administrative work.

1340
02:24:25,571 --> 02:24:31,351
So if you don't feel confident that you're going to attract donors, it's a no brainer.

1341
02:24:34,381 --> 02:24:41,821
It's common, especially among religious organizations, nonprofit organizations, to have someone to do something called the mission.

1342
02:24:41,841 --> 02:24:45,081
You know, it's a mission to a certain part of the world.

1343
02:24:45,861 --> 02:24:48,681
But I think Christiana makes an important point, which is, you know what?

1344
02:24:49,311 --> 02:24:57,981
What is the impact on the community there and what is the what what message is the organization sending and what are they looking to achieve?

1345
02:24:58,331 --> 02:25:05,431
And if it's breaking the core values of the organization simply to try and attract a donor, to get them to be involved.

1346
02:25:05,451 --> 02:25:10,461
You know, what's the what's the consequence that I'm now experiencing?

1347
02:25:14,971 --> 02:25:20,151
We'll will take one more. Over time, we're saying we can.

1348
02:25:20,151 --> 02:25:23,771
We've got a quick update and give you one guess as to what they chose.

1349
02:25:24,421 --> 02:25:28,121
It's on the back side of it. Oh, sorry. I'm sorry.

1350
02:25:32,941 --> 02:25:37,981
Okay. Oh. So we just wanted to very briefly close our presentation.

1351
02:25:37,991 --> 02:25:43,230
So in September of last year and had and 44 programs and they completed a strategy alignment

1352
02:25:43,231 --> 02:25:47,911
exercise just to kind of evaluate each program with cost effectiveness and the mission.

1353
02:25:48,121 --> 02:25:54,510
And they ended up closing two of their four. And so now they only have their community care center and their community outreach program.

1354
02:25:54,511 --> 02:26:01,921
So it's all they're still trying to find ways to manage and cut their costs and kind of figure out ways navigate the changes.

1355
02:26:01,951 --> 02:26:07,471
But their website did have they are now offering mission trips to socialism.

1356
02:26:07,681 --> 02:26:12,061
Yeah. Classic. Yeah, I just.

1357
02:26:15,821 --> 02:26:20,201
But what I want to emphasize is a couple of points here before we wrap and move on.

1358
02:26:20,831 --> 02:26:21,611
Number one,

1359
02:26:21,611 --> 02:26:29,661
I want you to start to give thought to intersectionality that we're starting to see between the different concepts where these things overlap.

1360
02:26:29,681 --> 02:26:34,121
They're not in a vacuum. Marketing is not on its own. The car is not on its own.

1361
02:26:34,661 --> 02:26:36,311
Philanthropy is not on its own.

1362
02:26:36,341 --> 02:26:42,721
I hope you're starting to see, especially through our cases, how these things start to become intertwined with one another.

1363
02:26:42,941 --> 02:26:45,970
How I relate to the board ties, to how I'm going to raise money,

1364
02:26:45,971 --> 02:26:50,721
ties that I'm going to make my communication strategy as to how I'm going to make stopping decisions.

1365
02:26:50,741 --> 02:26:58,541
These are this is the picture that I hope that you will start to see as we as we head toward the conclusion of our course of the next month or so,

1366
02:26:58,751 --> 02:27:09,371
hopefully. But the idea here is that we are looking at these concepts to integrate in an integrated fashion, not as just siloed departments.

1367
02:27:10,001 --> 02:27:16,601
The other point that I would like to add is I appreciate everyone bringing all of these different topics

1368
02:27:16,601 --> 02:27:22,531
and different sort of lenses for us to be able to view the different subjects that we're looking at.

1369
02:27:22,541 --> 02:27:29,171
So I encourage everyone, for those who are left to present, continue to bring us topics that help us to think through these issues.

1370
02:27:29,981 --> 02:27:33,011
The current events have been great to help us think through current topics,

1371
02:27:33,701 --> 02:27:38,561
as well as how we can focus on organizations and their role in addressing these.

1372
02:27:38,601 --> 02:27:44,711
So I just want to thank everyone for continuing the energy in keeping us moving as we head

1373
02:27:44,711 --> 02:27:49,601
through and to our excellent case report today for your wonderful synthesis of the case.

1374
02:27:49,961 --> 02:27:58,180
And as always, as I like to say every week, please read the case, and it makes for a much more thorough discussion.

1375
02:27:58,181 --> 02:28:03,161
But I appreciate everyone engaging with this dialog. And as always, it's always a privilege to learn.

1376
02:28:03,851 --> 02:28:07,541
We'll see you next week. It will be Election Day.

1377
02:28:07,541 --> 02:28:17,411
So I recognize that folks may have different paths that you may be involved in or if you are planning to vote on Election Day.

1378
02:28:17,921 --> 02:28:28,271
No know. But I will hope that because for me as to do anything the 2020 elections or.
