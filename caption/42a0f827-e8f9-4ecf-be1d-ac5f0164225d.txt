00:00:05,335 --> 00:00:10,354
In today's session of HMP 600, the health services system,

2
00:00:10,354 --> 00:00:16,755
we will be talking about education as a fundamental social determinant of health.

3
00:00:16,755 --> 00:00:22,139
We will review the social determinants of health, what that means.

4
00:00:22,139 --> 00:00:28,238
We will review the relationship between SES and health, and specifically

5
00:00:28,238 --> 00:00:34,551
will be evaluating the relationship between education and health in the US.

6
00:00:34,551 --> 00:00:38,962
And we will explain the idea of fundamental causes and

7
00:00:38,962 --> 00:00:44,951
consider how education is a fundamental social determinant of health.

8
00:00:47,460 --> 00:00:52,425
Just a reminder, social determinants of health are defined by

9
00:00:52,425 --> 00:00:58,329
the World Health Organization as the conditions in which people are born,

10
00:00:58,329 --> 00:01:00,790
grow, live, work, and age.

11
00:01:00,790 --> 00:01:04,560
And you'll note that these conditions are shaped by

12
00:01:04,560 --> 00:01:08,587
the distribution of resources like money, power, and

13
00:01:08,587 --> 00:01:14,040
other kinds of resources at the global national and local levels.

14
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:19,164
So what social determinants of health are the social and

15
00:01:19,164 --> 00:01:24,181
systemic factors and conditions that cause health and

16
00:01:24,181 --> 00:01:26,820
alternatively, disease.

17
00:01:26,820 --> 00:01:31,814
And it's important to keep in mind that when we talk about these

18
00:01:31,814 --> 00:01:36,999
social factors, we will include factors that promote health and

19
00:01:36,999 --> 00:01:42,580
factors that reduce the risk of illness, injury, disease or death.

20
00:01:42,580 --> 00:01:45,782
As well as factors that can harm health or

21
00:01:45,782 --> 00:01:50,501
increase the risk of illness, injury, disease or death.

22
00:01:53,380 --> 00:02:00,484
This graphic image shows a broad view of the social determinants of health,

23
00:02:00,484 --> 00:02:06,367
including what we in public health call the upstream factors,

24
00:02:06,367 --> 00:02:09,808
the social determinants of health.

25
00:02:09,808 --> 00:02:16,554
As well as the downstream factors that contribute to specific diseases,

26
00:02:16,554 --> 00:02:22,225
health outcomes like mortality or overall life expectancy.

27
00:02:22,225 --> 00:02:27,967
And when we're talking about social determinants of health,

28
00:02:27,967 --> 00:02:32,953
we are generally talking about factors that influence

29
00:02:32,953 --> 00:02:37,420
even individual behaviors and risk behaviors.

30
00:02:37,420 --> 00:02:45,507
So factors in the living environment in which we live work, grow etc.

31
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:55,166
When we're talking about socioeconomic status,

32
00:02:55,166 --> 00:03:00,904
this social scientists mean one of three different measures that

33
00:03:00,904 --> 00:03:06,350
are related to the distribution of key resources in society.

34
00:03:06,350 --> 00:03:12,630
These factors are income, education and occupation.

35
00:03:12,630 --> 00:03:15,546
And each of these separately and

36
00:03:15,546 --> 00:03:20,730
together determine access to key resources in society,

37
00:03:20,730 --> 00:03:25,266
to privilege to, power to control and autonomy,

38
00:03:25,266 --> 00:03:30,571
as well as other resources that are crucial to well being.

39
00:03:31,880 --> 00:03:37,110
These three SES factors are interrelated to one another.

40
00:03:37,110 --> 00:03:42,325
The income you have as a child will influence the education

41
00:03:42,325 --> 00:03:47,541
that you receive and ultimately the occupation you have,

42
00:03:47,541 --> 00:03:52,332
which influences your income, an ability to provide

43
00:03:52,332 --> 00:03:56,720
education to your own children or in the future.

44
00:03:56,720 --> 00:04:02,230
And so these factors are certainly interrelated with one another and

45
00:04:02,230 --> 00:04:07,550
so social scientists will sometimes explore the three together or

46
00:04:07,550 --> 00:04:12,220
any one of these at a time when talking about SES.

47
00:04:12,220 --> 00:04:17,696
SES is also related to other important social factors and conditions,

48
00:04:17,696 --> 00:04:22,806
many of which are also social determinants of health on their own,

49
00:04:22,806 --> 00:04:28,098
but it's important to keep in mind that SES is not the same as wealth,

50
00:04:28,098 --> 00:04:30,080
or race and ethnicity.

51
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:35,629
So we can talk about race and ethnicity as a social determinant of health,

52
00:04:35,629 --> 00:04:40,104
we can talk about wealth as a social determinant of health,

53
00:04:40,104 --> 00:04:44,070
or their role in the social determinants of health.

54
00:04:44,070 --> 00:04:49,961
And we can also talk about SES as different from these other factors.

55
00:04:52,310 --> 00:04:59,621
Bruce Link and Joe Phelan identified the idea of fundamental causes of health or

56
00:04:59,621 --> 00:05:03,890
fundamental social determinants of health.

57
00:05:03,890 --> 00:05:10,621
And they argued that SES is a fundamental social determinant of health.

58
00:05:10,621 --> 00:05:17,550
Fundamental social determinants of health have three characteristics.

59
00:05:17,550 --> 00:05:21,404
So Link and Phelan argued that SES creates or

60
00:05:21,404 --> 00:05:26,197
contributes to the creation of differential access to

61
00:05:26,197 --> 00:05:31,430
important social resources that affect the risk of risks.

62
00:05:31,430 --> 00:05:37,795
So the risk of illness, disease, injury, death,

63
00:05:37,795 --> 00:05:43,583
and SES creates access to resources that affect

64
00:05:43,583 --> 00:05:49,241
your risk of experiencing any of those risks.

65
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:55,572
Second characteristic of a fundamental social determinants

66
00:05:55,572 --> 00:06:00,218
of health is that the relationship between that social

67
00:06:00,218 --> 00:06:05,066
determinant of health, that social characteristic and

68
00:06:05,066 --> 00:06:09,415
health exists and persists across time and space.

69
00:06:09,415 --> 00:06:14,142
And the relationship between SES and health exists and

70
00:06:14,142 --> 00:06:17,951
persists across time and across the world.

71
00:06:19,210 --> 00:06:24,046
And finally, the third characteristic of a fundamental social

72
00:06:24,046 --> 00:06:29,239
determinant of health and a characteristic of SES is that SES factors

73
00:06:29,239 --> 00:06:34,190
are not themselves ideologically specific for any given cause.

74
00:06:34,190 --> 00:06:38,909
They don't specifically cause the disease

75
00:06:38,909 --> 00:06:43,390
that creates ill health or causes death.

76
00:06:43,390 --> 00:06:49,130
Instead, socioeconomic status factors buffer or

77
00:06:49,130 --> 00:06:53,135
exacerbate risk in multiple ways,

78
00:06:53,135 --> 00:06:59,409
creating cumulative effects, cumulative advantages

79
00:06:59,409 --> 00:07:04,356
in the case of SES buffers that reduce risk.

80
00:07:04,356 --> 00:07:09,879
And SES can also create cumulative disadvantages

81
00:07:09,879 --> 00:07:16,201
that exacerbate risk for illness, disease, or death.

82
00:07:18,460 --> 00:07:23,356
So let's take a look at the relationship between SES and health,

83
00:07:23,356 --> 00:07:26,211
specifically focused on education.

84
00:07:26,211 --> 00:07:31,130
One of those three factors defining social economic status and

85
00:07:31,130 --> 00:07:36,991
we'll look at education as a fundamental social determinants of health.

86
00:07:38,810 --> 00:07:44,044
So for example, mortality rates in the United States

87
00:07:44,044 --> 00:07:48,250
are strongly associated with education.

88
00:07:48,250 --> 00:07:53,721
So this graph shows age adjusted mortality rates

89
00:07:53,721 --> 00:08:01,728
per 1000 persons overall 24.2 deaths per 1000 persons and

90
00:08:01,728 --> 00:08:07,090
then that rate by different education levels.

91
00:08:07,090 --> 00:08:13,097
So the mortality rate is almost 62 per 1000 persons for

92
00:08:13,097 --> 00:08:17,690
those with less than a high school education,

93
00:08:17,690 --> 00:08:23,020
about 31 per 1000 for those with some college.

94
00:08:23,020 --> 00:08:28,417
And compared to only about 13 per 1000 deaths for

95
00:08:28,417 --> 00:08:31,370
those with a college degree.

96
00:08:31,370 --> 00:08:36,083
And this is measured over a long period of time in a study

97
00:08:36,083 --> 00:08:39,471
over this period in the United States.

98
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:45,299
Another way to think about and

99
00:08:45,299 --> 00:08:50,840
recognize the relationship between education and

100
00:08:50,840 --> 00:08:56,247
health is in this graph which shows that the risk or

101
00:08:56,247 --> 00:09:01,815
odds of dying decline with each year of education.

102
00:09:01,815 --> 00:09:06,664
But that there is also a threshold difference

103
00:09:06,664 --> 00:09:11,530
with having a high school degree versus not.

104
00:09:11,530 --> 00:09:16,055
And so what this means is there's a significant difference in

105
00:09:16,055 --> 00:09:20,492
the risk of death between having even 12 years of school but

106
00:09:20,492 --> 00:09:24,690
not a degree compared to those with a high school degree.

107
00:09:24,690 --> 00:09:30,136
This is also referred to as a discontinuity

108
00:09:30,136 --> 00:09:38,630
in the relationship between years of education and risk of death.

109
00:09:38,630 --> 00:09:43,958
You'll also note that this graph shows that even after the high

110
00:09:43,958 --> 00:09:50,190
school degree that each year of education, the risk, sorry about that,

111
00:09:50,190 --> 00:09:55,941
the risk of death continues to decline with each year of education.

112
00:09:58,200 --> 00:10:03,981
Another way to look at this is to see that education levels are associated

113
00:10:03,981 --> 00:10:08,840
with specific diseases, in this case diabetes for adults.

114
00:10:08,840 --> 00:10:13,841
So here we can see that those with less than a high school education,

115
00:10:13,841 --> 00:10:18,583
higher percentage of those adults have diagnosis of diabetes,

116
00:10:18,583 --> 00:10:21,918
compared to those with a high school degree,

117
00:10:21,918 --> 00:10:26,161
compared to those with more than high school education.

118
00:10:29,980 --> 00:10:35,700
Education also matters even for self reported physical health problems.

119
00:10:35,700 --> 00:10:40,280
And the extent to which those interfere with daily activities.

120
00:10:40,280 --> 00:10:45,246
A higher percentage of adults with less than a high school education say they

121
00:10:45,246 --> 00:10:50,758
experience physical health problems that interfere with their daily activities,

122
00:10:50,758 --> 00:10:55,646
compared to high school graduates, compared to those with some college,

123
00:10:55,646 --> 00:10:57,850
compared to college graduates.

124
00:10:57,850 --> 00:11:04,110
So education is related to all of these different

125
00:11:04,110 --> 00:11:10,217
aspects of health as defined by the fundamental

126
00:11:10,217 --> 00:11:15,735
causes of social determinants of health.

127
00:11:15,735 --> 00:11:24,170
And so all of the examples we just looked at showed that SES is related to health.

128
00:11:24,170 --> 00:11:29,601
And we can think about the ways that SES creates that differential

129
00:11:29,601 --> 00:11:34,934
access to resources that affect the risk of those health risks or

130
00:11:34,934 --> 00:11:37,940
disease risks we just looked at.

131
00:11:37,940 --> 00:11:43,988
And so some of the things we wanna think about are the ways that SES,

132
00:11:43,988 --> 00:11:48,848
and in this case education, is related to these other

133
00:11:48,848 --> 00:11:53,924
kinds of resources that help one protect against risk,

134
00:11:53,924 --> 00:11:56,948
enable the avoidance of risk, or

135
00:11:56,948 --> 00:12:03,001
enable seeking effective treatment if that risk is unavoidable.

136
00:12:03,001 --> 00:12:09,324
If one has a genetic cause of disease for example, an unavoidable risk,

137
00:12:09,324 --> 00:12:15,353
do they have the resources to seek effective treatment in that case?

138
00:12:15,353 --> 00:12:20,561
For other cases we can think about, for other examples we can think

139
00:12:20,561 --> 00:12:25,676
how education might enable one to protect oneself against risk or

140
00:12:25,676 --> 00:12:29,410
to enable one to avoid risk to begin with.

141
00:12:29,410 --> 00:12:35,830
Some of those factors we could think about are for example health literacy.

142
00:12:35,830 --> 00:12:42,482
The ability to understand recommendations from health care providers,

143
00:12:42,482 --> 00:12:48,169
to understand the relationship between healthy behaviors and

144
00:12:48,169 --> 00:12:52,261
health outcomes, and these are related to.

145
00:12:52,261 --> 00:12:56,706
We can see that health literacy is related

146
00:12:56,706 --> 00:13:01,290
to education levels in the United States.

147
00:13:01,290 --> 00:13:05,947
And so to the extent that health literacy helps enable

148
00:13:05,947 --> 00:13:11,350
the avoidance of risks, helps enable effective treatment.

149
00:13:11,350 --> 00:13:14,268
If that risk is unavoidable,

150
00:13:14,268 --> 00:13:19,988
those with less education are less able to avoid the risk or

151
00:13:19,988 --> 00:13:24,901
seek effective treatment if they face that risk.

152
00:13:27,220 --> 00:13:31,426
This is another study that shows

153
00:13:31,426 --> 00:13:36,881
the relationships between education and

154
00:13:36,881 --> 00:13:42,489
health and shows to some extent the ability

155
00:13:42,489 --> 00:13:46,880
to protect against those risks.

156
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:49,597
So this is a complicated graph.

157
00:13:49,597 --> 00:13:55,463
On the right side of each graph is the level of educational attainment,

158
00:13:55,463 --> 00:14:02,131
less than high school, high school degree, some college, or college degree.

159
00:14:04,380 --> 00:14:11,883
And what is measured on this axis is active life expectancy at age 50,

160
00:14:11,883 --> 00:14:16,510
which means the amount of healthy years that

161
00:14:16,510 --> 00:14:22,010
one could expect to live at the age of 50.

162
00:14:22,010 --> 00:14:26,190
You'll note that this is for men, both grafts are for men.

163
00:14:26,190 --> 00:14:32,170
And the difference between the top graph and the lower graph is,

164
00:14:32,170 --> 00:14:37,042
the the top graph is men who reported having good, or

165
00:14:37,042 --> 00:14:42,581
very good childhood health compared to those who had fair or

166
00:14:42,581 --> 00:14:44,940
poor childhood health.

167
00:14:44,940 --> 00:14:49,284
So their individual health was either fair or

168
00:14:49,284 --> 00:14:54,040
poor or good or better than good as a child.

169
00:14:54,040 --> 00:14:58,938
Now, the final characteristic of this graph is

170
00:14:58,938 --> 00:15:04,206
this axis here, which is childhood socioeconomic

171
00:15:04,206 --> 00:15:09,237
adversities including the parents education.

172
00:15:09,237 --> 00:15:15,956
And whether they grew up in a household in which the mother and

173
00:15:15,956 --> 00:15:21,490
or father had less than eight years of education,

174
00:15:21,490 --> 00:15:26,100
as well as whether the family was poor, or

175
00:15:26,100 --> 00:15:30,187
had experienced significant move or

176
00:15:30,187 --> 00:15:38,210
even the child lived outside of the home for some period of time.

177
00:15:38,210 --> 00:15:42,860
So as you can see that for each education level,

178
00:15:42,860 --> 00:15:50,320
there is some relationship with more childhood socioeconomic adversity.

179
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:55,209
There is lower active life expectancy levels

180
00:15:55,209 --> 00:16:00,872
compared to those who have no childhood adversity,

181
00:16:00,872 --> 00:16:09,280
even among men who had poor health, fair or poor health themselves.

182
00:16:09,280 --> 00:16:11,760
And this is true in this graph as well.

183
00:16:11,760 --> 00:16:16,946
But what you'll also see is that their own educational

184
00:16:16,946 --> 00:16:21,682
attainment is also associated with having less or

185
00:16:21,682 --> 00:16:25,639
more active life expectancy at age 50.

186
00:16:25,639 --> 00:16:32,175
And so in some ways this graph is showing these multiple intersections

187
00:16:32,175 --> 00:16:38,062
between childhood education and socioeconomic conditions.

188
00:16:38,062 --> 00:16:43,748
As well as the individual's own educational attainment and

189
00:16:43,748 --> 00:16:49,211
the differences across groups in those levels indicating

190
00:16:49,211 --> 00:16:55,241
how education is a fundamental social determinants of health.

191
00:16:56,800 --> 00:17:03,122
And this second indicator reminds us the relationship between SES and

192
00:17:03,122 --> 00:17:07,750
health exists and persists across time and space.

193
00:17:07,750 --> 00:17:11,864
So there's a direct positive relationship,

194
00:17:11,864 --> 00:17:16,294
higher SES, higher income, higher education,

195
00:17:16,294 --> 00:17:22,840
higher occupational status is associated with better health outcomes.

196
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:28,771
This relationship exists in all countries where it's been measured, whether

197
00:17:28,771 --> 00:17:33,530
they're industrialized or not, whether they have universal health care or not.

198
00:17:33,530 --> 00:17:38,759
This relationship persists, and it persists across time

199
00:17:38,759 --> 00:17:44,970
as well as across changes in disease and treatment and risk factors.

200
00:17:44,970 --> 00:17:51,101
So the fact that it's persisted across the 20th century despite cures for

201
00:17:51,101 --> 00:17:55,988
disease, incredible new treatments for major diseases and

202
00:17:55,988 --> 00:18:02,830
changes in exposure to disease, we still see this relationship persist.

203
00:18:02,830 --> 00:18:10,161
There's also some evidence that this relationship between SES factors and

204
00:18:10,161 --> 00:18:14,990
health is linear rather than a threshold effect.

205
00:18:14,990 --> 00:18:20,772
The threshold effect is like what we saw in that very first graph for

206
00:18:20,772 --> 00:18:25,522
a high school degree, that there's a big jump between

207
00:18:25,522 --> 00:18:30,170
the relationship between health and odds of death for

208
00:18:30,170 --> 00:18:36,910
those less than a high school degree and those more than a high school degree.

209
00:18:36,910 --> 00:18:41,701
But we also saw that decline continue even after

210
00:18:41,701 --> 00:18:45,781
the degree with each year of education.

211
00:18:49,050 --> 00:18:52,834
So the relationship between SES and

212
00:18:52,834 --> 00:18:57,630
health is about both absolute deprivation,

213
00:18:57,630 --> 00:19:03,951
a very low resources being associated with poorer health.

214
00:19:03,951 --> 00:19:09,807
But it's also relative status, each year of education

215
00:19:09,807 --> 00:19:15,416
is associated with an additional benefit to health,

216
00:19:15,416 --> 00:19:19,300
a lower risk of death, for example.

217
00:19:19,300 --> 00:19:23,651
So it's both absolute resources and relative status.

218
00:19:24,700 --> 00:19:30,470
It's also important to remember that there is a recursive

219
00:19:30,470 --> 00:19:35,301
relationship between socioeconomic status and

220
00:19:35,301 --> 00:19:39,436
health that will look at in just a minute.

221
00:19:39,436 --> 00:19:43,634
Which means, SES causes health outcomes is

222
00:19:43,634 --> 00:19:48,854
associated strongly with those health outcomes, and

223
00:19:48,854 --> 00:19:53,980
health is associated with socioeconomic outcomes.

224
00:19:53,980 --> 00:20:01,150
So the relationship between SES and health goes in both directions.

225
00:20:01,150 --> 00:20:05,721
That's what reverse or recursive causality means.

226
00:20:08,030 --> 00:20:13,997
This graph shows us the gap in life expectancy

227
00:20:13,997 --> 00:20:18,552
at age 30 between the highest and

228
00:20:18,552 --> 00:20:23,109
lowest levels of education within

229
00:20:23,109 --> 00:20:28,630
countries in the industrialized world.

230
00:20:28,630 --> 00:20:37,150
And the comparison is also between shows a gap between men and women.

231
00:20:37,150 --> 00:20:41,542
So for example, in the United States, for

232
00:20:41,542 --> 00:20:48,862
women there is a four year gap between those with the lowest education,

233
00:20:48,862 --> 00:20:54,853
to those with the highest education at age 30 for women.

234
00:20:54,853 --> 00:21:00,112
For men in the United States, the gap is about seven

235
00:21:00,112 --> 00:21:05,864
years between those with the lowest education level and

236
00:21:05,864 --> 00:21:10,161
those with the highest education level.

237
00:21:12,590 --> 00:21:18,003
You can see that some countries have lower gaps,

238
00:21:18,003 --> 00:21:23,419
Turkey, Sweden, Canada the UK, for example,

239
00:21:23,419 --> 00:21:27,908
all have somewhat lower gaps not only for

240
00:21:27,908 --> 00:21:32,021
women on education but also for men.

241
00:21:34,290 --> 00:21:41,653
So this is demonstrating that the relationship between education and

242
00:21:41,653 --> 00:21:46,768
health in this case, life expectancy at age 30

243
00:21:46,768 --> 00:21:51,901
exists across countries throughout the world.

244
00:21:53,680 --> 00:21:58,638
This image, this graphic shows some of this recursive

245
00:21:58,638 --> 00:22:02,860
relationship between education and health.

246
00:22:02,860 --> 00:22:06,203
So education creates opportunities for

247
00:22:06,203 --> 00:22:10,840
better health through multiple intervening factors.

248
00:22:10,840 --> 00:22:17,469
And health of course also has effects on education,

249
00:22:17,469 --> 00:22:23,043
so poor health can result in lower education

250
00:22:23,043 --> 00:22:27,713
through these kinds of factors, and

251
00:22:27,713 --> 00:22:35,111
both are embedded in larger social economic conditions.

252
00:22:35,111 --> 00:22:40,298
Those broad social determinants of health such as the individual or

253
00:22:40,298 --> 00:22:44,484
family characteristics that the individual is born or

254
00:22:44,484 --> 00:22:48,579
grows up in, that affect both education and health.

255
00:22:56,590 --> 00:23:01,954
Finally, we can talk about the third characteristic

256
00:23:01,954 --> 00:23:07,201
which is that socioeconomic factors like education

257
00:23:07,201 --> 00:23:13,279
are not themselves directly the cause of any given disease or

258
00:23:13,279 --> 00:23:17,560
the reported cause of death for example.

259
00:23:17,560 --> 00:23:22,149
But instead, it's the role that socioeconomic status

260
00:23:22,149 --> 00:23:28,006
characteristics play in either buffering risk or exacerbating risk,

261
00:23:28,006 --> 00:23:33,510
creating those cumulative advantages and disadvantages.

262
00:23:33,510 --> 00:23:38,307
So, it's individual level resources which might be

263
00:23:38,307 --> 00:23:43,744
individual level, health literacy plus the environmental

264
00:23:43,744 --> 00:23:47,911
conditions in which one lives for education.

265
00:23:47,911 --> 00:23:51,151
That would be the school environment,

266
00:23:51,151 --> 00:23:54,980
whether there are enough resources to learn,

267
00:23:54,980 --> 00:24:00,576
whether there are enough books to be distributed in the classroom,

268
00:24:00,576 --> 00:24:06,881
whether there are effective resources and teaching resources available.

269
00:24:07,930 --> 00:24:13,459
It would have to do with behavioral effects of both the individual,

270
00:24:13,459 --> 00:24:20,560
but also in the broader environment, in the broader social environment.

271
00:24:20,560 --> 00:24:25,246
It also has to do with the health care that can be accessed and

272
00:24:25,246 --> 00:24:31,000
understood, and this broader culture social network, social norms.

273
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:35,320
All of these are creating cumulative advantages or

274
00:24:35,320 --> 00:24:40,560
disadvantages related to socioeconomic characteristics.

275
00:24:40,560 --> 00:24:46,208
And so as just an example, again related to education,

276
00:24:46,208 --> 00:24:51,134
we can think about the role of healthcare, and so

277
00:24:51,134 --> 00:24:54,619
even with the same access to care,

278
00:24:54,619 --> 00:25:00,060
adults with more education, report better health.

279
00:25:00,060 --> 00:25:05,314
And so this is for adults across the the full age range that

280
00:25:05,314 --> 00:25:10,790
are showing self reported excellent or very good health for

281
00:25:10,790 --> 00:25:16,080
patients of Kaiser Permanente in Northern California.

282
00:25:16,080 --> 00:25:23,133
So these are all people who have access to Kaiser Permanente,

283
00:25:23,133 --> 00:25:27,472
and yet we see real differences in self

284
00:25:27,472 --> 00:25:32,501
reported health across education groups.

285
00:25:34,670 --> 00:25:39,374
We can even see it within the health plan and

286
00:25:39,374 --> 00:25:42,790
within a particular disease.

287
00:25:42,790 --> 00:25:48,519
So here we can also see that the diabetes, the death rate for

288
00:25:48,519 --> 00:25:53,562
patients with diabetes varies by education level,

289
00:25:53,562 --> 00:26:00,640
even for those with the same health plan and the same access to care.

290
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:06,280
And you can see that the rates also vary between males and

291
00:26:06,280 --> 00:26:11,560
females, but that those with a college education or

292
00:26:11,560 --> 00:26:16,960
some college have lower death rates from diabetes for

293
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:24,770
patients with diabetes at Kaiser Permanente in Northern California.

294
00:26:24,770 --> 00:26:29,707
So health care is necessary, but it is certainly not sufficient to

295
00:26:29,707 --> 00:26:35,230
overcome socioeconomic status factors relationship to health.

296
00:26:35,230 --> 00:26:41,807
So of course, we need to pay attention to health insurance coverage,

297
00:26:41,807 --> 00:26:45,708
quality of care and health disparities,

298
00:26:45,708 --> 00:26:50,740
which is the role of healthcare for health outcomes.

299
00:26:50,740 --> 00:26:55,743
But health care alone and policies to deal with health

300
00:26:55,743 --> 00:27:03,550
care alone are not sufficient to address the relationship between SES and health.

301
00:27:03,550 --> 00:27:08,532
So we need policies and resources outside of health care to

302
00:27:08,532 --> 00:27:13,006
address the factors that cause people with low SES to

303
00:27:13,006 --> 00:27:17,390
experience greater illness, disease and death.

304
00:27:17,390 --> 00:27:23,631
Policies such as universal access to early childhood education programs,

305
00:27:23,631 --> 00:27:28,702
increased funding for primary and secondary education, and

306
00:27:28,702 --> 00:27:35,650
community investments in healthy food access and accessible healthy green space.

307
00:27:35,650 --> 00:27:40,763
So, we have read multiple articles that talk

308
00:27:40,763 --> 00:27:45,607
about various social policies that affect

309
00:27:45,607 --> 00:27:50,470
health outside of the role of health care.

310
00:27:50,470 --> 00:27:56,330
And this is because these factors are upstream factors all

311
00:27:56,330 --> 00:28:02,916
related to health outcomes like life expectancy and mortality.

312
00:28:02,916 --> 00:28:09,328
And even the downstream factors related to health behaviors and

313
00:28:09,328 --> 00:28:14,911
health care access through educational attainment and

314
00:28:14,911 --> 00:28:18,961
even early exposures in the household.

315
00:28:20,020 --> 00:28:26,852
So, just a final look at SES as a fundamental social determinant of health,

316
00:28:26,852 --> 00:28:31,660
because it creates differential access to important

317
00:28:31,660 --> 00:28:35,741
resources that affect one's risk of risks.

318
00:28:37,270 --> 00:28:42,088
This relationship between SES and health exists and

319
00:28:42,088 --> 00:28:45,482
persists across time and space, and

320
00:28:45,482 --> 00:28:51,740
SES factors are not themselves the ideological causes of disease.

321
00:28:51,740 --> 00:28:56,488
But instead it is how socioeconomic status buffers or

322
00:28:56,488 --> 00:28:59,759
exacerbates risk in multiple ways,

323
00:28:59,759 --> 00:29:05,140
creating cumulative advantages for some who have high SES,

324
00:29:05,140 --> 00:29:09,904
or cumulative disadvantages for those with low SES.
