1
00:00:13,162 --> 00:00:20,182
All right, good morning, everyone. Getting colder must mean the semester is moving along.

2
00:00:20,182 --> 00:00:31,792
So this lecture, I've purposefully arranged for it to be a little bit on the short side just because traditionally this Tuesday,

3
00:00:31,792 --> 00:00:38,572
prior to the proposal being due, is usually a time where people have questions to ask.

4
00:00:38,572 --> 00:00:43,222
So I want it to free up some time for questions about that.

5
00:00:43,222 --> 00:00:46,162
We can start with it.

6
00:00:46,162 --> 00:00:53,002
And I'm also expecting we'll have a little bit of time at the end of the lecture, but to come back to just kind of open questions.

7
00:00:53,002 --> 00:01:01,802
So with that, please consider an invitation. Do folks have any questions on the proposal at this stage?

8
00:01:01,802 --> 00:01:07,882
Don't the system just it's like having a hard time writing it, but what are you looking for?

9
00:01:07,882 --> 00:01:16,522
The answer is part is just like with a proposal like uncertainty that by the way, what exactly are you looking for?

10
00:01:16,522 --> 00:01:22,792
For it. Yeah. And and actually today we've covered it, but today's lecture actually comes back to it a little bit.

11
00:01:22,792 --> 00:01:27,232
So hopefully that'll be a little bit of a refresher that we talked about.

12
00:01:27,232 --> 00:01:37,882
A couple of areas where uncertainty can come into play and part of it is related to our measurements themselves.

13
00:01:37,882 --> 00:01:47,032
Right. The ability of of a measurement or an assessment to accurately capture what exposure might be.

14
00:01:47,032 --> 00:01:53,572
Right. So we talked about like a personal monitor that I might wear that should be recording

15
00:01:53,572 --> 00:01:58,492
a pretty accurate making an accurate assessment of what my own exposure is.

16
00:01:58,492 --> 00:02:08,932
If we have an area monitor somewhere else in the room, it's still a relevant and justifiable way to assess my exposure.

17
00:02:08,932 --> 00:02:13,642
But there might be a greater amount of uncertainty associated with that estimate.

18
00:02:13,642 --> 00:02:22,022
There's also other there's there's natural variability that comes into play as well that can impact uncertainty.

19
00:02:22,022 --> 00:02:29,332
And like I said, conveniently, we actually have at least a slide coming up in the lecture or we'll revisit it.

20
00:02:29,332 --> 00:02:36,592
But that's what I'm that's what I'm hoping you'll be able to address, is going through the context of what you're proposing,

21
00:02:36,592 --> 00:02:46,252
kind of think through where would be the areas where, you know, there might be uncertainty involved and you could even address that.

22
00:02:46,252 --> 00:02:50,152
As you know, when you're comparing pros and cons, you could say,

23
00:02:50,152 --> 00:02:56,122
I'm choosing this method or I'm proposing this method because there would be while there's still some uncertainty,

24
00:02:56,122 --> 00:03:02,172
it will be less compared to some of the others that might be considered.

25
00:03:02,172 --> 00:03:03,972
Sure.

26
00:03:03,972 --> 00:03:18,392
Yeah, so I guess I was just curious, what were the strategies for, for example, wanted to be like, should we be like five centimeters with our heads?

27
00:03:18,392 --> 00:03:28,032
Yeah, I mean, to the extent that you think it's important to highlight maybe the value or something of it,

28
00:03:28,032 --> 00:03:34,122
uh, let's see what what what kind of crazy example could I come up with?

29
00:03:34,122 --> 00:03:41,562
I don't know. Instead of like I tend to use this classroom as an example context and we just talked about area measurements.

30
00:03:41,562 --> 00:03:45,852
If I said, well, I would propose Marium measurements in the classroom.

31
00:03:45,852 --> 00:03:50,982
If you think that that area of measurement is more valuable to assess my exposure,

32
00:03:50,982 --> 00:03:58,602
if the instructor by putting it kind of right here in front of a podium versus towards the back of the room,

33
00:03:58,602 --> 00:04:06,102
you know, that might be a detail that you want to actually, you know, go ahead and go ahead and explain.

34
00:04:06,102 --> 00:04:15,792
But if they're somewhat random in nature now, you know, you don't need to to propose or to, you know, to talk to and a great amount of detail,

35
00:04:15,792 --> 00:04:22,332
like like your example, about five centimeters in the showerhead or whatever that would be necessary.

36
00:04:22,332 --> 00:04:32,592
Yeah, these are great questions. Yeah. Rebecca, I think you talked about this, and I kind of want to provide so much like knowledge.

37
00:04:32,592 --> 00:04:40,482
Are we assuming on the part of the computer, like how much in depth to go about what this is and what that means?

38
00:04:40,482 --> 00:04:42,972
Yeah, yeah, yeah. That's a really good question.

39
00:04:42,972 --> 00:04:59,952
So you can assume that the the reviewers, I guess, write of your proposal definitely have like scientific and public health background.

40
00:04:59,952 --> 00:05:04,962
They're perhaps not like the experts in exposure assessment,

41
00:05:04,962 --> 00:05:11,442
and that's why they're seeking out your ideas for how to improve and how to do things better.

42
00:05:11,442 --> 00:05:20,322
So, you know, you don't need to spoon feed it to like a complete lay audience or something like that.

43
00:05:20,322 --> 00:05:28,452
You can assume that the people reviewing it will have, you know, an appropriate amount of scientific background in the area in the topic.

44
00:05:28,452 --> 00:05:35,802
But they might not appreciate they know that exposure assessment is the thing, but they don't really know what are the best ways to do it.

45
00:05:35,802 --> 00:05:40,702
And so that's where you're coming in is it's kind of laying out these are the options.

46
00:05:40,702 --> 00:05:55,102
This is what I think would be best and kind of why. Great questions.

47
00:05:55,102 --> 00:06:02,212
And by the way, your your questions are actually really informative to me, not just the ones in class,

48
00:06:02,212 --> 00:06:06,622
you know, people have emailed me asking for clarification and the assignment.

49
00:06:06,622 --> 00:06:09,652
Well, when you say this, do you mean this or that?

50
00:06:09,652 --> 00:06:16,372
So it's actually helping me because I see where I can better clarify that assignment language itself.

51
00:06:16,372 --> 00:06:21,052
So your input and your questions is actually benefiting next year's class

52
00:06:21,052 --> 00:06:26,032
because the assignment will be better clarified in the way that it's written.

53
00:06:26,032 --> 00:06:42,432
So thanks for that. Any other questions coming to mind?

54
00:06:42,432 --> 00:06:49,362
OK, like I said, well, if you think of any during the class period, we'll come back around to it again at the end and then the logistics,

55
00:06:49,362 --> 00:06:55,602
you know, hopefully are pretty straightforward for submitting the assignment.

56
00:06:55,602 --> 00:07:00,642
I did have a question, got an email from a student yesterday who was confused.

57
00:07:00,642 --> 00:07:03,372
I don't know what Candice does, some strange things.

58
00:07:03,372 --> 00:07:10,632
I created the assignment and then somehow Canvas sent out a notification about like a change in the due date.

59
00:07:10,632 --> 00:07:14,022
And she said, wait a second, is it did you change the due date? You know?

60
00:07:14,022 --> 00:07:17,372
And I said, no. And it actually it's weird. It's a change, but it's not.

61
00:07:17,372 --> 00:07:20,202
It just is announcing it for the most part.

62
00:07:20,202 --> 00:07:33,712
I can't control what canvas does, but it's still Thursday before eight thirty and it's just submitting a file through the campus site.

63
00:07:33,712 --> 00:07:40,732
Given your preference for piaffe or whatever is easiest, I think in general,

64
00:07:40,732 --> 00:07:49,882
Deedes tends to translate better, you know, between operating systems and uploads and downloads.

65
00:07:49,882 --> 00:07:58,282
But at the same time, I'm not looking for anything to be pretty, you know, so like graphics wise or whatever, so I'm not as concerned about it.

66
00:07:58,282 --> 00:08:00,412
I also understand that whatever PDF is like,

67
00:08:00,412 --> 00:08:05,542
maybe this unnecessary stuff for people that aren't comfortable with that stuff and you don't want to send me a word,

68
00:08:05,542 --> 00:08:11,362
doc, or some sort of word processing file, that's that's totally fine.

69
00:08:11,362 --> 00:08:14,812
I will let you know if, you know, when I go to read it.

70
00:08:14,812 --> 00:08:20,482
And it's all garbled and messy, like, OK, you know, Josh, I can't read your file.

71
00:08:20,482 --> 00:08:24,832
Let's figure this out. But I'm not expecting any trouble with that.

72
00:08:24,832 --> 00:08:29,992
So whatever whatever your preference, you know. All right. That is me. One question.

73
00:08:29,992 --> 00:08:35,302
Can we include figures that we like take from other papers if we say appropriately?

74
00:08:35,302 --> 00:08:42,642
Absolutely. Absolutely. Yeah, hopefully there's not like a recently published Journal article that says,

75
00:08:42,642 --> 00:08:48,732
like the pros and cons of various exposure assessment methods for people in Michigan,

76
00:08:48,732 --> 00:08:53,592
and you're just kind of like cutting and pasting it and fighting it. But, yes, absolutely.

77
00:08:53,592 --> 00:09:09,722
You can use. You don't need to recreate the real rate of that perfect graphic or table already exist.

78
00:09:09,722 --> 00:09:16,622
What about shifting gears quickly, but sticking on Q&A, what about the breakout discussions from the last period,

79
00:09:16,622 --> 00:09:33,522
class period around the debates working within your debate teams, were there any questions that came up either during that or are subsequent to that?

80
00:09:33,522 --> 00:09:38,382
OK, cool. Again, we got plenty of time on that one.

81
00:09:38,382 --> 00:09:46,752
Hopefully you actually pushed it out of your mind, at least for the next couple of days until this proposal is behind.

82
00:09:46,752 --> 00:09:51,102
All right. Well, like I said, we'll come back around to some questions today.

83
00:09:51,102 --> 00:09:59,202
We'll continue talking about aspects of exposure assessment, but specifically within the context of risk assessment.

84
00:09:59,202 --> 00:10:12,072
And what actually does that mean and why is that an important aspect of what we consider when doing exposure assessment?

85
00:10:12,072 --> 00:10:20,562
So our learning objectives here at a basic level is to define what the goals are when it comes to risk assessment.

86
00:10:20,562 --> 00:10:27,052
We're going to step through in a fair amount of detail the four components of risk assessment.

87
00:10:27,052 --> 00:10:36,732
So in this order, hazard identification, exposure assessment itself, how does that fit into the risk assessment paradigm dose response?

88
00:10:36,732 --> 00:10:41,892
And then finally risk characterization? And like I just said,

89
00:10:41,892 --> 00:10:48,282
understanding the role of the exposure assessment and risk assessment and then finishing

90
00:10:48,282 --> 00:10:54,462
up with understanding the relationship between risk assessment and risk management.

91
00:10:54,462 --> 00:11:00,132
And a lot of these terms are kind of seem interchangeable, but they're not they're distinctly different.

92
00:11:00,132 --> 00:11:08,672
And that'll be a big aspect of today's lecture is to clarify those.

93
00:11:08,672 --> 00:11:16,952
So starting with some people, starting with some kind of definitions, again,

94
00:11:16,952 --> 00:11:24,212
terms that may seem the same, but better or not, when we talk about risk, just risk itself.

95
00:11:24,212 --> 00:11:34,682
We're talking about the probability of injury, disease or death from exposure to to some sort of hazard.

96
00:11:34,682 --> 00:11:40,262
And in this case, risk is a function of the exposure potential,

97
00:11:40,262 --> 00:11:54,602
the receptor characteristics and the likelihood of occurrence of exposures and health effects, whereas risk assessment is an approach or a process.

98
00:11:54,602 --> 00:12:02,162
So it's the scientific approach for how we evaluate the potential for harm from environmental hazards.

99
00:12:02,162 --> 00:12:10,892
So this is kind of how we distinguish the two. So for risk assessment, we're specifically asking questions like how harmful is it?

100
00:12:10,892 --> 00:12:19,892
How important of a priority is it? Or should it be identifying which of the agents are of the greatest concern?

101
00:12:19,892 --> 00:12:24,662
Again, kind of back to priority. What's their comparative risk?

102
00:12:24,662 --> 00:12:28,952
Right. One versus another type of hazard.

103
00:12:28,952 --> 00:12:41,192
And then this whole concept of risk assessment as a term or as a scientific approach was really formally codified by the National

104
00:12:41,192 --> 00:12:49,922
Academies in 1983 when they published a document titled Risk Assessment in the Federal Government Managing the Process.

105
00:12:49,922 --> 00:12:53,612
And from that day forward, people refer to it as the Red Book.

106
00:12:53,612 --> 00:12:59,672
And as you might imagine, based on let's call it.

107
00:12:59,672 --> 00:13:08,852
So within the U.S., we have this four part framework for assessing risk, and these are the four components.

108
00:13:08,852 --> 00:13:13,382
Again, we're going to walk through them all, but it starts with hazard identification,

109
00:13:13,382 --> 00:13:21,062
moves through exposure assessment and dose response and finishes with risk characterization.

110
00:13:21,062 --> 00:13:27,442
And we'll step through each of these in a little bit of detail.

111
00:13:27,442 --> 00:13:33,832
First off, who regulates risk and again, we're talking specifically about the U.S. here,

112
00:13:33,832 --> 00:13:43,642
there's four primary agencies that are charged with truly regulating risk once the EPA that we've talked about quite a bit in this class.

113
00:13:43,642 --> 00:13:53,752
Another is the FDA on the workplace side, huge involvement from Occupational Safety and Health Administration,

114
00:13:53,752 --> 00:13:59,182
OSHA, as well as the Consumer Product Safety Commission.

115
00:13:59,182 --> 00:14:04,552
There are other agencies, even though they're not directly involved in regulation itself,

116
00:14:04,552 --> 00:14:09,712
but that are involved or contribute to the risk assessment process.

117
00:14:09,712 --> 00:14:16,372
These can include state and local level environmental and health agencies,

118
00:14:16,372 --> 00:14:24,382
any number of nongovernmental organizations at the federal level, Health and Human Services,

119
00:14:24,382 --> 00:14:27,652
that includes all of the National Institutes of Health,

120
00:14:27,652 --> 00:14:38,682
as well as the Department of the Interior would be agencies that we would also consider part of the risk assessment here in the U.S.

121
00:14:38,682 --> 00:14:46,962
And a silly graphic here to kind of illustrate a basic point risk assessment is not simple.

122
00:14:46,962 --> 00:14:57,822
The reality itself can be so complex that equally valid observations from differing perspectives can appear to be contradictory.

123
00:14:57,822 --> 00:15:07,812
Right. So on this side here, I'll step through it. This is a little bit of a brain teaser where this person is looking at the bars,

124
00:15:07,812 --> 00:15:14,922
laying on the ground and sees one, two, three, four, five, six, seven of them.

125
00:15:14,922 --> 00:15:23,262
Whereas the person over here on the other side is looking at those same bars and sees one, two, three, four, five of them.

126
00:15:23,262 --> 00:15:32,892
They are both convinced. Right. Of reality in their observations.

127
00:15:32,892 --> 00:15:39,972
And then, I mean, as as humans, we're actually pretty good at assessing risks historically,

128
00:15:39,972 --> 00:15:46,042
so, you know, big forest fire run in the other direction, right?

129
00:15:46,042 --> 00:15:50,442
Same thing this volcanoes erupting. We probably don't want to go towards that.

130
00:15:50,442 --> 00:15:58,242
We want to get away from it as far as possible. We talked about this back and we're looking at biological hazards.

131
00:15:58,242 --> 00:16:03,612
But these insects, this definitely is the case for me. I see a spider or a snake.

132
00:16:03,612 --> 00:16:14,352
I am going to be as far away as possible from them. But moving to, you know, modern risks, we're not quite as good.

133
00:16:14,352 --> 00:16:22,002
And there are some challenges in our own kind of innate ability to to assess risks and to illustrate that.

134
00:16:22,002 --> 00:16:27,762
And again, you guys, you're a little bit more informed than the average folks, you know across campus.

135
00:16:27,762 --> 00:16:32,932
But let's go through this exercise. You can you can do this on your own.

136
00:16:32,932 --> 00:16:37,242
You don't need to pair off or whatever. We'll discuss it here in a minute.

137
00:16:37,242 --> 00:16:47,352
But out of these seven choices, go ahead and take a minute, think through them each and come up with a ranked order in terms of decreasing risk.

138
00:16:47,352 --> 00:16:59,292
So no one would be the one that is the greatest risk of chance of death all the way down to number seven,

139
00:16:59,292 --> 00:17:04,932
which would be the least amount of risk of death.

140
00:17:04,932 --> 00:18:35,282
I'll go ahead and give you maybe maybe two minutes, just kind of consider these and come up with your your own ranked order.

141
00:18:35,282 --> 00:18:44,432
All right, what do folks think, what would be the highest risk of death from which of these activities?

142
00:18:44,432 --> 00:18:51,332
And he thought that his family is eating a thousand bananas.

143
00:18:51,332 --> 00:18:54,872
I don't know if they're really getting like radiation or balloons all at once.

144
00:18:54,872 --> 00:19:03,152
And very little. I feel like he's living someplace out of all these, probably like the chance to get in a traffic accident or something.

145
00:19:03,152 --> 00:19:13,312
OK, so just let me 12 months in Denver and you would.

146
00:19:13,312 --> 00:19:17,842
The degree is which one may be the most dangerous. OK.

147
00:19:17,842 --> 00:19:28,372
All right, so we got we got three going living in Denver, eating a thousand bananas, traveling by four hours by canoe.

148
00:19:28,372 --> 00:19:36,862
Any others? All right, so then with that, I'm assuming the folks think that it's one of those three,

149
00:19:36,862 --> 00:19:41,562
so by show of hands who thinks it's eating a thousand bananas,

150
00:19:41,562 --> 00:19:49,992
several people who think this traveling for hours by canoe, a more people who thinks living 12 months in Denver.

151
00:19:49,992 --> 00:19:58,332
Josh All right. OK, let's see how we did. And thank you if you didn't skip ahead in the slide deck.

152
00:19:58,332 --> 00:20:05,922
Yeah. So Andrea and several others, you raise your hand. No one is traveling for hours by canoe.

153
00:20:05,922 --> 00:20:09,582
And actually, let's let's put it in start with number seven.

154
00:20:09,582 --> 00:20:19,432
I kind of step through them. So. Right. A lot of people think that, like living within a nuclear plant is would would be perhaps the highest.

155
00:20:19,432 --> 00:20:30,192
And in fact, it's not it's quite low risk of death by living one year within 20 miles of a nuclear plant.

156
00:20:30,192 --> 00:20:39,792
Next on that list is traveling 600 miles by train to actually six and seven are both very, very, very low risk compared to all of the others.

157
00:20:39,792 --> 00:20:46,992
Number five is flying 100 miles in this, you know, assumes in an airplane at altitude.

158
00:20:46,992 --> 00:20:51,642
And the concern here is the exposure to cosmic radiation.

159
00:20:51,642 --> 00:21:02,112
Number four is eating those thousand bananas and the concern there is for exposure to radioactive potassium.

160
00:21:02,112 --> 00:21:09,702
That's that's in the bananas. Number three is eating 80 tablespoons of peanut butter.

161
00:21:09,702 --> 00:21:19,482
And this kind of goes back again when we're looking at biological hazards that aflatoxin in the moldy peanuts is the explanation of the risk there.

162
00:21:19,482 --> 00:21:26,892
And then number two, so it's significant because living 12 months in Denver and Denver,

163
00:21:26,892 --> 00:21:31,272
specifically beyond living in an urban area and all the other risk that might come associated

164
00:21:31,272 --> 00:21:38,472
with it is looking at the altitude of the city and the amount of cosmic radiation exposure.

165
00:21:38,472 --> 00:21:46,362
And then, of course, no one or that the highest chance of death or risk of death is just traveling for hours by.

166
00:21:46,362 --> 00:21:53,022
And in this case, the concern is just simply an accident that occurs over the course of those four hours.

167
00:21:53,022 --> 00:21:59,652
Cool. Thank you so much for your engagement on that. Any any questions about the how to order the bananas?

168
00:21:59,652 --> 00:22:07,482
I would kill you to ask him exactly like the Taliban. They had a lot of potassium and that would suck or even not be radioactive.

169
00:22:07,482 --> 00:22:14,482
Yeah, yeah. And it's and it's a good point, right. Because, like, it clarifies the duration here and some of these words and others it doesn't.

170
00:22:14,482 --> 00:22:19,062
The canoe is like it's four hours. Denverites living for for 12 months.

171
00:22:19,062 --> 00:22:22,662
You can get some contacts with some contacts would be helpful.

172
00:22:22,662 --> 00:22:29,842
Excellent point. There is that thousand in one day, right.

173
00:22:29,842 --> 00:22:34,132
What however you slice that is going to come up with some other considerations. Absolutely.

174
00:22:34,132 --> 00:22:38,082
Fair point. Could I see another hand up, go up and ask the same question.

175
00:22:38,082 --> 00:22:44,892
OK, ok. Yeah. I guess for the Denver where they are solely looking about radiation and nothing else,

176
00:22:44,892 --> 00:22:57,102
I think not, not looking at nothing else, but that is the biggest driver, you know.

177
00:22:57,102 --> 00:23:09,642
Any other comments or questions? All right, so anyway, that the point of this exercise, this ranking exercise, is that, yeah, you know,

178
00:23:09,642 --> 00:23:19,242
as kind of innate ability to recognize risk as people when it comes to fires and volcanoes and things like this.

179
00:23:19,242 --> 00:23:30,912
Right. We kind of know better. We can assess what that risk is pretty, pretty accurately and with technology and development,

180
00:23:30,912 --> 00:23:38,262
things that are becoming more chatter, more challenging to us in the modern era.

181
00:23:38,262 --> 00:23:47,112
All right. So let's go ahead and step through these different components to risk assessment, starting with hazard identification.

182
00:23:47,112 --> 00:23:55,872
And with this, we're asking questions like what health problems are caused by the pollutant?

183
00:23:55,872 --> 00:24:09,122
So hazard it and ID were interested in being able to describe what are the potential adverse health effects from each type of specific agent?

184
00:24:09,122 --> 00:24:21,192
What are the mechanisms by which those specific agents cause adverse impacts on how we're looking at the dose, the root of exposure,

185
00:24:21,192 --> 00:24:28,092
the duration and the timing of exposure it's associated with with adverse effects and hazard

186
00:24:28,092 --> 00:24:38,502
identification is more of a descriptive process and not so much of a quantitative process.

187
00:24:38,502 --> 00:24:46,752
There's within hazard identification, there's there's basically four steps within identification,

188
00:24:46,752 --> 00:24:53,022
one is reviewing data on toxicology and human health impacts.

189
00:24:53,022 --> 00:24:59,442
Number two is identifying, describing the mode of action within the body.

190
00:24:59,442 --> 00:25:05,682
Number three is reviewing the fate and exposure under which health effects might arise.

191
00:25:05,682 --> 00:25:15,772
And then number four is conducting a weight of evidence evaluation in the hazard application process.

192
00:25:15,772 --> 00:25:20,602
So going through each of those steps, what actually does that look like?

193
00:25:20,602 --> 00:25:30,232
So in step one where we're reviewing the data, we're looking for descriptive evidence, for specific potential impacts.

194
00:25:30,232 --> 00:25:35,452
These might be specific parts of the body that are associated with a specific exposure.

195
00:25:35,452 --> 00:25:39,982
Most importantly, in in reviewing data,

196
00:25:39,982 --> 00:25:52,672
there's a significant distinction between distinguishing between cancer responses and basically everything else are non cancer health impacts.

197
00:25:52,672 --> 00:26:04,252
We might consider again, the root is in an oral ingestion or as an inhalation exposure and then being able to describe data that

198
00:26:04,252 --> 00:26:15,652
will underpin our subsequent risk assessment to follow the first step to of hazard identification,

199
00:26:15,652 --> 00:26:26,852
where we want to describe the mode of action. And we consider information like how animal studies might relate to humans.

200
00:26:26,852 --> 00:26:35,252
So again, this is getting into the literature, how the response varies with dose, especially at low doses.

201
00:26:35,252 --> 00:26:43,792
So kind of filling out are beginning to address that dose response, as if that comes further in the process,

202
00:26:43,792 --> 00:26:49,672
how the impact varies across different populations or susceptible populations and importantly,

203
00:26:49,672 --> 00:26:56,782
over time, and then how and under what conditions an agent actually causes harm.

204
00:26:56,782 --> 00:27:01,282
And then just to clarify here, when we talk about mode of action,

205
00:27:01,282 --> 00:27:13,422
this is looking at cellular level and it's different in traditional toxicology when we talk about a mechanism of action at a molecular level.

206
00:27:13,422 --> 00:27:19,992
Moving on to step three of hazard identification, this is fate and exposure.

207
00:27:19,992 --> 00:27:30,162
So what media agent, most likely the agents most likely to accumulate in their movement through media, through the environment.

208
00:27:30,162 --> 00:27:39,372
How long are they in these environments? And then based on those, what would we be looking for as the relevant routes of exposure?

209
00:27:39,372 --> 00:27:46,032
So we'd be considering indicators like, is the hazard persistent?

210
00:27:46,032 --> 00:27:51,342
Right. So does or doesn't degrade rapidly in the environment?

211
00:27:51,342 --> 00:28:00,562
Does it bioaccumulate in the food chain and it doesn't have a high toxicity or not?

212
00:28:00,562 --> 00:28:06,892
And then step for positive identification is looking to evaluate the weight of evidence.

213
00:28:06,892 --> 00:28:17,542
So what exactly does that mean? It's basically a narrative that summarizes hazard assessment and has conclusions

214
00:28:17,542 --> 00:28:23,332
regarding human cancer or non cancer potential for distinguishing clearly between them.

215
00:28:23,332 --> 00:28:29,242
Two. It explains the evidence available and kind of how it all fits together.

216
00:28:29,242 --> 00:28:33,802
So it's a synthesis of information that's been gathered.

217
00:28:33,802 --> 00:28:40,652
And ideally, we're able to point out significant issues, strength of the data,

218
00:28:40,652 --> 00:28:46,012
the limitations of the data and conclusions that can be made through this evaluation

219
00:28:46,012 --> 00:28:54,742
of weight of evidence here isn't the kind of it from the framework specific to

220
00:28:54,742 --> 00:29:02,302
carcinogenic potential that the International Agency for Research on Cancer or AYAK

221
00:29:02,302 --> 00:29:08,122
classify substances to show whether they're suspected to cause cancer or not.

222
00:29:08,122 --> 00:29:17,572
It places these substances into one of five categories, depending on the strength of evidence that's available for their carcinogenicity.

223
00:29:17,572 --> 00:29:24,742
Over here, if it's classified as being group one, this means there's absolutely carcinogenic to humans.

224
00:29:24,742 --> 00:29:34,552
And as part of the verification process, it would be shown that there's sufficient evidence in humans and a causal relationship established.

225
00:29:34,552 --> 00:29:41,212
If it's classified as group to A, it means that it's probably carcinogenic to humans.

226
00:29:41,212 --> 00:29:49,972
And evidence wise, it means that there's perhaps limited evidence in humans, but sufficient evidence in, say, animal models.

227
00:29:49,972 --> 00:29:55,862
If it's classified as to group to B, it's possibly carcinogenic to humans.

228
00:29:55,862 --> 00:30:01,102
We might have limited evidence in humans and then insufficient evidence in animals.

229
00:30:01,102 --> 00:30:09,592
Let me further down this list. Group three would be the carcinogenicity is not classifiable.

230
00:30:09,592 --> 00:30:15,832
So in that case, we would basically have inadequate evidence both in humans and in animal models.

231
00:30:15,832 --> 00:30:24,442
And then Group four is that it's probably not carcinogenic and this would be that there's evidence supporting this conclusion.

232
00:30:24,442 --> 00:30:33,522
The evidence suggests new carcinogenicity in humans or in animal models.

233
00:30:33,522 --> 00:30:41,772
All right, so moving ahead to the second component in risk assessment, and this is actually exposure assessment,

234
00:30:41,772 --> 00:30:45,672
so this one we've talked about quite a bit in this class up to this point.

235
00:30:45,672 --> 00:30:53,562
So we're asking questions like how much of a hazard or pollutant do people inhale during a specific time period?

236
00:30:53,562 --> 00:30:58,482
Right. In the case of airborne contaminants?

237
00:30:58,482 --> 00:31:03,732
How many people are exposed?

238
00:31:03,732 --> 00:31:15,462
And through exposure assessment, we're looking to identify and evaluate right to the human population that's exposed to a specific agent,

239
00:31:15,462 --> 00:31:25,572
we're looking at the composition and the size of the population. As you know, from several references over the course with exposure assessment.

240
00:31:25,572 --> 00:31:35,052
We're looking at quantifying the magnitude, the frequency, the duration, as well as the route of exposure.

241
00:31:35,052 --> 00:31:44,172
And then we're using exposure information to then estimate dose.

242
00:31:44,172 --> 00:31:50,532
Hopefully this doesn't give you any traumatic recalls of Professor Jolies,

243
00:31:50,532 --> 00:31:59,032
I know that he's pressing and demanding and looking at intake fractions, but this is where it comes into play.

244
00:31:59,032 --> 00:32:03,522
This is where it's highly relevant when we're estimating dose.

245
00:32:03,522 --> 00:32:12,222
Step one is assessing intake. So we're looking at this equation over here to the left, we have a massive agent entering the body.

246
00:32:12,222 --> 00:32:18,792
Our intake is a function of the concentration of the agent in the medium, the intake rate.

247
00:32:18,792 --> 00:32:27,492
So the rate at which the medium enters the body, the exposure duration and its bioavailability.

248
00:32:27,492 --> 00:32:33,882
Right. So if we go through a very simple example for a contaminant in air, in this case,

249
00:32:33,882 --> 00:32:40,002
PM 2.5 here's are transferring the formula, we can actually calculate this value.

250
00:32:40,002 --> 00:32:49,632
In this case, the concentration is to be simple. One simple math, one milligram per cubic meter of ppm 2.5 would actually be quite a bit.

251
00:32:49,632 --> 00:32:55,422
The intake rate would be someone breathing 20 cubic meters per day.

252
00:32:55,422 --> 00:33:01,872
The exposure duration would be one day in this example, the bioavailability one day.

253
00:33:01,872 --> 00:33:05,892
So we basically have one times, twenty times,

254
00:33:05,892 --> 00:33:19,072
one times one hour intake or massive agent entering the body in this example would be 20 milligrams of ppm, 2.5.

255
00:33:19,072 --> 00:33:36,262
Step two, we're looking at dose rate, so and we're distinguishing again between non cancer effects and carcinogens specifically for non carcinogens.

256
00:33:36,262 --> 00:33:47,812
We're using average Daily Dose where that average daily dose is the intake divided by body mass times, the average period,

257
00:33:47,812 --> 00:33:58,972
so that the course of days, the duration of days specifically for carcinogens and because of the nature of how those health effects come to fruition,

258
00:33:58,972 --> 00:34:02,782
we're looking at lifetime average daily dose,

259
00:34:02,782 --> 00:34:13,462
which is calculated by the lifetime intake divided by body mass and again times the lifetime in days or years.

260
00:34:13,462 --> 00:34:17,722
And then for these assumptions, a lifetime is usually considered about 70 years.

261
00:34:17,722 --> 00:34:26,542
Or if we're using days, this would be a bit over 25000 days.

262
00:34:26,542 --> 00:34:36,802
Moving on to dose response assessment as being the third component of risk assessment and in this case for dose response,

263
00:34:36,802 --> 00:34:42,432
we're asking what are the health problems at different exposure levels?

264
00:34:42,432 --> 00:34:48,022
So we're looking to better understand that dose response relationship.

265
00:34:48,022 --> 00:34:55,882
And this is a curve I think Professor Meeker showed a dose response curve that looked quite similar to this.

266
00:34:55,882 --> 00:35:03,442
Right. But again, we're looking at what is, you know, as our dose is increasing.

267
00:35:03,442 --> 00:35:06,352
How does the response change?

268
00:35:06,352 --> 00:35:24,472
And our ability to quantify that relationship between dose and response absolutely informs our ability to to predict and assess the risk.

269
00:35:24,472 --> 00:35:42,652
And then moving on to risk characterization. So at this point, we're asking, what's that extra risk of health problems in an exposed population?

270
00:35:42,652 --> 00:35:46,822
So mischaracterization really kind of brings everything all together,

271
00:35:46,822 --> 00:35:54,142
all of this information that we've been seeking out and trying to quantify and describe risk characterization evaluates the overall

272
00:35:54,142 --> 00:36:03,052
quality of the assessment and the confidence we have in those estimates of risk and what our ultimate conclusions would be.

273
00:36:03,052 --> 00:36:11,092
So it brings together the hazard identification, the exposure assessment and the dose response,

274
00:36:11,092 --> 00:36:21,382
and it describes the risks to individuals and populations in terms of the extent and severity of probable harm.

275
00:36:21,382 --> 00:36:31,612
It also has a very important component that communicates results to decision makers.

276
00:36:31,612 --> 00:36:39,292
And this is this is getting back to Samuel's question at the start of class around uncertainty, right?

277
00:36:39,292 --> 00:36:48,922
So there is variability that is absolutely part of this process of assessing exposures and assessing risk.

278
00:36:48,922 --> 00:36:59,062
And to kind of reiterate variability refers to quantities that are inherently variable or heterogeneous within a population.

279
00:36:59,062 --> 00:37:02,992
So these might be things like food consumption rates, right?

280
00:37:02,992 --> 00:37:06,412
Some people eat less. Some people eat more.

281
00:37:06,412 --> 00:37:16,372
This would certainly impact their intake of a contaminant that's in food right through an ingestion round the exposure duration.

282
00:37:16,372 --> 00:37:23,422
So over what time period, some people might be exposed less of a less amount of time compared to others.

283
00:37:23,422 --> 00:37:25,762
And then again, simply expected lifetime. Right.

284
00:37:25,762 --> 00:37:37,452
When we're looking at carcinogenic effects where people out of their life stage and how long they might be expected to lose.

285
00:37:37,452 --> 00:37:43,812
And then contrasting kind of that that that expected variability within a population,

286
00:37:43,812 --> 00:37:55,212
we have true uncertainty and we we characterize this or kind of define it as being the lack of precise knowledge

287
00:37:55,212 --> 00:38:02,562
of potential exposure scenarios or lack of knowledge of potential distribution of exposure variables.

288
00:38:02,562 --> 00:38:13,062
So how well measured are these exposures that the data that we're relying on and how well defined are the models?

289
00:38:13,062 --> 00:38:18,762
Right. We talk a lot about using models as part of the exposure assessment process.

290
00:38:18,762 --> 00:38:29,382
Our the accuracy of the assumptions that we make in the models, the quality of input data going into the models absolutely predict how well the model

291
00:38:29,382 --> 00:38:34,482
outputs are and then inherently how much uncertainty is associated with those exposure.

292
00:38:34,482 --> 00:38:39,822
Model outputs are numerous examples here on the table.

293
00:38:39,822 --> 00:38:49,452
This is pulled from the reading for today's lecture that basically goes through each of the components of risk assessment through exposure assessment,

294
00:38:49,452 --> 00:38:56,442
hazard identification, dose response and then risk characterization and talks about, you know,

295
00:38:56,442 --> 00:39:06,492
where there are sources of uncertainty within each of those components that contributes to an overall uncertainty.

296
00:39:06,492 --> 00:39:14,142
And then importantly, and I think I'm almost done with regard to risk assessment,

297
00:39:14,142 --> 00:39:18,492
risk management and risk communication, they're all actually interlinked.

298
00:39:18,492 --> 00:39:25,902
So importantly, this whole process of risk assessment, right where we're looking at hazard identification,

299
00:39:25,902 --> 00:39:33,192
dose response, relationships and exposure assessment, which leads us to this risk characterization.

300
00:39:33,192 --> 00:39:38,652
Right. Which includes an estimation of our our statement of uncertainty.

301
00:39:38,652 --> 00:39:44,532
Right. How much confidence do we have in that risk characterization or risk assessment?

302
00:39:44,532 --> 00:39:49,062
This directly informs risk communication. Right.

303
00:39:49,062 --> 00:40:02,382
So public opinion's different considerations of risk, but through a couple of it directly informs risk management.

304
00:40:02,382 --> 00:40:07,932
But through this risk communication, it's also kind of secondarily or indirectly informing.

305
00:40:07,932 --> 00:40:15,852
Right. So the risk assessment and the risk characterization directly goes to to risk managers.

306
00:40:15,852 --> 00:40:25,152
Right. Leading to regulatory decisions. How is policy derived based on the information but but indirectly.

307
00:40:25,152 --> 00:40:25,812
Right.

308
00:40:25,812 --> 00:40:37,322
Once that information gets out there through through how it's communicated and others are informed, that can also impact risk management as well.

309
00:40:37,322 --> 00:40:44,982
Right. I'm actually I'm going to turn it around. And without going into too much detail,

310
00:40:44,982 --> 00:40:55,872
I'm going to ask you to to think about covid-19 and maybe give some examples of of what's

311
00:40:55,872 --> 00:41:04,602
kind of played out or continues to play out in how risk is assessed or was assessed,

312
00:41:04,602 --> 00:41:11,842
how it's communicated and how it's resulted in in policy.

313
00:41:11,842 --> 00:41:28,352
What are some examples that folks can think of? I didn't give up massively in schools, for example,

314
00:41:28,352 --> 00:41:44,152
like I keep seeing in local newspapers up North Coast an article about a mosque and they like being revoked, they're more violent for no longer.

315
00:41:44,152 --> 00:41:49,742
John King. Absolutely. So that's an excellent example, right?

316
00:41:49,742 --> 00:41:55,222
So Mascha mandates, so there's been some some risk characterization.

317
00:41:55,222 --> 00:42:03,292
Right. And, you know, kind of the science from exposure scientist that's informed this process there.

318
00:42:03,292 --> 00:42:04,802
It's limited, right?

319
00:42:04,802 --> 00:42:13,822
There's some amount of uncertainty because there's not a whole lot of historical science to rely on because covid-19 is a novel virus.

320
00:42:13,822 --> 00:42:20,632
Right. So whatever information was on hand or continues to be on hand, I guess we're accumulating some now.

321
00:42:20,632 --> 00:42:24,982
But earlier on in the pandemic, it would just kind of be some other viruses.

322
00:42:24,982 --> 00:42:28,012
Right. And that was that the knowledge base that we had.

323
00:42:28,012 --> 00:42:41,452
And it was that, yes, wearing masks is going to lower the risk of contracting covid-19 and lower the risk of transmitting it to others.

324
00:42:41,452 --> 00:42:44,962
And so that was directly informing risk management. Right.

325
00:42:44,962 --> 00:42:54,052
Or regulatory decisions. There were actually, as Andrea mentioned, math mandates quite broadly and many areas of the country.

326
00:42:54,052 --> 00:42:58,492
But then also the communication of that risk publicly. Right.

327
00:42:58,492 --> 00:43:02,362
Has kind of like circled back and to the point that, you know,

328
00:43:02,362 --> 00:43:11,992
legislators are also playing roles in those policy and regulatory decisions, that it's kind of evolved over time.

329
00:43:11,992 --> 00:43:21,082
Right. And it's I guess it's a whole nother discussion about the sources of information that's forming the public opinions.

330
00:43:21,082 --> 00:43:31,402
But clearly. Right. How well that risk assessment or risk characterization was communicated has impacted what those public opinions are.

331
00:43:31,402 --> 00:43:37,192
Excellent example. Any anything else that comes to mind within this framework,

332
00:43:37,192 --> 00:43:43,242
which I guess that was often cited and I'm not really sure why the statistic is that a lot of people would say, as you know,

333
00:43:43,242 --> 00:43:49,792
has been a one percent chance of fatality, which I think was kind of used to a lot of people who would say that would generally

334
00:43:49,792 --> 00:43:55,162
be used as evidence of liability mask mandates or indeed or anything like that.

335
00:43:55,162 --> 00:43:58,642
And then it kind of goes to show how porous communication is.

336
00:43:58,642 --> 00:44:04,782
Really hard core. Yeah, face value, one percent of that doesn't sound very good, but that's kind of the outcome.

337
00:44:04,782 --> 00:44:11,032
Worried, but also like like if you like one hundred people up and he said like, hey,

338
00:44:11,032 --> 00:44:14,692
someone's going to disappear if you're in this line, like no one would stand in that line.

339
00:44:14,692 --> 00:44:21,292
And so as time goes to show how people's understanding of risk is very great, absolutely great.

340
00:44:21,292 --> 00:44:26,152
Great point. And, and great examples that yes.

341
00:44:26,152 --> 00:44:29,122
As a public or as a society. Right.

342
00:44:29,122 --> 00:44:41,842
As this pandemic and even to this day, but especially early on in the pandemic, there are risk mitigation strategies that we that we adopted.

343
00:44:41,842 --> 00:44:53,272
Don't give a second thought to that. Have a risk of death much, much, much lower than the risk of death posed by exposure to go in 19.

344
00:44:53,272 --> 00:45:00,322
And, yeah, it's it's kind of like and I'm trying to stay clear of politics,

345
00:45:00,322 --> 00:45:06,352
but the you know, the legislative agenda that's that's in front of Congress right now.

346
00:45:06,352 --> 00:45:10,132
And what do you pay attention to it? A lot or not.

347
00:45:10,132 --> 00:45:18,082
You've probably come away with Congress is trying to to pass bills that involve spending lots of money.

348
00:45:18,082 --> 00:45:22,342
Like for me, I don't care how many trillion, whatever that number is.

349
00:45:22,342 --> 00:45:25,612
Right. A trillion is a ton of money to me.

350
00:45:25,612 --> 00:45:33,862
And and fairly, people respond with, wow, that's a lot of money that they're spending, regardless of whether it's four trillion or one trillion.

351
00:45:33,862 --> 00:45:41,932
And, you know, to the general public, this is the response and conversely is with a very small number.

352
00:45:41,932 --> 00:45:48,262
Right. One percent is most people kind of interpret that as a is a very, very small number.

353
00:45:48,262 --> 00:45:49,972
So why is it you know,

354
00:45:49,972 --> 00:46:00,502
the question rhetorically is why would someone drastically change their behaviors if there's only a one percent chance of something happening?

355
00:46:00,502 --> 00:46:04,882
All right. Great job. I won't I won't believe it.

356
00:46:04,882 --> 00:46:09,452
Any questions on any of the material that we've covered?

357
00:46:09,452 --> 00:46:11,482
Actually, I've got one one last slide here.

358
00:46:11,482 --> 00:46:23,952
Any questions about risk assessment, how exposure assessment fits into it, risk characterization and so forth?

359
00:46:23,952 --> 00:46:33,612
This was a reminder just in we did actually discussed this earlier on in the semester, but in terms of future directions and risk assessment, right.

360
00:46:33,612 --> 00:46:38,712
We talked exclusively today about risk assessment within the U.S.,

361
00:46:38,712 --> 00:46:48,192
the regulatory agencies that are involved and the four components that are employed as part of the risk assessment process in Europe.

362
00:46:48,192 --> 00:46:51,372
This this looks significantly different, right?

363
00:46:51,372 --> 00:47:01,462
We talked about reach the registration, evaluation, authorization and restriction of chemicals that's in play that has been now for over a decade.

364
00:47:01,462 --> 00:47:10,002
And that requires all chemicals manufactured, imported and used in the European Union to be assessed for safety.

365
00:47:10,002 --> 00:47:19,842
It's a very different risk assessment framework that's currently and historically and currently being employed in the U.S. But it has been because

366
00:47:19,842 --> 00:47:32,832
it's requiring chemicals that are imported and used in the U.S. So that means those developed and and exported from the U.S. and other countries.

367
00:47:32,832 --> 00:47:40,002
This Rietz requirement in Europe is is having ramifications beyond just Europe.

368
00:47:40,002 --> 00:47:49,752
It's actually impacting the way companies approach risk assessment because of these requirements within Europe specifically.

369
00:47:49,752 --> 00:48:01,442
And and, you know, indirectly, hopefully this is having an impact worldwide as we as we slowly move forward.

370
00:48:01,442 --> 00:48:06,632
So I will go ahead and start with lecture materials there,

371
00:48:06,632 --> 00:48:26,292
but I have the promise I was going to come back around and see if folks had any other questions that came to mind regarding that proposal assignment.

372
00:48:26,292 --> 00:48:30,672
I was just curious what kind of clothes out this proposal,

373
00:48:30,672 --> 00:48:42,552
because it makes sense to you what you would like to choose based on the fact that the person has volunteered to give their blood samples.

374
00:48:42,552 --> 00:48:46,432
So how do we look and like that kind of thing?

375
00:48:46,432 --> 00:48:56,952
Yeah, yeah. That's a good it's a good question. I've had several people asking me what structure actually organized this right going forward.

376
00:48:56,952 --> 00:49:06,012
And my default is just go ahead and use the, um, the grading rubric.

377
00:49:06,012 --> 00:49:14,322
If you're unsure, step through with an introduction, go through the expert, which is really the meat of the proposal.

378
00:49:14,322 --> 00:49:18,162
Is is your exposure assessment methodology considerations. Right.

379
00:49:18,162 --> 00:49:29,832
Pros and cons. The advantages, disadvantages kind of refine that then with what you were proposing and what your justification is within that context,

380
00:49:29,832 --> 00:49:45,822
be sure to address uncertainties that might be associated with what you've proposed and then finish up by kind of delineating how any standards

381
00:49:45,822 --> 00:49:57,642
that are in place with regards to pithos in Michigan might affect how you how you interpret your results from your from your exposure assessment.

382
00:49:57,642 --> 00:50:01,542
And it's you can just stop there. You don't need to say so.

383
00:50:01,542 --> 00:50:10,522
In summary, I mean, it's you've already spelled it all out. And in that spirit, does that does that kind of answer your answer to your question?

384
00:50:10,522 --> 00:50:20,222
OK. Anything else coming to mind?

385
00:50:20,222 --> 00:50:24,922
I'll prompt you. Samuel, did the discussion on the uncertainty and variability help?

386
00:50:24,922 --> 00:50:45,632
OK, awesome. Perfect. Andrea, if I would use them as an your assessment of the notes, should we find them and you know.

387
00:50:45,632 --> 00:50:57,702
Good question. Uh. Hmm, excellent question.

388
00:50:57,702 --> 00:51:03,282
I guess I would prefer I'm not going to say no that you can't,

389
00:51:03,282 --> 00:51:10,542
but I guess I'd prefer that you're citing the literature as sources in this information and not just,

390
00:51:10,542 --> 00:51:17,412
you know, like electrified slide six, like your 10, slide four.

391
00:51:17,412 --> 00:51:22,152
I mean, this is aimed at an external audience, not I mean, yes, I'm the one creating it.

392
00:51:22,152 --> 00:51:31,692
But I mean, the our exercise here is that we will be submitting these proposals to end reviewers at the at the state of Michigan level.

393
00:51:31,692 --> 00:51:44,582
So, yeah, I try to try to adopt as kind of a professional formal citation as possible and legislative.

394
00:51:44,582 --> 00:51:52,762
Sure, sure. Yeah. That's that's a really good question.

395
00:51:52,762 --> 00:52:01,872
I don't think I had a ready answer for it. I had to think through that one are about is it also appropriate to say, like I said,

396
00:52:01,872 --> 00:52:07,512
some like like government, like CDC fact sheet types of things or like.

397
00:52:07,512 --> 00:52:18,012
Sure. Also even like news article that you're talking about, like the Michigan context specifically in addition to scientific literature.

398
00:52:18,012 --> 00:52:27,012
Yes. So, so great question. I, I'm thinking of where in the paper these might apply or where in the proposal.

399
00:52:27,012 --> 00:52:34,392
Certainly in the introduction. Yeah. Right. You're probably getting most of your information from softer media sources.

400
00:52:34,392 --> 00:52:38,352
Right. Kind of like news stories, news reports, that type of thing.

401
00:52:38,352 --> 00:52:48,092
You will absolutely find some information from government websites, government fact sheets, et cetera.

402
00:52:48,092 --> 00:52:58,272
And then I'm also imagining, you know, the more traditional peer reviewed journal articles will be will be a fair source as well.

403
00:52:58,272 --> 00:53:04,972
So I think I think a mix would almost be expected that that would be very typical of kind

404
00:53:04,972 --> 00:53:12,662
of how the references would fill out to be from a variety of different types of sources.

405
00:53:12,662 --> 00:53:24,172
Yeah, I certainly agree with this, I volunteered to get one hour day like the Cavaliers.

406
00:53:24,172 --> 00:53:34,072
This proposal exists or also going to be able to do that in our with biological clock.

407
00:53:34,072 --> 00:53:39,712
Yeah, so good question. And you're not the only one who's asked that question.

408
00:53:39,712 --> 00:53:46,222
So the way that you stated it was absolutely correct that the reason for me,

409
00:53:46,222 --> 00:53:51,082
including that in the assignment, is that's really just what kick started this.

410
00:53:51,082 --> 00:53:59,602
Right, is that in real or fictional community X, there were there were some residents.

411
00:53:59,602 --> 00:54:08,662
And just to clarify, this is not like the entire community. This is just like a handful of residents that said we're worried about this.

412
00:54:08,662 --> 00:54:18,472
We've heard about this. We're going to we're going to have blood drawn and get our our our blood analyzed for for pithos.

413
00:54:18,472 --> 00:54:28,012
And, wow, we got the results and they're high when we compare them to any other data we can find, you know, nationally.

414
00:54:28,012 --> 00:54:37,042
And so whatever it was, they went to some agency, they went to a news reporter and it got out.

415
00:54:37,042 --> 00:54:41,872
And now, OK, it needs to be addressed.

416
00:54:41,872 --> 00:54:51,932
So you don't need to include those handful of people to, like, somehow account for them through the course of your exposure assessment methodology.

417
00:54:51,932 --> 00:54:58,942
It was just meant to be like an initiator of why we're concerned about it in the first place.

418
00:54:58,942 --> 00:55:08,632
You can absolutely include, for example, you know, if that's appropriate and your and your exposure assessment methodology.

419
00:55:08,632 --> 00:55:17,062
But you but you don't need to, you know, tie it back to or include it or include this specific subgroup in the first place.

420
00:55:17,062 --> 00:55:31,582
Does that does that answer what you're asking about. Yeah. OK, good.

421
00:55:31,582 --> 00:55:40,922
Any other questions the folks at. All right, we can go ahead and there, since we're early in class,

422
00:55:40,922 --> 00:55:51,262
I'll hang out up here for a few minutes in case anyone wants to chat one on one about anything but otherwise, have a great rest of your day.

423
00:55:51,262 --> 00:55:59,714
Good luck getting the assignment submitted. And I'll see you on Thursday.
