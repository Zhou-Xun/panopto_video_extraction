1
00:00:00,490 --> 00:00:05,387
In this session, we're going to talk about the metrics that we can use

2
00:00:05,387 --> 00:00:08,214
to measure linkage to see equilibrium.

3
00:00:08,214 --> 00:00:12,230
Learning objectives are to calculate the metrics of LD,

4
00:00:12,230 --> 00:00:16,172
including D, D prime, and r squared for a pair of loci.

5
00:00:16,172 --> 00:00:18,992
And then interpret those metrics of LD.

6
00:00:18,992 --> 00:00:22,134
We'll also describe why LD changes over time.

7
00:00:22,134 --> 00:00:27,911
And you should be able to calculate how it will change based on a set of parameters.

8
00:00:30,220 --> 00:00:35,125
I'd like to start by drawing a parallel between linkage disequilibrium and

9
00:00:35,125 --> 00:00:37,520
Hardy-Weinberg disequilibrium.

10
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:40,980
Both of these are population-based concepts.

11
00:00:40,980 --> 00:00:45,250
They're not an individual concept or a family-based concept.

12
00:00:45,250 --> 00:00:49,423
So you don't say is an individual in Hardy-Weinberger out of Hardy-Weinberg.

13
00:00:49,423 --> 00:00:53,538
Does an individual have linkage disequilibrium or not?

14
00:00:53,538 --> 00:00:55,040
You don't measure it that way.

15
00:00:55,040 --> 00:00:57,211
It's measured at the population level.

16
00:00:58,390 --> 00:01:01,740
It also has expected and observed values.

17
00:01:01,740 --> 00:01:05,463
So, linkage disequilibrium looks at observed and

18
00:01:05,463 --> 00:01:10,925
expected haplotypes instead of genotypes, like Hardy-Weinberg does.

19
00:01:10,925 --> 00:01:17,189
And the expected haplotype frequencies are calculated from allele frequencies.

20
00:01:17,190 --> 00:01:20,330
So let's take a look at haplotype frequencies.

21
00:01:20,330 --> 00:01:25,539
Let's assume that we have to loci, locus A and locus B.

22
00:01:25,539 --> 00:01:30,670
At locus A, a chromosome can either have a big allele or a small allele.

23
00:01:30,670 --> 00:01:35,236
And at locus B, it can have a big allele or a small B allele.

24
00:01:35,236 --> 00:01:40,671
The haplotype of the chromosome is going to be what it has at locus A and

25
00:01:40,671 --> 00:01:41,630
at locus B.

26
00:01:41,630 --> 00:01:47,690
So the chromosome could have, for example, the big A big B haplotype.

27
00:01:47,690 --> 00:01:54,860
And we would represent that probability as the probability of big A big B.

28
00:01:54,860 --> 00:01:58,422
If the chromosome had a big A small b haplotype,

29
00:01:58,422 --> 00:02:02,347
we could represent the probability as big A small b.

30
00:02:02,347 --> 00:02:04,950
Out here are the allele frequencies.

31
00:02:04,950 --> 00:02:09,344
So, if you didn't know what the haplotype frequencies were here,

32
00:02:09,344 --> 00:02:13,585
you would still know what the allele frequency of the A allele is,

33
00:02:13,585 --> 00:02:16,930
if you were able to measure that in the population.

34
00:02:16,930 --> 00:02:20,302
So, these represent the probability of big allele and

35
00:02:20,302 --> 00:02:23,099
the probability of a small allele at locus A.

36
00:02:23,099 --> 00:02:25,959
And you know that those are gonna sum to one.

37
00:02:25,959 --> 00:02:30,226
And the probability of a big B allele or a small b allele at locus B, and

38
00:02:30,226 --> 00:02:33,034
you know that those are gonna also sum to one.

39
00:02:33,034 --> 00:02:33,100
So what we're going to want to do is, we're gonna look at this frequency,

40
00:02:38,704 --> 00:02:43,212
for example, the probability of the big A big B haplotype.

41
00:02:43,212 --> 00:02:45,870
This is our observed probability.

42
00:02:45,870 --> 00:02:50,956
But we want to compare that to what the expected probability would be

43
00:02:50,956 --> 00:02:56,510
using the allele frequency for big A, and the allele frequency for big B.

44
00:02:56,510 --> 00:03:00,711
If A and B are independent of each other, then we know know that this

45
00:03:00,711 --> 00:03:05,589
probability of having the big A big B haplotype should be just the probability

46
00:03:05,589 --> 00:03:09,752
of having the A allele, times the probability of having the B allele.

47
00:03:10,045 --> 00:03:16,312
If that is equal to the probability of the observed big A big B haplotype,

48
00:03:16,312 --> 00:03:17,642
then those two loci are said to be in linkage equilibrium.

49
00:03:21,368 --> 00:03:27,470
That is, there's no correlation between them, they're independent.

50
00:03:27,470 --> 00:03:28,192
If the probability of having the big A big B haplotype is different

51
00:03:32,556 --> 00:03:37,089
than what we would expect based on the allele frequency for

52
00:03:37,089 --> 00:03:38,559
big A and big B, then that locus is in linkage disequilibrium.

53
00:03:42,020 --> 00:03:44,431
And there is an association between those alleles at those loci.

54
00:03:50,020 --> 00:03:55,004
Before we go on, I just wanted to say something about genotype data.

55
00:03:55,004 --> 00:03:59,301
So, I've been talking about the haplotype on chromosomes.

56
00:03:59,301 --> 00:04:04,456
And remember that we all get one copy of each chromosome from mom and

57
00:04:04,456 --> 00:04:05,950
one copy from dad.

58
00:04:05,950 --> 00:04:11,102
And so at any place on the genome, people are usually gonna have two

59
00:04:11,102 --> 00:04:15,983
copies of any snip or any polymorphism that we're measuring.

60
00:04:15,983 --> 00:04:19,181
And so remember the way that we get genotype data.

61
00:04:19,181 --> 00:04:21,760
Let's say we have genotype data, three markers.

62
00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:25,090
So, the way we get genotype data is something like this.

63
00:04:25,090 --> 00:04:29,270
This person has a C allele and a G allele at Marker1.

64
00:04:29,270 --> 00:04:32,782
They have a C allele and a T allele at Marker2.

65
00:04:32,782 --> 00:04:36,762
They have an A allele and a G allele at Marker3.

66
00:04:36,762 --> 00:04:40,457
So we know the alleles they have, we know their genotypes, but

67
00:04:40,457 --> 00:04:42,492
we don't know their haplotypes.

68
00:04:42,492 --> 00:04:45,761
Because we don't know how they're arranged on the chromosomes.

69
00:04:46,380 --> 00:04:51,614
So if this person, if we measure the C and a G at Marker1, a T and a C at Marker2,

70
00:04:51,614 --> 00:04:55,776
a G and an A at Marker3, this could be one of their haplotypes.

71
00:04:55,776 --> 00:05:02,727
They could have a chromosome that CTG, and their other chromosome would be GCA.

72
00:05:02,727 --> 00:05:06,297
Or, for example, they could have a haplotype for

73
00:05:06,297 --> 00:05:11,488
their first chromosome, that CCG, which would make the other one GTA.

74
00:05:11,488 --> 00:05:15,684
Or they could have this combination, or this combination.

75
00:05:15,684 --> 00:05:19,447
So, when you're actually measuring genotype data,

76
00:05:19,447 --> 00:05:24,354
a lot of times you actually don't know what people's haplotype are for

77
00:05:24,354 --> 00:05:27,234
the low side that you're interested in.

78
00:05:27,234 --> 00:05:32,023
And we can use some complicated algorithms to estimate haplotype

79
00:05:32,023 --> 00:05:34,130
from a set of genotype data.

80
00:05:34,130 --> 00:05:37,550
But it's not something that's usually directly measured.

81
00:05:37,550 --> 00:05:38,008
So let's go back to our probabilities that we talked about before.

82
00:05:42,573 --> 00:05:46,540
And let's talk about the state of linkage equilibrium.

83
00:05:47,506 --> 00:05:51,282
Here, the probability of the AB haplotype.

84
00:05:51,282 --> 00:05:58,286
So this is the frequency of the big A big B haplotype in your population,

85
00:05:58,286 --> 00:06:04,390
is a direct function of the allele frequency of big A and big B.

86
00:06:04,390 --> 00:06:09,591
If these two loci are in linkage equilibrium, then you can directly

87
00:06:09,591 --> 00:06:14,986
estimate these haplotype frequencies from the allele frequencies.

88
00:06:14,986 --> 00:06:18,467
That's expected when you have distant loci.

89
00:06:18,804 --> 00:06:19,842
And these other relationships will hold true.

90
00:06:22,731 --> 00:06:27,661
So the probability of big A times the probability of small b is going to

91
00:06:27,661 --> 00:06:32,506
give you the haplotype frequency first big A small B that you observe

92
00:06:32,506 --> 00:06:36,508
in the population, if there's linkage equilibrium.

93
00:06:36,508 --> 00:06:42,477
And also, the probability of small b is also represented by this equation,

94
00:06:42,477 --> 00:06:43,895
1- PB, right?

95
00:06:43,895 --> 00:06:48,357
Because the probability of small b and big B sum to 1.

96
00:06:48,357 --> 00:06:52,216
So here we have these other relationships, but

97
00:06:52,216 --> 00:06:56,081
they all follow from this first relationship.

98
00:06:56,081 --> 00:06:57,770
So all of these are true.

99
00:06:57,770 --> 00:07:03,455
But we can just kind of think about this one situation for example.

100
00:07:03,455 --> 00:07:08,340
And if you have nearby loci in a large random mating population,

101
00:07:08,340 --> 00:07:13,677
even if you start out with two loci that are in disequilibrium over time

102
00:07:13,677 --> 00:07:18,836
through recombination of generations, eventually the haplotype

103
00:07:18,836 --> 00:07:25,191
frequencies should converge to just this simple function of allele frequencies.

104
00:07:25,191 --> 00:07:29,520
So you should reach linkage equilibrium eventually.

105
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:32,380
So how does linkage disequilibrium happen?

106
00:07:32,380 --> 00:07:34,922
So let's say here you have a snip, and

107
00:07:34,922 --> 00:07:40,258
in the population you have chromosomes that are A at snip one, and C at snip one.

108
00:07:40,258 --> 00:07:43,600
And then you just have some other location in the genome.

109
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:45,809
Then we're gonna represent that by the G allele.

110
00:07:45,809 --> 00:07:46,809
Well, everybody has a G allele.

111
00:07:46,809 --> 00:07:52,841
But then there's a new mutation, and it happens on this haplotype background.

112
00:07:52,841 --> 00:07:57,449
So it happens in the chromosome that has a C at snip one, and

113
00:07:57,449 --> 00:08:01,230
the G allele at snip two is mutated to become a C.

114
00:08:01,230 --> 00:08:05,440
Well, now you have three different kinds of chromosomes in the population.

115
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:10,057
AG is the first haplotype, CG is the second haplotype,

116
00:08:10,057 --> 00:08:12,327
CC is the third haplotype.

117
00:08:12,327 --> 00:08:12,870
Here, this situation where you only have three haplotype

118
00:08:16,774 --> 00:08:20,685
represents a relatively new mutation generally.

119
00:08:20,685 --> 00:08:24,769
Because over time, you'll have recombination, and

120
00:08:24,769 --> 00:08:30,463
you'll get this AC haplotype that didn't exist in the population before.

121
00:08:30,463 --> 00:08:35,771
Because you'll have a recombination event between these

122
00:08:35,771 --> 00:08:40,546
two snips on a chromosome which has an AG haplotype.

123
00:08:40,546 --> 00:08:45,854
And it will recombine for example with this new chromosome CC,

124
00:08:45,854 --> 00:08:50,080
and you'll end up with this fourth haplotype AC.

125
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:50,164
So over time, there will be lots of recombinations in the population.

126
00:08:55,707 --> 00:09:01,514
And eventually, what you'll see is that it won't even look like there's

127
00:09:01,514 --> 00:09:06,963
an association between having the A allele, and having the G allele.

128
00:09:06,963 --> 00:09:12,781
Because now you'll have chromosomes in the population where if you have the A allele,

129
00:09:12,781 --> 00:09:15,302
then you might have the C allele it's sent to.

130
00:09:15,901 --> 00:09:20,947
So linkage disequilibrium is the state of affairs when you've got your allele

131
00:09:20,947 --> 00:09:26,460
frequencies aren't able to reliably predict your haplotype frequencies, right?

132
00:09:26,460 --> 00:09:30,278
So if you have linkage disequilibrium, the observed and

133
00:09:30,278 --> 00:09:33,549
expected haplotype frequencies are not equal.

134
00:09:33,549 --> 00:09:36,158
And so you see the not equal sign here.

135
00:09:36,158 --> 00:09:39,558
And just like we saw with linkage equilibrium,

136
00:09:39,558 --> 00:09:44,500
if you have disequilibrium, all these relationships will be true.

137
00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:49,578
You won't be able to predict, for example, the big A small b haplotype

138
00:09:49,578 --> 00:09:54,340
frequency based on the probabilities of the alleles themselves.

139
00:09:54,340 --> 00:09:54,522
So what are some of the fundamental ways that we can measure disequilibrium?

140
00:09:59,570 --> 00:09:59,659
One of the most important ways is called the disequilibrium coefficient,

141
00:10:03,579 --> 00:10:06,515
that's our fundamental measure of disequilibrium.

142
00:10:06,515 --> 00:10:10,494
And then there are two other measures that are commonly used,

143
00:10:10,494 --> 00:10:13,971
D prime or the absolute value of D prime, and r squared.

144
00:10:14,110 --> 00:10:18,261
First, we're gonna talk about the disequilibrium coefficient D.

145
00:10:18,261 --> 00:10:23,065
So, we've got this table set up like we had before.

146
00:10:23,065 --> 00:10:27,895
We can calculate D, and specifically D with respect

147
00:10:27,895 --> 00:10:30,301
to looking at the big A big B haplotype.

148
00:10:31,540 --> 00:10:39,361
So the disequilibrium between them is the observed haplotype frequency for

149
00:10:39,361 --> 00:10:45,980
big A big B,- the expected haplotype frequency for big A big B.

150
00:10:45,980 --> 00:10:51,784
So we've got, the disequilibrium is equal to the observed

151
00:10:51,784 --> 00:10:56,319
haplotype frequency at AB,- the expected.

152
00:10:56,319 --> 00:10:57,044
If this relationship is true, which it is, if this relationship exists, then you

153
00:11:02,344 --> 00:11:08,211
can actually calculate all of the other relationships that I'm showing below.

154
00:11:08,211 --> 00:11:13,140
So the probability of having a big A big B haplotype is just gonna be a function of

155
00:11:13,140 --> 00:11:17,494
those little frequencies, plus the disequilibrium coefficient.

156
00:11:17,494 --> 00:11:21,899
That's the same thing we just saw, just rearranging some of these terms above.

157
00:11:21,899 --> 00:11:26,640
And then you can calculate the probability of each of these other observed allele,

158
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:27,393
I'm sorry.

159
00:11:27,393 --> 00:11:31,569
Each of these other observed haplotype frequencies are also going to be

160
00:11:31,569 --> 00:11:34,980
a function of their expected haplotype frequencies, and

161
00:11:34,980 --> 00:11:37,412
the disequilibrium coefficient.

162
00:11:37,660 --> 00:11:41,173
So once you calculate the disequilibrium coefficient for

163
00:11:42,209 --> 00:11:46,104
two pretty arbitrary alleles like big A and big B,

164
00:11:46,104 --> 00:11:51,762
then you also know what the relationship is for all of the other alleles,

165
00:11:51,762 --> 00:11:55,622
like the haplotype small A small B, for example.

166
00:11:55,690 --> 00:11:59,320
But there are some problems with the disequilibrium coefficient.

167
00:11:59,320 --> 00:12:00,433
There are two problems.

168
00:12:00,433 --> 00:12:03,339
First of all, the sign is arbitrary.

169
00:12:03,339 --> 00:12:07,794
So, what you choose for A and B is relatively arbitrary.

170
00:12:07,794 --> 00:12:11,978
So you could choose, like the C allele is gonna be big A, and

171
00:12:11,978 --> 00:12:14,109
the T allele is gonna be small A.

172
00:12:14,254 --> 00:12:18,918
Usually we choose big A and big B to be the more common alleles for

173
00:12:18,918 --> 00:12:24,650
the snips that you're looking at, and small A small B to be the rare alleles.

174
00:12:24,650 --> 00:12:29,276
But if you were to reverse that notation, it also changes the sign of the AB.

175
00:12:29,276 --> 00:12:32,760
And so we say that the sign is arbitrary.

176
00:12:32,760 --> 00:12:37,200
More importantly, I think the range of that disequilibrium coefficient really

177
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:39,240
depends on the allele frequencies.

178
00:12:39,240 --> 00:12:43,989
And so if you're trying to look at the linkage disequilibrium

179
00:12:43,989 --> 00:12:46,820
across different pairs of markers,

180
00:12:46,820 --> 00:12:52,864
DAB is going to vary based on the minor allele frequencies that those markers.

181
00:12:52,864 --> 00:12:57,027
So it's hard to really compare across markers and

182
00:12:57,027 --> 00:13:01,110
see what has stronger linkage disequilibrium.

183
00:13:01,110 --> 00:13:01,495
So we've got the fundamental measure D which is hard to interpret.

184
00:13:05,636 --> 00:13:10,401
And then we're gonna talk about these other measures, D prime and r squared.

185
00:13:10,401 --> 00:13:15,240
So what's really nice about these measures is that they're frequency normalized.

186
00:13:15,240 --> 00:13:21,302
So they're less sensitive, maybe not completely unsensitive, but

187
00:13:21,302 --> 00:13:28,310
less sensitive to having extreme values based on the minor allele frequencies.

188
00:13:28,310 --> 00:13:32,300
And also if you take the absolute value of D prime,

189
00:13:32,300 --> 00:13:37,440
the absolute value of D Prime and r squared are always positive.

190
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:43,510
So this is nice because you can facilitate comparison across markers.

191
00:13:43,510 --> 00:13:46,098
Just note though that like I said,

192
00:13:46,098 --> 00:13:51,474
the measures are still not perfect in their frequency normalization.

193
00:13:51,474 --> 00:13:55,727
So for example, the maximum value of r squared depends a little bit on

194
00:13:55,727 --> 00:14:00,071
the differences in minor allele frequency of the evaluated markers.

195
00:14:00,071 --> 00:14:04,711
So they're much better metrics, but they're still not perfect for

196
00:14:04,711 --> 00:14:06,311
comparing across loci.

197
00:14:06,890 --> 00:14:09,134
D prime is kind of nice.

198
00:14:09,134 --> 00:14:13,755
A lot of times when we look at the linkage disequilibrium of snips,

199
00:14:13,755 --> 00:14:17,894
we use both the metric of D prime and the metric of r squared.

200
00:14:17,894 --> 00:14:21,310
Because it gives us sort of different information.

201
00:14:21,310 --> 00:14:27,326
So, D prime is a version of D that's scaled to be its maximum value,

202
00:14:27,326 --> 00:14:31,669
and it's scaled using the allele frequencies.

203
00:14:31,669 --> 00:14:35,040
D prime actually ranges between -1 and +1.

204
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:38,667
And when you have allele frequencies that are small,

205
00:14:38,667 --> 00:14:41,830
D prime is actually more likely to be extreme.

206
00:14:41,830 --> 00:14:46,982
So D prime, even though it's frequency normalized,

207
00:14:46,982 --> 00:14:51,350
you still get a situation where it's somewhat

208
00:14:51,350 --> 00:14:55,840
dependent on those minor allele frequencies.

209
00:14:55,840 --> 00:14:59,733
So, if you have a D prime of -1 or +1,

210
00:14:59,733 --> 00:15:05,936
it implies that at least one of the haplotype wasn't observed.

211
00:15:05,936 --> 00:15:10,799
So for example, we saw the situation where you have a new mutation,

212
00:15:10,799 --> 00:15:14,227
now you have three haplotypes in a population.

213
00:15:14,227 --> 00:15:20,152
You don't see the fourth one that would cause D prime to be high or

214
00:15:20,152 --> 00:15:23,788
low, either toward -1 or toward +1.

215
00:15:24,008 --> 00:15:29,126
D prime is calculated by starting with the metric D.

216
00:15:29,126 --> 00:15:31,588
So you first calculate D.

217
00:15:31,588 --> 00:15:38,086
And if you find that D is less than 0, then you use this equation,

218
00:15:38,086 --> 00:15:42,118
this top equation to calculate D prime.

219
00:15:42,118 --> 00:15:45,177
If you find that D is greater than 0,

220
00:15:45,177 --> 00:15:49,292
you use the bottom equation to calculate D prime.

221
00:15:49,350 --> 00:15:53,190
So let's say that DAB is greater than 0.

222
00:15:53,190 --> 00:16:00,205
To calculate D prime, it would be DAB over whichever of these is the minimum.

223
00:16:00,205 --> 00:16:05,077
If you multiply the allele frequency of big A and small B, or

224
00:16:05,077 --> 00:16:09,949
if you multiply the allele frequency of small A times big B,

225
00:16:09,949 --> 00:16:12,410
which of those are smallest?

226
00:16:12,410 --> 00:16:18,272
If you find that this probability, big A small B is smallest,

227
00:16:18,272 --> 00:16:25,970
then D prime is DAB over the probability of big A times the probability of small B.

228
00:16:25,970 --> 00:16:26,128
On this slide, we have some data on the absolute value of

229
00:16:30,930 --> 00:16:34,018
D prime from chromosome 22.

230
00:16:34,250 --> 00:16:38,774
This plot is representing pairs of snips that are a certain

231
00:16:38,774 --> 00:16:41,279
distance away from each other.

232
00:16:41,279 --> 00:16:47,252
So, you could have the pair of snips be very, very close to each other,

233
00:16:47,252 --> 00:16:51,678
or even all the way up to 1 mega base away from each other.

234
00:16:52,048 --> 00:16:55,069
On the y-axis, your absolute value of D prime.

235
00:16:55,069 --> 00:16:59,981
So what you see is that when you look at pairs of snips that are pretty

236
00:16:59,981 --> 00:17:04,826
close together, a lot of them have pretty high values of D prime.

237
00:17:04,826 --> 00:17:09,497
And that means that that there's evidence of linkage disequilibrium,

238
00:17:09,497 --> 00:17:13,717
especially for snips that are close together on the chromosome.

239
00:17:13,717 --> 00:17:18,112
Because they haven't had time to be separated by recombination in

240
00:17:18,112 --> 00:17:20,001
the generations over time.

241
00:17:21,150 --> 00:17:23,655
What we also see is that, even for

242
00:17:23,655 --> 00:17:28,780
some snips that are really far away, they still have a high D prime.

243
00:17:28,780 --> 00:17:32,462
And that means that there might be the situation where there's the three

244
00:17:32,462 --> 00:17:34,050
haplotype in the population.

245
00:17:34,050 --> 00:17:36,960
So we don't see the fourth haplotype.

246
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:41,365
This could be because the minor allele frequencies of at least one of these snips

247
00:17:41,365 --> 00:17:42,320
are really rare.

248
00:17:42,359 --> 00:17:48,981
R squared is another metric that we use, and it ranges between 0 and 1.

249
00:17:48,981 --> 00:17:52,920
So it's really just the squared correlation coefficient.

250
00:17:52,920 --> 00:17:57,926
R squared equals 1 when the markers provide identical information.

251
00:17:57,926 --> 00:18:03,480
And r squared equals 0 when the markers are completely independent of each other.

252
00:18:03,480 --> 00:18:08,646
So, r squared equals 0 is linkage equilibrium,

253
00:18:08,646 --> 00:18:14,070
and r squared equals 1 is linkage disequilibrium.

254
00:18:14,070 --> 00:18:14,108
R squared is nice,

255
00:18:15,265 --> 00:18:21,180
because it's not as strongly affected by those extremely allele frequencies.

256
00:18:21,180 --> 00:18:24,095
The way that you calculate r squared is you take D,

257
00:18:24,095 --> 00:18:26,396
and you square that as your numerator.

258
00:18:26,396 --> 00:18:30,623
And then you multiply it by all four of the allele frequencies that you're

259
00:18:30,623 --> 00:18:31,390
looking at.

260
00:18:31,390 --> 00:18:35,082
So probability be big A allele, probability small a allele,

261
00:18:35,082 --> 00:18:38,491
probability big B allele, probability small b allele.

262
00:18:39,790 --> 00:18:44,480
Here's some data from chromosome 22, those same snip pairs we looked at before.

263
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:47,948
Here's your physical distance in kb, and here's r squared.

264
00:18:47,948 --> 00:18:53,506
So what you can see is that snip pairs that are closer together actually tend to

265
00:18:53,506 --> 00:18:59,426
be the ones that have the higher r squared values, or the higher disequilibrium.

266
00:18:59,426 --> 00:19:00,779
And that makes sense.

267
00:19:00,779 --> 00:19:05,638
Because the ones that are closer together are the ones that are more likely to have

268
00:19:05,638 --> 00:19:08,230
not recombined over a lot of generations.

269
00:19:08,230 --> 00:19:09,508
So as you can see,

270
00:19:09,508 --> 00:19:14,650
the linkage disequilibrium tracks somewhat with physical distance.

271
00:19:14,650 --> 00:19:20,834
So you expect that the closer two snips together are, the more likely that they

272
00:19:20,834 --> 00:19:23,466
might be in disequilibrium if at least one of them was a relatively new mutation.

273
00:19:27,980 --> 00:19:33,161
And when you get further away, you expect to see less linkage disequilibrium,

274
00:19:33,161 --> 00:19:37,349
because recombination is more able to break these up over time.

275
00:19:37,349 --> 00:19:37,639
So to put the information together, we're gonna put together

276
00:19:41,483 --> 00:19:45,855
information from the absolute value of D prime and from r squared.

277
00:19:45,855 --> 00:19:50,261
When the absolute value of D prime is high and the r squared is high,

278
00:19:50,261 --> 00:19:54,906
this indicates the tendency toward the presence of only two haplotype

279
00:19:54,906 --> 00:19:58,235
with similar allele frequencies of the two loci.

280
00:19:58,240 --> 00:20:02,252
If you have a situation where D prime is high but r squared is low,

281
00:20:02,252 --> 00:20:07,110
that's the situation where you have the presence of only three haplotypes.

282
00:20:07,110 --> 00:20:13,000
So you've got one of the markers is a new mutation or a young snip ancestrally.

283
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:15,988
And there's a pretty big difference in allele frequencies.

284
00:20:16,120 --> 00:20:19,524
And when you have D prime low and r squared low,

285
00:20:19,524 --> 00:20:24,762
it indicates the tendency towards the presence of all four haplotype,

286
00:20:24,762 --> 00:20:29,231
the random coupling of alleles, and linkage equilibrium.

287
00:20:30,420 --> 00:20:32,409
So let's put all of this together.

288
00:20:32,776 --> 00:20:35,841
Snips are shown across the top here.

289
00:20:35,841 --> 00:20:40,110
So these are snips or actually in this case, it's a micro-satellite marker.

290
00:20:40,110 --> 00:20:43,690
But these are snips that are on a chromosome, and

291
00:20:43,690 --> 00:20:47,200
this is their direction along the chromosome.

292
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:51,007
And we're looking at their r squared values, and

293
00:20:51,007 --> 00:20:53,551
their absolute value of D prime.

294
00:20:53,551 --> 00:20:58,310
These are s numbers are how we give names to snips.

295
00:20:58,310 --> 00:21:02,823
So this is a particular snip represented by this particular rs number.

296
00:21:03,043 --> 00:21:05,790
In this plot, we're looking at pairs of snips.

297
00:21:05,790 --> 00:21:10,490
So, if you wanna know the r squared value between snip 1 and

298
00:21:10,490 --> 00:21:15,002
this other marker which we'll call snip 2, Marker2,

299
00:21:15,002 --> 00:21:19,720
the r squared value says 43 and it's a little bit shaded.

300
00:21:19,720 --> 00:21:23,440
So that means that the r squared is 0.43.

301
00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:23,648
The r squared value between this snip, snip 1 and step 3, it has a 1.

302
00:21:29,311 --> 00:21:33,060
That means that the r squared is 0.01.

303
00:21:33,060 --> 00:21:40,666
So that's very little linkage disequilibrium between those two snips.

304
00:21:40,704 --> 00:21:44,640
This one here, you've got a pretty high level of linkage

305
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:49,235
disequilibrium between step 4 and step 5, it says 50.87.

306
00:21:49,235 --> 00:21:51,271
That means the r squared is 0.87.

307
00:21:51,271 --> 00:21:56,240
So the darker the cell is, the more disequilibrium there is between

308
00:21:56,240 --> 00:21:59,480
those two pairs of snips in the population.

309
00:21:59,480 --> 00:22:02,670
You can also look at the value of D prime along with that.

310
00:22:02,670 --> 00:22:06,115
So right here if you look at marker 4 and 5,

311
00:22:06,115 --> 00:22:11,171
the value of D prime is also really high, it's 95, or 0.95.

312
00:22:11,450 --> 00:22:16,864
We looked over here at r squared between marker 1 and 3, and it was really low.

313
00:22:16,864 --> 00:22:21,391
If you look at D prime between marker 1 and 3, it's 0.74.

314
00:22:21,391 --> 00:22:23,409
So it's a little bit on the higher side.

315
00:22:23,409 --> 00:22:28,113
So for example for this snip, you've got a very low r squared, and

316
00:22:28,113 --> 00:22:29,716
a pretty high D prime.

317
00:22:29,716 --> 00:22:34,845
And that means that there's probably either snip 1 or snip 3, one of them has

318
00:22:34,845 --> 00:22:39,770
a really low minor allele frequency, and it's a young snip ancestrally.

319
00:22:39,770 --> 00:22:47,684
And that there was only 3 haplotypes present in the population.

320
00:22:48,050 --> 00:22:52,112
The last thing that we'll talk about is that linkage disequilibrium decays

321
00:22:52,112 --> 00:22:52,760
over time.

322
00:22:52,760 --> 00:22:57,613
So if you've got some chromosome and you're looking at

323
00:22:57,613 --> 00:23:02,270
the marker on the chromosome, you'll always know.

324
00:23:02,270 --> 00:23:07,485
For example, you'll know if they have a C allele here at this snip,

325
00:23:07,485 --> 00:23:10,869
they're gonna have the A allele at snip 2,

326
00:23:10,869 --> 00:23:14,748
and the C allele at snip 3, and the T allele at snip 4.

327
00:23:15,090 --> 00:23:19,487
Over time, you'll get recombination events between this allele and

328
00:23:19,487 --> 00:23:22,490
all of the other alleles along the chromosome.

329
00:23:22,490 --> 00:23:24,797
And so if you look at present day chromosomes,

330
00:23:24,797 --> 00:23:27,174
here's your ancestral chromosome in yellow.

331
00:23:27,174 --> 00:23:30,123
If you look at the chromosomes in the population today,

332
00:23:30,123 --> 00:23:32,961
they'll have the stretch of ancestral chromosome.

333
00:23:32,961 --> 00:23:35,678
But then there will have been a recombination event.

334
00:23:35,678 --> 00:23:38,602
And they'll have some other ancestral chromosome kind of upstream of this place,

335
00:23:40,617 --> 00:23:44,106
and a different ancestral chromosome downstream of that place.

336
00:23:44,510 --> 00:23:49,823
So, the stretch of chromosome that's actually ancestral is smaller and

337
00:23:49,823 --> 00:23:54,461
smaller in present day chromosomes as the generations were on.

338
00:23:54,461 --> 00:23:59,538
Because there's more recombination between this locus and the loci next to it.

339
00:23:59,538 --> 00:24:04,994
So even if you start out with a situation where there's a correlation between this

340
00:24:04,994 --> 00:24:10,545
locus, and say a locus over here, over time, that recombination will wear away.

341
00:24:10,545 --> 00:24:13,730
A nd we can actually measure that by generations.

342
00:24:13,730 --> 00:24:18,097
So, it's dependent on what the disequilibrium was to

343
00:24:18,903 --> 00:24:23,980
start with, and the recombination fraction theta.

344
00:24:23,980 --> 00:24:25,900
Or we can call it r.

345
00:24:25,900 --> 00:24:28,191
So if you have a really high r and

346
00:24:28,191 --> 00:24:28,418
these two loci start out highly linked like with a G prime of 1,

347
00:24:32,863 --> 00:24:38,971
the recombination will degrade that association or that correlation over time.

348
00:24:38,971 --> 00:24:44,774
And by ten generations, you won't have any correlation between those two loci,

349
00:24:44,774 --> 00:24:46,583
between those two alleles.

350
00:24:46,804 --> 00:24:51,281
So here's the formula to calculate what the new metric of

351
00:24:51,281 --> 00:24:53,997
linkage disequilibrium will be.

352
00:24:53,997 --> 00:24:59,499
If you start with an initial linkage disequilibrium coefficient D0.

353
00:24:59,499 --> 00:25:03,617
And if you have a recombination fraction theta,

354
00:25:03,617 --> 00:25:09,360
then you multiply D0 times 1- theta raised to the t generations.

355
00:25:09,360 --> 00:25:12,683
And you'll get the new disequilibrium coefficient.

356
00:25:12,835 --> 00:25:17,281
So again, the disequilibrium will decay with each generation.

357
00:25:17,281 --> 00:25:20,542
And after t generations, this is the result.

358
00:25:20,542 --> 00:25:25,537
The disequilibrium coefficient after t generations as 1- theta to the t,

359
00:25:25,537 --> 00:25:28,390
times the initial disequilibrium.

360
00:25:28,390 --> 00:25:31,766
You can do this with D, or with D prime.

361
00:25:32,020 --> 00:25:37,265
And eventually after many generations, you should see that random mating and

362
00:25:37,265 --> 00:25:42,930
recombination will ensure that all four haplotype become present in a population.

363
00:25:42,930 --> 00:25:47,502
And even if you start in a state of linkage disequilibrium,

364
00:25:47,502 --> 00:25:52,911
eventually those two loci will reach a state of linkage equilibrium.
