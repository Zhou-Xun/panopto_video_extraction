1
00:00:01,890 --> 00:00:05,450
All right. For those of you on the recording that started a little late, there's one side missing.

2
00:00:05,460 --> 00:00:06,600
Make sure you look at it. All right.

3
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:17,770
So odds ratio of less than one is a negative associations, possibly protective over interpretation of the odds ratio.

4
00:00:17,770 --> 00:00:27,059
Recurrence ratio of two is the odds of disease and exposed is two times the odds in the unexposed or the odds of disease in the exposed.

5
00:00:27,060 --> 00:00:30,570
20.5 times the odds in the unexposed.

6
00:00:33,730 --> 00:00:39,100
And we will talk about why you're doing an exposure versus a disease kind of interpretation.

7
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:47,940
Of course, you usually want to get at the other one. So August from a two by three table, the odds of disease exposure among the disease rate.

8
00:00:47,980 --> 00:00:52,450
That's going to be a over see. What about the odds of exposure among the novel disease?

9
00:00:53,330 --> 00:01:01,470
What will that be? From that table, you'll be over me.

10
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:05,400
Yeah. All right. The odds of disease among the exposed.

11
00:01:10,310 --> 00:01:16,520
Take a over be right in the odds of disease among the unexposed.

12
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:23,410
Celebrities. Right. Okay. So that.

13
00:01:24,820 --> 00:01:27,090
So calculate the odds when I'm doing odds ratio.

14
00:01:27,100 --> 00:01:34,870
At least the odds if there are 40 people in the room and ten people have a cold, what is the odds of having the cold if you are in the bathroom?

15
00:01:49,580 --> 00:01:55,260
Yep. Ten over 30, right. 1030 or 4.33.

16
00:01:56,130 --> 00:02:04,650
Okay. So an odds ratio is quite simply a ratio of ratios to the odds of one group divided by the odds of another group.

17
00:02:04,650 --> 00:02:12,360
So the proportion exposed here divided by one minus the proportion exposed over the proportion not exposed divided by one,

18
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:14,220
minus the proportion not exposed.

19
00:02:15,870 --> 00:02:24,810
And one of the really nice things about the odds ratio is that the disease odds ratio is actually equal to the exposure odds ratio.

20
00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:27,299
And why is that nice?

21
00:02:27,300 --> 00:02:35,130
It's very nice because that allows us to do what kind of your classic case control study, which is really one of the first designs that people do.

22
00:02:35,490 --> 00:02:45,450
I did. And it's something that's used still not as much in the literature for sure,

23
00:02:45,450 --> 00:02:50,640
but you see it a lot still with outbreaks, early outbreaks, you'll see a lot of kind of classic case control studies.

24
00:02:52,020 --> 00:02:58,200
So for a disease odds ratio here, right, we've just the same thing we did before rates.

25
00:02:58,290 --> 00:03:02,010
We got a over A plus B over B over a plus fee.

26
00:03:02,750 --> 00:03:12,569
That's our total over here, which is A over B on the bottom we've got C or unexposed over the total number,

27
00:03:12,570 --> 00:03:18,840
the proportion of disease unexposed straight divided by the total number of unexposed people

28
00:03:20,070 --> 00:03:28,170
here the number of disease unexposed people divided by the number of unexposed people.

29
00:03:28,590 --> 00:03:35,909
So you get A over B, over C, over D, which when you simplify is eight times D over B times C, right?

30
00:03:35,910 --> 00:03:40,080
And that's our disease off ratio. That's what we usually kind of want to get at.

31
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:47,550
But most of the time in studies we're actually in, at least in the case control studies,

32
00:03:47,940 --> 00:03:51,870
we're really kind of getting up this exposure odds ratio, right?

33
00:03:51,870 --> 00:04:00,719
So now same thing, right? But we end up with a over A-plus C over C, over A plus C, it's actually going down here over a,

34
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:10,110
B or B plus de over the So over D, over B plus speed is hard to say.

35
00:04:10,350 --> 00:04:14,610
So we end up with a receipt right divided by B over D and while.

36
00:04:14,610 --> 00:04:25,440
All right, little magic, we end up with the same formula 820 over ten times C this formula you should know like, you know,

37
00:04:25,710 --> 00:04:30,990
immediately, probably a lot of you already have that memorized, but you should certainly have that memorized for this class.

38
00:04:30,990 --> 00:04:36,809
Right. And just for the future. Okay. So calculate the odds ratio.

39
00:04:36,810 --> 00:04:43,590
This is from like you. Probably like really the original or might have been the second study,

40
00:04:43,590 --> 00:04:51,140
I think it was the original one to actually show that smoking was associated with lung cancer.

41
00:05:47,770 --> 00:05:53,020
All right. So we're going to do eight times D over B and C, right?

42
00:05:53,500 --> 00:05:58,960
And we end up with 9.1, but everybody gets 9.1.

43
00:05:59,580 --> 00:06:07,210
Then we're going to interpret it. The odds of developing lung cancer among smokers is 9.1 times the odds of developing lung cancer among nonsmokers.

44
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:15,190
I would note here that technically this is not the correct interpretation of this because we are doing an exposure odds ratio.

45
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:21,070
So I turned it around here as a side note in part to point it out.

46
00:06:21,310 --> 00:06:26,080
Also, you know, you feel a little bit okay doing that if in fact it is something that's super causal.

47
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:29,709
But here in in 601, I don't want you do that.

48
00:06:29,710 --> 00:06:35,740
I should have a slide actually that kind of says it out and you actually interpret it as an exposure odds ratio.

49
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:42,400
So on that front, when you turn to somebody around you or you can pick it in your head if you don't

50
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:47,560
want to talk to anybody around you and interpret that as an exposure odds ratio.

51
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:38,330
Somebody want to shout out their answer. Yeah.

52
00:07:39,020 --> 00:07:42,230
We were talking about. Seems to.

53
00:07:49,960 --> 00:07:53,800
Being exposed home. So it's not quite that.

54
00:07:53,800 --> 00:08:00,970
So when you when you interpret an exposure odds ratio, you're going to stay among the exposed.

55
00:08:01,330 --> 00:08:10,860
Right. Right. This is the odds of of so sorry.

56
00:08:11,740 --> 00:08:15,490
Among those with lung cancer. This is the odds of smoking.

57
00:08:15,490 --> 00:08:22,569
Right. Is hard to interpret it as messed up. But anyways, we'll go through a few examples in the class where I am interpreting them appropriately.

58
00:08:22,570 --> 00:08:26,500
And then towards the end of the slide deck, we actually have some.

59
00:08:26,500 --> 00:08:31,270
In case you struggle with the interpretation, I've got it like highlighted in different colors.

60
00:08:31,270 --> 00:08:37,569
You just sub out, you know, it'll say the number, you know, whatever measure right now be in blue.

61
00:08:37,570 --> 00:08:40,870
So you just know that you sub that out for whatever you're looking at. All right?

62
00:08:41,950 --> 00:08:54,900
Okay. Um. So the odds of being a smoker among lung cancer cases is 9.1 times the odds of being a smoker among controls.

63
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:59,400
Right. And that's not really what we want to get at. But there there it is.

64
00:08:59,460 --> 00:09:03,330
Okay. But the nice thing is that they're actually the same.

65
00:09:03,660 --> 00:09:06,690
Right. So. So we can do that.

66
00:09:06,960 --> 00:09:12,480
All right. So let's quickly calculate the odds ratio for this this problem.

67
00:10:37,140 --> 00:10:43,530
All right. So the first step in the process is always to set up your two by two table.

68
00:10:43,950 --> 00:10:50,280
Right. And if you get an answer that differs from what the correct answer is, most likely it could be a math error.

69
00:10:50,440 --> 00:10:57,730
Right. That happens. But most likely the issue is if you were calculating the right measure, that's one of the other big things that we have.

70
00:10:57,750 --> 00:11:02,309
Our measure of association is that you set up your two by two table incorrectly,

71
00:11:02,310 --> 00:11:05,430
so make sure you pay attention to how you're setting up those two two tables,

72
00:11:05,880 --> 00:11:10,950
or at least that you're using the appropriate formula for how you set up your tables.

73
00:11:12,030 --> 00:11:18,630
All right. So we get a times D over time, C, which is 25 times 100 divided by 50 times 25.

74
00:11:18,930 --> 00:11:24,440
So we get an odds ratio two. All right.

75
00:11:25,500 --> 00:11:34,050
So prevalence odds ratio as the odds ratio of prevalent cases, uh, is calculated the same way as an odds ratio.

76
00:11:34,260 --> 00:11:44,190
The prevalence odds ratio is actually equal to the incidence density rate times the duration of

77
00:11:44,190 --> 00:11:50,490
survival in the exposed people divided by the duration of survival in the unexposed individuals.

78
00:11:53,910 --> 00:11:59,340
I think this is one of the ones that Eduardo doesn't like this.

79
00:12:00,230 --> 00:12:04,580
But in 600, this one is he doesn't like operations in general.

80
00:12:05,390 --> 00:12:10,040
Yes. Okay. So in 600, you may have learned that maybe you shouldn't use odds ratios.

81
00:12:10,250 --> 00:12:20,000
There certainly are some limitations for them. I believe they're a really good tool, I think in particular in 600 as against this one.

82
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,590
But maybe that's not the case anymore.

83
00:12:21,800 --> 00:12:27,320
I would argue that like you get rid of the entire field of genetic epidemiology if you don't like the prevalence ratio.

84
00:12:27,320 --> 00:12:30,979
Right. So like there's a slight problem there, I think.

85
00:12:30,980 --> 00:12:35,870
But there you go. So there are some differences between 606 or one.

86
00:12:36,080 --> 00:12:38,720
I will try to do the best job I can at pointing them out.

87
00:12:39,020 --> 00:12:45,610
I know sometimes people are taking both classes at the same time and you know, it's not always great if we disagree.

88
00:12:45,620 --> 00:12:54,320
But, you know, in real, in life, there are people who have different intellectual ideas about, you know, one on one topic or theme.

89
00:12:54,890 --> 00:13:02,810
So I think there's a lot of value there as well. And if any of you notice anything for me that differs from 600.

90
00:13:03,770 --> 00:13:07,220
I do have a former 600 year science hero, right? Yeah.

91
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:13,010
Who probably does that good. Feel free to point it out. I do like to kind of highlighted a little bit.

92
00:13:13,640 --> 00:13:17,180
You'll usually go if you go and look, you will see that in the literature.

93
00:13:17,510 --> 00:13:20,600
There are plenty of people who take both positions on that, on that issue.

94
00:13:22,430 --> 00:13:25,790
And you, as you go on in your career, will make up your own minds.

95
00:13:25,790 --> 00:13:33,500
Right? Okay. So interpreting the odds ratio is incorrect to interpret the odds ratio as a risk ratio.

96
00:13:34,460 --> 00:13:40,670
However, if the disease is rare, then the odds ratio is going to approximate the risk ratio.

97
00:13:41,690 --> 00:13:45,590
There are exceptions to the rare disease assumption. We'll talk about some of those.

98
00:13:45,770 --> 00:13:48,830
Stay tuned. It depends on the control selection mechanism.

99
00:13:49,100 --> 00:13:55,340
And so there are certain ways that you can set up your study where the odds ratio would actually, for example, approximate the IDR.

100
00:13:56,090 --> 00:14:09,169
But that will come a little bit later. All right. So when we compare the odds ratio and the risk ratio here, right here, we've got one across here.

101
00:14:09,170 --> 00:14:21,960
Right. What you see is that the more extreme, the the relative risk gets right and the more prevalent are,

102
00:14:21,980 --> 00:14:28,219
the higher the incidence among the unexposed as the less rare the disease is, the more prevalent the disease is.

103
00:14:28,220 --> 00:14:31,430
From the first right, we're going to start kind of veering off.

104
00:14:31,430 --> 00:14:33,530
So it's quite good when it's rare.

105
00:14:33,830 --> 00:14:42,709
Odds ratio is approximately equal to the relative risk, but as it gets more common, does that work very well for you?

106
00:14:42,710 --> 00:14:50,120
So batteries replaced, right? We see them kind of veering off and you're going to get this inflation of the odds ratio occurring.

107
00:14:51,110 --> 00:14:54,259
This is also inflation of the odds ratio down here.

108
00:14:54,260 --> 00:14:56,840
Right. Because as we get smaller, right, it's getting more protective.

109
00:15:01,470 --> 00:15:11,880
So whenever you can calculate any measure, the preference would be certainly to do an ADR over an odds ratio, for example.

110
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:17,940
Right. Because we know that it is going to kind of inflate the relationship,

111
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:22,320
although all ratios are nice and fast and you memorize a formula, you can quickly.

112
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:27,390
And so sometimes you do that as kind of a personal check and then move on right on the back of the napkin.

113
00:15:27,630 --> 00:15:34,200
So one more note. The odds ratio of an event is the reciprocal of the odds ratio of a nonevent.

114
00:15:35,310 --> 00:15:38,340
That's relationship is not seen in the relative risk.

115
00:15:40,350 --> 00:15:45,229
Okay. So those are relative measures that we've gone through.

116
00:15:45,230 --> 00:15:59,090
And now we're going to talk about our absolute measures. So we've got our risk difference, which is actually we will call attributable growth here.

117
00:15:59,110 --> 00:16:02,970
You can call it either way, as is is fine generally.

118
00:16:03,930 --> 00:16:11,940
So we've got a attributable risk, attributable risk, percent population attributable risk and then population attributable risk percentage.

119
00:16:14,970 --> 00:16:18,570
So we've got absolute measures of association and we have impact measures.

120
00:16:19,530 --> 00:16:28,950
So if a exposure is truly causal, then an absolute measure of association is really an impact measure, right?

121
00:16:28,950 --> 00:16:37,980
You can interpret it causally. The terms absolute measure and impact measure are often used interchangeably.

122
00:16:38,370 --> 00:16:43,050
You will see them used interchangeably and even sort of, you know, in textbooks and other things.

123
00:16:43,950 --> 00:16:54,180
However, they're not really, truly interchangeable because impact is causal, right, and absolute is association.

124
00:16:56,940 --> 00:17:02,250
Okay. So risk differences. So we've got our different measures, right?

125
00:17:02,520 --> 00:17:07,290
And for any of those measures, we can do a risk difference for any of these areas.

126
00:17:07,500 --> 00:17:10,770
So we've got instance density difference, right?

127
00:17:11,130 --> 00:17:14,580
And mortality rate difference and can do a prevalence difference.

128
00:17:15,180 --> 00:17:21,720
Right. The risk difference is simply the risk in one group minus the risk in another group.

129
00:17:22,650 --> 00:17:27,650
And I'm using one or two here instead of exposed and unexposed because you can actually swap, you know,

130
00:17:27,660 --> 00:17:34,739
like you might use the the unexposed might actually have a higher risk than the exposed, right?

131
00:17:34,740 --> 00:17:44,730
So you can swap their own risk difference is going to be dimensionless and it's going to range from -1 to 1.

132
00:17:45,990 --> 00:17:56,760
So for the incidence density difference, we've got the incidence density in one group minus the incidence density in another group.

133
00:17:57,300 --> 00:17:59,670
It's also called the incidence of rate difference.

134
00:18:00,060 --> 00:18:07,620
The dimensions are going to be one over time of that is you're going to say per year often, but it could be something that's per month, week, etc.

135
00:18:07,860 --> 00:18:14,730
It can vary from minus infinity to infinity, although you don't normally see numbers that large rate,

136
00:18:15,480 --> 00:18:20,580
it can be reasonably large, but in theory, I guess it could go up to infinity.

137
00:18:22,950 --> 00:18:26,759
All right. So what mortality rate, difference rate? We've had that mortality rate we talked about.

138
00:18:26,760 --> 00:18:36,120
So the mortality rate in one group minus the mortality rates in another group also called the mortality density difference in in some tracks.

139
00:18:38,670 --> 00:18:42,250
Think how Morganstern like in his notes.

140
00:18:42,270 --> 00:18:46,050
I think it might be called the mortality density difference that.

141
00:18:47,640 --> 00:18:53,490
So I took this course over from somebody who taught this course for like I know, at least 20 years.

142
00:18:53,910 --> 00:18:58,260
And so all the students in AP at least still passed down Hal's notes,

143
00:18:58,260 --> 00:19:06,690
which when he told the class there were like no slides or anything, he kind of sit in the corner and just go over his notes.

144
00:19:06,690 --> 00:19:09,510
And he provided you like a copy of the notes.

145
00:19:11,310 --> 00:19:19,740
They're quite good, but they can be a little bit dense, I would say, to get through at times or problems,

146
00:19:19,740 --> 00:19:23,729
difference the problems in one group and a problem in another group.

147
00:19:23,730 --> 00:19:28,890
This one's going to be dimensionless range from -1 to 1.

148
00:19:31,470 --> 00:19:34,140
All right. So a summary of our difference measures.

149
00:19:34,140 --> 00:19:40,710
We have our risk difference risk in one group minus risk in another group, we have our incidence density difference.

150
00:19:41,310 --> 00:19:45,390
The incidence density in one group minus the incidence density in another group.

151
00:19:45,930 --> 00:19:53,190
Um, mortality rate difference. Thank you for risk tolerance.

152
00:19:53,190 --> 00:19:56,400
Maybe I should have done sea air, sea air minus sea air.

153
00:19:56,520 --> 00:20:03,600
It's not always the rate. That rate for the top one. Mortality rate difference mortality rate one minus the mortality rate in another.

154
00:20:04,110 --> 00:20:08,780
And the prevalence difference is the prevalence. And one group known as the prevalence, not a group.

155
00:20:10,890 --> 00:20:11,220
All right.

156
00:20:11,730 --> 00:20:21,180
So our relationship between a difference measure and a ratio measure you can use have the right ratio measure to calculate the difference measure.

157
00:20:21,540 --> 00:20:30,809
So here, write our risk ratio for rate ratio is equal to the rate one room divided by the rate in the other group.

158
00:20:30,810 --> 00:20:40,190
Right. So for the risk differences, we're subtracting your risk for this experiment.

159
00:20:41,610 --> 00:20:47,060
Please. The batteries in this. Thank you.

160
00:20:47,480 --> 00:20:55,340
All right. And we will use a laser pointer for the moment.

161
00:20:55,490 --> 00:21:04,370
Okay. Okay. Don't like as much. So here all we've done is we solve for the risk in the exposed grid.

162
00:21:05,060 --> 00:21:09,889
Right. And so you're going to multiply by the risk in the unexposed group on this side.

163
00:21:09,890 --> 00:21:12,709
You multiply by the risk of the unexposed group on this side.

164
00:21:12,710 --> 00:21:24,200
And we get the risk in the exposed group is equal to the relative risk, minus three times the risk in the unexposed group.

165
00:21:24,770 --> 00:21:27,350
Right. So we're going to substitute that into the equation.

166
00:21:27,650 --> 00:21:36,170
We end up with the relative risk times the risk in the unexposed group minus the risk of the unexposed group.

167
00:21:36,170 --> 00:21:43,820
Right. So the source of that data, we end up with the risk in the unexposed group times the relative risk minus one.

168
00:21:44,090 --> 00:21:49,760
That's what the risk differences equal to. So that's an alternative formula for you to use for risk.

169
00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:53,690
Difference on surface difference is going to be directly proportional to both

170
00:21:53,690 --> 00:21:58,310
the relative risk and to the risk of disease in the unexposed population.

171
00:21:59,630 --> 00:22:02,780
And me to chase Katie off. Maybe the exit didn't fix it.

172
00:22:03,230 --> 00:22:07,970
All right. So attributable risk here.

173
00:22:08,990 --> 00:22:10,219
This was from Gore-Tex.

174
00:22:10,220 --> 00:22:20,570
I guess one of nice figures is also it's also got excess fraction attributable number and can incorrectly be called the ideologic fraction.

175
00:22:21,470 --> 00:22:27,410
It's called excess risk and the attributable fraction.

176
00:22:27,410 --> 00:22:34,460
Right. So X extraction attributable fraction attributable number X and excess risk.

177
00:22:34,910 --> 00:22:40,490
Incorrect. You call it etiologic fraction. I would call it attributable risk.

178
00:22:41,660 --> 00:22:49,340
Right. But you will see it called all of those things in the literature if you read

179
00:22:49,340 --> 00:22:53,780
enough papers and and you will see all different things in different textbooks.

180
00:22:54,470 --> 00:22:59,270
All right. So basically, it's this idea that we're going to subtract out the background risk.

181
00:22:59,270 --> 00:23:05,540
So here we have the risk in the exposed group. Here we have the risk in the unexposed group.

182
00:23:05,840 --> 00:23:13,790
And if you draw a little dash line across, right, you can kind of take away the kind of background risk that's that is present.

183
00:23:14,630 --> 00:23:22,160
And you get this risk in the exposed group or the incidence that we're seeing is actually due to the exposure, right?

184
00:23:22,160 --> 00:23:26,960
Where there's some incidence in the exposed group that really isn't due to the exposure because if you could take it away,

185
00:23:27,350 --> 00:23:30,409
they would still get the disease of interest.

186
00:23:30,410 --> 00:23:36,450
Just the idea of. Right. And we'll talk a little bit more about that actually later we're going to talk

187
00:23:36,470 --> 00:23:41,930
go back into causal states and compare relative measures and absolute measures.

188
00:23:42,590 --> 00:23:50,790
All right. So attributable risk, the risk in one group minus the risk in another looks exactly like the equation.

189
00:23:50,790 --> 00:23:57,379
Right. For the risk difference, the right can either be in the risk or here.

190
00:23:57,380 --> 00:23:59,570
So I can either be a rate or a risk.

191
00:24:02,780 --> 00:24:08,660
So since incidence has to be calculated, you cannot normally calculated attributable risk from case control studies.

192
00:24:09,620 --> 00:24:18,200
However, there are situations under which you can look over that odd dimensions or lack thereof are going to be determined by the measure used.

193
00:24:18,890 --> 00:24:24,620
Right. And the range is determined by the disease measure use.

194
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:36,200
So this could either be using a risk rate or a rate. So here's an example bacteria, urea and oral contraceptive use.

195
00:24:37,850 --> 00:24:46,219
So we're going to do the attributable risk rate, which is the risk in the exposed group, minus the risk in the unexposed group.

196
00:24:46,220 --> 00:24:49,790
So can you calculate that the attributable risk per 100,000 women.

197
00:25:44,090 --> 00:25:47,510
Oh. Oh, it's lovely. Thank you.

198
00:25:49,940 --> 00:25:57,230
All right. Okay. So we calculate that at 27 divided by 42.

199
00:25:57,590 --> 00:26:05,480
All right. So it's the experts cases divided by the total exposed population.

200
00:26:05,870 --> 00:26:11,210
Right. And then 77, which is the unexposed case, is divided by 19 ways.

201
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:18,060
All right. We get 0.01566.

202
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:23,400
So 1566 cases per 100,000 women.

203
00:26:25,140 --> 00:26:35,930
So when we interpret that will say among every 100,000 oral contraceptive users, there are 1566 excess cases of that territory in.

204
00:26:42,550 --> 00:26:45,580
All right. So what do you quickly calculate out the attributable risk?

205
00:26:45,880 --> 00:26:49,060
Ignore this attributable risk percent. We'll do that in a moment.

206
00:27:34,030 --> 00:27:43,700
I'm sorry. In the literature that you have that you don't see it that much in the literature.

207
00:27:49,880 --> 00:27:53,150
So yeah, you often see the attributable risk.

208
00:27:53,180 --> 00:28:01,860
You see it more in policy documents. You'll see a lot there when people start to think about like, what about if we remove this exposure?

209
00:28:02,200 --> 00:28:05,830
But but it is like this is among the exposed population.

210
00:28:06,190 --> 00:28:09,580
Right. And we often think about it almost the entire population.

211
00:28:10,600 --> 00:28:16,479
It makes sense. But you will still see it in more kind of policy.

212
00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:21,850
What if we enact this intervention, particularly if we enact interventions among really high risk groups?

213
00:28:21,860 --> 00:28:24,940
Right. Like that's what we tend to still see a lot of attributable risk.

214
00:28:25,270 --> 00:28:29,169
We have definitely not as common what you'll see a lot now as people doing risk

215
00:28:29,170 --> 00:28:34,270
differences or you'll see them do both the relative measure and of this difference.

216
00:28:41,890 --> 00:28:51,140
So here we're going to start off by calculating the cumulative incidence in the borough exposed and unexposed.

217
00:28:51,140 --> 00:28:54,160
So one of the things we have to be able to do here is let's figure out what measure.

218
00:28:54,790 --> 00:28:56,110
Right you're going to be calculating.

219
00:29:01,390 --> 00:29:07,240
Attributable risk is going to be the cumulative incidents and the exposed minus the cumulative two incidents in the unexposed, right?

220
00:29:07,240 --> 00:29:14,860
So we get 28.0 -17.4 or 10.6 cases per 1000 persons.

221
00:29:21,860 --> 00:29:28,910
Okay. So for attributable risk in case control studies, generally, you cannot estimate incidence in a case control study.

222
00:29:31,120 --> 00:29:36,730
Just for the record, sometimes you'll see in the literature the excess fractions or the triple fractions.

223
00:29:37,120 --> 00:29:40,370
So it's like if you don't see a trouble with the air.

224
00:29:40,470 --> 00:29:44,630
Actually, I do sometimes. Like all of those fractions. Yeah.

225
00:29:44,690 --> 00:29:51,220
Going over the different while you were at the different games for it. But yeah you do, you do see like what I think the thing is, is like.

226
00:29:54,740 --> 00:30:01,170
Causality for some time. That's the ideological fraction in a way, right?

227
00:30:01,180 --> 00:30:09,310
That actually because we extract the fraction, you're still subtracting out people that were,

228
00:30:10,270 --> 00:30:13,599
you know, potential and actually caused by it because of the background risk rate.

229
00:30:13,600 --> 00:30:19,890
So. So for so.

230
00:30:21,630 --> 00:30:25,410
There's no difference in calculation between that and this difference.

231
00:30:26,250 --> 00:30:31,250
No, absolutely no difference. No, it's basically the same thing.

232
00:30:31,260 --> 00:30:34,499
Right. And so by a different name. Right.

233
00:30:34,500 --> 00:30:37,730
Except here attributable risk. You could also use it a rate measure. Right.

234
00:30:37,740 --> 00:30:44,870
So it's kind of a summary word for a risk difference or a rate difference.

235
00:30:47,590 --> 00:30:51,920
Yeah. All right.

236
00:30:53,480 --> 00:30:57,380
So case control studies generally, we can't calculate this in a case control study,

237
00:30:57,590 --> 00:31:01,790
and that's because we generally cannot estimate incidents in a case control study.

238
00:31:02,630 --> 00:31:04,760
Therefore, you cannot estimate attributable risk.

239
00:31:05,660 --> 00:31:12,080
So if you get asked to estimate attributable risk on a case control study and are not giving certain key pieces of data,

240
00:31:12,080 --> 00:31:15,229
you would say you cannot estimate that from this type of study.

241
00:31:15,230 --> 00:31:22,250
Right. But if you do know the incidence rate in the population and you assume that the

242
00:31:22,250 --> 00:31:27,470
exposure level in the controls is representative of the general population,

243
00:31:28,190 --> 00:31:33,980
then you can calculate the attributable risk. And so why is that?

244
00:31:34,250 --> 00:31:37,940
So we've got the incidence in the total population, so we have to get that from another source.

245
00:31:37,950 --> 00:31:40,099
Right. You're not going to get that from your case.

246
00:31:40,100 --> 00:31:45,380
Control study is a weighted average of the incidence rate among the exposed in the unexposed right.

247
00:31:45,770 --> 00:31:48,049
So it's basically the instruments and the exposure times,

248
00:31:48,050 --> 00:31:54,640
the proportion of people who were exposed plus the incidence in the unexposed times, the proportion of people who are unexposed.

249
00:31:54,650 --> 00:32:00,890
Right. And that's how we get our total incidence in the population. Our.

250
00:32:06,100 --> 00:32:12,130
Risk ratio is the incidence in the exposed divided by the incidence in the unexposed.

251
00:32:12,730 --> 00:32:15,360
If we can do that same kind of math trick, right.

252
00:32:15,370 --> 00:32:25,750
So therefore the incidence in the exposed was the odds ratio, which was something in our times, the incidence in the unexposed.

253
00:32:26,160 --> 00:32:31,299
And put that back into incidence in the total population here and we get the incidence in

254
00:32:31,300 --> 00:32:37,360
the total population is equal to the odds ratio times the incidents in the unexposed times,

255
00:32:37,420 --> 00:32:46,989
the prevalence of the exposure plus the incidence in the unexposed times, the prevalence of the unexposed.

256
00:32:46,990 --> 00:32:53,260
And, and we're using our key, our control series for those proportions in this example.

257
00:32:53,470 --> 00:32:57,250
So then you can solve for the incidence in the unexposed right.

258
00:32:57,940 --> 00:33:03,070
And if you can get that, then you can actually calculate out the attributable risk.

259
00:33:05,140 --> 00:33:09,010
Don't worry, we'll get to do this in just a second. Rates are getting to the get an example of that.

260
00:33:09,010 --> 00:33:14,170
So here we go. We're going to go back to our Dolan Hill case control study.

261
00:33:14,860 --> 00:33:19,870
But the additional piece of information you need to do this, of course, is what was the incidence in the total population?

262
00:33:20,530 --> 00:33:24,490
So we're using 400 cases per million persons per year.

263
00:33:25,600 --> 00:33:29,500
So we've got our odds ratio already from before, right, that 9.1.

264
00:33:30,490 --> 00:33:34,630
And so we will use this formula here.

265
00:33:35,380 --> 00:33:38,470
So here's our incidence in the total population.

266
00:33:38,470 --> 00:33:46,480
We that 400 divided by ten to the six divided by 9.1 times three.

267
00:33:51,760 --> 00:33:55,190
It's still kind of acting punk here. I think it's a anyways.

268
00:33:55,400 --> 00:34:05,270
Okay. So times are 12.6, 1296 divided by 1357 plus 61 divided by 1357.

269
00:34:05,270 --> 00:34:11,749
Right. This is coming only out of your control series. So like our total number of controls is 1357, right?

270
00:34:11,750 --> 00:34:24,890
So that 1296 is the number of smokers in our control series divided by 1357 plus 61, which is the number of nonsmokers in our control series.

271
00:34:27,050 --> 00:34:31,730
All right. So we get the incidents in the unexposed. So for the incidence of exposures,

272
00:34:31,730 --> 00:34:46,060
we can solve for that by doing the odds ratio times the incidence in the unexposed and we get 4.16 at 416.7 per million persons.

273
00:34:46,550 --> 00:34:52,850
Right. So the attributable risk is going to be the incidence and the exposures minus the incidence in the unexposed.

274
00:34:53,240 --> 00:34:57,020
So 416.7 -45.8.

275
00:34:57,560 --> 00:35:02,510
Right. And we end up with 370.9.

276
00:35:04,550 --> 00:35:08,510
So make sure that you going to pay attention to the fact that for those proportions we're only

277
00:35:08,510 --> 00:35:15,860
using the control information because of course we expect for something to risk factor for that.

278
00:35:15,860 --> 00:35:24,530
The prevalence of that exposure to be enhanced, you know, increased in our in our disease population.

279
00:35:24,860 --> 00:35:33,320
So then we'd say among every 1 million smokers, there are 370.9 excess cases of lung cancer due to smoking each year.

280
00:35:37,370 --> 00:35:46,240
So I'm a no go then. So 370 out of the 400, our duties are due to smoking.

281
00:35:46,280 --> 00:35:50,180
We're kind of saying like if we can completely eliminate smoking, you know,

282
00:35:50,780 --> 00:35:55,880
among the the exposed population, that is how many cases we would be preventing.

283
00:36:00,250 --> 00:36:08,649
Per million persons per year. Um, attributable risk really reflects the extent to which causal type two individuals remember

284
00:36:08,650 --> 00:36:14,060
those are affect positive outnumber causal type three individuals or effect preventative.

285
00:36:15,490 --> 00:36:20,770
Thus it would be zero if equal numbers of these two causal types are exposed.

286
00:36:21,190 --> 00:36:21,399
Right.

287
00:36:21,400 --> 00:36:31,870
So even in that case, the exposure would not be a risk factor in the population, even though it was a cause in some individuals in the population.

288
00:36:35,720 --> 00:36:38,900
It's a fairly theoretical point there.

289
00:36:38,900 --> 00:36:42,530
Right, but just something to remember.

290
00:36:44,630 --> 00:36:50,420
So attributable risk percent, it's also called the attributable fraction in the exposed.

291
00:36:51,260 --> 00:36:54,830
Although when you call it that, it's a fraction, you know, multiply by 100.

292
00:36:55,280 --> 00:37:03,950
Right. So attributable risk percent is the higher the risk in the exposures minus the risk in the unexposed.

293
00:37:03,950 --> 00:37:11,330
But it adheres to exposed times 100%. This is used when the relative risk is greater than one.

294
00:37:11,960 --> 00:37:12,250
Right.

295
00:37:12,260 --> 00:37:19,700
So we'd say among the cases in the exposed group, what we're saying is among the cases in the exposed group, what proportion are due to the exposure?

296
00:37:22,130 --> 00:37:30,040
Already said this also called attributable fraction answers the public health question What percentage of disease in the exposed group can we help?

297
00:37:30,180 --> 00:37:34,610
Oh, to prevent, we were able to eliminate exposure to the agent in question.

298
00:37:36,680 --> 00:37:42,860
It could also be calculated as the attributable risk divided by the risk in the exposed group.

299
00:37:44,570 --> 00:37:55,010
And you can substitute in the R offer the or, you know, if we think it's kind of a reasonable estimate of the relative risk.

300
00:37:57,950 --> 00:38:01,160
All right. So for bacterial and O.C. use.

301
00:38:01,760 --> 00:38:09,680
Right. You're going to go from this table. So the risk in the exposed group minus the risk in the unexposed divided by the risk in close friends.

302
00:38:09,680 --> 00:38:13,490
100% predictable risk because we already calculated that.

303
00:38:13,500 --> 00:38:19,130
Right. So you want to use that divided by the risk of exposure planes 100.

304
00:38:20,090 --> 00:38:24,500
So there is our attributable risk from earlier.

305
00:38:24,890 --> 00:38:28,430
Okay. We're going to divide by 27 divided by 42.

306
00:38:28,430 --> 00:38:38,000
That's the risk in the exposed group. Multiply it by 100 and you get 27.96%.

307
00:38:44,940 --> 00:38:53,550
So then we'd say among oral contraceptive users, 27.96% of bacteria is due to oral contraceptive use,

308
00:38:53,820 --> 00:39:00,090
although here this is due to is, you know, assuming this is this is causal, right?

309
00:39:05,320 --> 00:39:09,070
All right. So for the island health, right.

310
00:39:09,070 --> 00:39:16,500
We can do this with bananas ratio as well. So we get the odds ratio was 9.1, right?

311
00:39:16,500 --> 00:39:24,800
So 9.1 minus one divided by 9.1 times 100%, and we end up with 89%.

312
00:39:24,810 --> 00:39:29,420
So 89% of lung cancer cases among smokers are due to smoking.

313
00:39:29,420 --> 00:39:33,950
Once again, that is a causal interpretation of that.

314
00:39:35,480 --> 00:39:43,310
And although I feel fairly certain smoking causes lung cancer, so we're pretty comfortable with with making that statement.

315
00:39:44,150 --> 00:39:47,930
All right. So here we're going to go back to our cohort example.

316
00:39:48,200 --> 00:39:51,200
Can you go ahead and calculate the attributable risk percent?

317
00:41:10,020 --> 00:41:21,209
All right. So we have our rates from before rate 28.0 cases per 1000 persons 17.4 cases per thousand persons attributable risk percentage.

318
00:41:21,210 --> 00:41:26,430
We can also use our attributable risk from before but divided by the risk in the exposed.

319
00:41:27,300 --> 00:41:36,870
So we get that 10.6 that you already calculated divided by 28.0 times 100% equals 37.9%.

320
00:41:43,320 --> 00:41:50,370
All right. So prevented fraction. When your relative risk is less than one, you're going to talk about the prevention fraction percent.

321
00:41:50,710 --> 00:41:54,420
So prevent a fraction percent. We're just swapping those around a little bit.

322
00:41:54,420 --> 00:42:04,860
Right. So what's the risk in the unexposed minus the risk in the exposed divided by the risk in the unexposed in this particular case times 100%.

323
00:42:05,430 --> 00:42:12,840
The alternative formula is one minus the relative risk, at times 100%.

324
00:42:13,740 --> 00:42:16,770
You might, but some of you may recognize that formula.

325
00:42:16,770 --> 00:42:24,750
But maybe not. You need to do kind of more intervention or vaccine work.

326
00:42:25,320 --> 00:42:33,610
That's the formula for efficacy, right? So efficacy is the risk in the control group minus the risk in the intervention group,

327
00:42:33,610 --> 00:42:40,020
because we're now the intervention group has a lower risk rate divided by the risk in the control group times 100%.

328
00:42:40,650 --> 00:42:44,730
So that's the relative risk minus one divided by the relative risk 100%.

329
00:42:45,210 --> 00:42:53,340
Right. Or if you're flipping your relative risk around, it would be one minus the relative risk times 100%.

330
00:42:53,370 --> 00:42:58,650
So just make sure you pay attention to how you're setting that up by determining which formula you're going to use.

331
00:42:59,880 --> 00:43:07,620
So with that, it is 1047. We are going to take a look at the activity.

332
00:43:12,620 --> 00:43:16,770
A slightly longer break to give you both a break and time to work on the activity.

333
00:43:25,450 --> 00:43:29,069
Okay. Yeah, they can do. Okay. You know what?

334
00:43:29,070 --> 00:43:37,500
We're going to take a. At least 25 minute break, and then I'm going to see how or at least 20 minute to say at least 20 minute break.

335
00:43:38,610 --> 00:43:45,209
So starting back up at ten after the hour and we will see how people are doing at that point

336
00:43:45,210 --> 00:43:49,020
because it may take you a little bit longer to get through this through this activity.

337
00:44:00,004 --> 00:44:06,754
Okay, I'm recording. All right. So before we get started back up with population attributable risk,

338
00:44:07,054 --> 00:44:12,184
one thing we just looked have a few questions, and I like to just give information to one person if I can help.

339
00:44:12,184 --> 00:44:17,914
But I'm getting some questions about about the exam, which is coming up October six.

340
00:44:18,364 --> 00:44:24,994
It is in person. It is not open book or open notes.

341
00:44:25,954 --> 00:44:30,994
And in fact, you do need to memorize some formulas, as I said, on the first day for the exams.

342
00:44:31,804 --> 00:44:39,244
So in the interest of everybody getting ready for that, we're going to be releasing both the full formula sheet for this module,

343
00:44:39,244 --> 00:44:43,804
as well as the formula, the version of it that you will be provided on the exam.

344
00:44:44,464 --> 00:44:47,014
All right. And you will notice that there are certain formulas missing.

345
00:44:47,734 --> 00:44:53,594
And I believe the actual formula sheet really has indicated which ones you need to memorize on it as well.

346
00:44:56,074 --> 00:45:00,664
So so that will be out there, you know, for your study purposes.

347
00:45:00,664 --> 00:45:08,104
And so you don't have any surprises at the last minute about exactly what it is we want you to know kind of immediately.

348
00:45:09,244 --> 00:45:16,053
The other thing is I always debate this. People shouldn't ask, what does the exam look like if we have a practice exam?

349
00:45:16,054 --> 00:45:19,954
It's an old version. There may be some confidence interval calculation, which I'm going to tell you right now.

350
00:45:20,254 --> 00:45:27,934
We will make you do on this exam. I think we're going to go ahead and release that in the next few days.

351
00:45:27,964 --> 00:45:35,554
However, my advice to everybody is to wait to to do the problems on that exam.

352
00:45:36,034 --> 00:45:43,204
All right. Wait until you are about you think you're about ready to take the exam in class at least a few days beforehand?

353
00:45:43,954 --> 00:45:55,294
Sit down like you're taking an in-class exam, put away your notes, have the calculator you're going to use on the exam day and time yourself.

354
00:45:55,864 --> 00:45:59,133
Going through this exam, I will say that that which may be slightly longer,

355
00:45:59,134 --> 00:46:04,564
but particularly if you do the confidence interval calculations than the one you have in class.

356
00:46:05,044 --> 00:46:10,744
Right. But if you get 2 hours into time and you're halfway through the exam,

357
00:46:11,584 --> 00:46:15,123
you know that you need to do a bit more studying, right, to kind of speed up things.

358
00:46:15,124 --> 00:46:19,884
You can just go ahead and continue to finish it. It also helps you just kind of focus in on a little bit on well,

359
00:46:19,984 --> 00:46:23,954
there there are some things that I it takes me a little bit more time to think about or

360
00:46:23,954 --> 00:46:29,134
I struggle with a little bit more and a good test taking strategy for stuff like that.

361
00:46:29,384 --> 00:46:33,394
Wanting to skip that question. Right. Move on. Go through the rest of the exam.

362
00:46:33,394 --> 00:46:37,594
Come back to it at the end for various reasons builds confidence.

363
00:46:37,774 --> 00:46:47,494
And if you run short on time, then you know you've used your time the most efficient way you could finish change, essentially.

364
00:46:48,424 --> 00:46:53,974
So there you go. So we will get that out.

365
00:46:54,064 --> 00:46:57,963
We're just going to look over it one more time. I mean, it's like that version 17.

366
00:46:57,964 --> 00:47:03,604
So I cannot imagine we will find any other issues with it at this point, but we're going to look at it one more time,

367
00:47:03,604 --> 00:47:10,753
make sure it's a good example for us to be practicing on and just make sure there's not too much confidence interval stuff that that I think it would

368
00:47:10,754 --> 00:47:19,114
like throw it off in the length of I expect this exam to be exams I admit to be a really long and I learned over time to kind of pare them back a bit.

369
00:47:19,114 --> 00:47:25,884
Right, so that they're there, you know, making sure that it's it's not just like how fast can you do this, you know,

370
00:47:25,894 --> 00:47:32,614
to get to to do well exam so they can still be a bit long for people though so so practicing that time

371
00:47:32,614 --> 00:47:37,924
figuring out what it is you might struggle with a little bit more and spending a bit more time on that,

372
00:47:38,074 --> 00:47:41,914
you know, sort of makes sense. So the exam will be out there. The solution will be out there.

373
00:47:41,914 --> 00:47:44,344
I would wait until the end.

374
00:47:44,344 --> 00:47:52,213
We do have a review session at the end so we don't like have a lecture one day testing all the material one two days later.

375
00:47:52,214 --> 00:48:01,594
Right. Like I don't like to do that either, so it's not really fair or so and we will have extra office hours right around exam time

376
00:48:01,594 --> 00:48:05,014
because that tends to be the time that people really realize what they're not getting.

377
00:48:05,014 --> 00:48:11,464
But I would encourage you, Katie's got regular office hours set up, so I would encourage you, as you're going through this,

378
00:48:11,704 --> 00:48:20,463
to utilize those office hours for anything rather than waiting till right before kind of exam time or after exam time.

379
00:48:20,464 --> 00:48:26,104
Sometimes people come to office hours after exam from the exams because this material for module one,

380
00:48:26,104 --> 00:48:30,034
you basically need to know a majority of this material for all of the rest of the class.

381
00:48:30,574 --> 00:48:40,653
Right. All right. So population attributable risk is the attributable risk for an entire population.

382
00:48:40,654 --> 00:48:43,984
So now we're not looking at just the exposed group. Right, looking at everybody.

383
00:48:45,114 --> 00:48:49,874
So for the amount of disease. In the population that can be attributed to a particular factor.

384
00:48:50,324 --> 00:48:53,383
The population attributable risk is going to be the total risk,

385
00:48:53,384 --> 00:48:59,774
minus the risk of the unexposed group or the attributable risk times the proportion exposed.

386
00:49:02,114 --> 00:49:05,954
It's going to answer the public health question How many cases of disease in the total

387
00:49:05,954 --> 00:49:13,004
population can we hope to prevent if we are able to eliminate exposure to the agent in question?

388
00:49:13,574 --> 00:49:16,904
So one thing to notice here, I'm going to take up from the next slide.

389
00:49:17,174 --> 00:49:26,714
Right? It's the attributable risk, time of proportion exposed. So the highest the population typical risk could be would be what in the formula.

390
00:49:32,184 --> 00:49:37,584
It would be the attributable real strength of the highest it could be, as I said, a proportion of what everybody's exposed.

391
00:49:38,034 --> 00:49:42,954
Right. So when you're looking at this, if you calculate these measures, the population triple.

392
00:49:42,954 --> 00:49:46,794
The risk is higher than your typical risk. Something has gone wrong, right?

393
00:49:46,974 --> 00:49:54,384
You might have flipped them around and just remembered, you know, what you're looking at.

394
00:49:54,654 --> 00:50:02,904
Or you might be actually incorrectly kind of identifying what measure you ought to be using in that situation or sometimes also.

395
00:50:04,494 --> 00:50:08,604
Okay. So the population attributable risk is never going to be larger than the attributable risk.

396
00:50:08,604 --> 00:50:13,944
Right. And that's because it's the attributable risk types, the proportion that that are exposed,

397
00:50:14,274 --> 00:50:21,984
which at most can be one of the dimensions or the lack thereof are determined by the type of incidence measure used.

398
00:50:23,394 --> 00:50:28,674
If the exposure is causal or is believed to be causal, you feel pretty good about that.

399
00:50:29,304 --> 00:50:34,614
Then the population attributable risk is a measure of the impact of the exposure on the population's health.

400
00:50:36,954 --> 00:50:40,823
So we're going to go back to our same example bacteria area, right?

401
00:50:40,824 --> 00:50:47,544
The population attributable risk is going to be the risk in the total population minus the risk in the unexposed.

402
00:50:48,534 --> 00:50:53,544
So here what we've done but 1 to 4.

403
00:50:53,634 --> 00:50:58,284
So that's the total number of cases divided by the total population, right?

404
00:50:58,284 --> 00:51:05,393
That's going to be our risk in the total population -77 divided by 19 of oh eight.

405
00:51:05,394 --> 00:51:18,144
Right. So the risk of the total population minus the risk in the unexposed, we end up with 0.00316, which is 316 cases per 100,000 women per year.

406
00:51:20,994 --> 00:51:28,484
So if you're interpreting this as causal sorry, I'm not sure it's never been identified.

407
00:51:29,124 --> 00:51:35,304
No, attributable risk isn't going to be negative. But you you can get the preventive fraction right.

408
00:51:35,304 --> 00:51:39,383
So and it is only you will see it negative.

409
00:51:39,384 --> 00:51:43,654
But yeah, it's negative. Yeah.

410
00:51:44,974 --> 00:51:51,304
So you can just switch around your exposure in that case. All right.

411
00:51:51,994 --> 00:52:00,123
So interpretation, assuming it's causal. There are 316 excess excess cases of bacteria per year in a population of 100,000

412
00:52:00,124 --> 00:52:07,324
women that are due to the type due to their let's make that is making it causal.

413
00:52:07,324 --> 00:52:11,354
We can also say that are associated with oral contraceptive use that is not assuming

414
00:52:11,354 --> 00:52:17,344
the causal relationship right so far as right there due to oral contraceptive use.

415
00:52:19,654 --> 00:52:23,074
All right. So with the population attributable risk, right,

416
00:52:23,284 --> 00:52:28,744
you can actually do the population attributable risk for a number of risk factors that people often don't have one.

417
00:52:30,064 --> 00:52:34,623
It's going to be usually going to be lower than the some of the population attributable risks.

418
00:52:34,624 --> 00:52:39,814
We're not just adding them together since a case can be attributed to more than one risk factor.

419
00:52:39,814 --> 00:52:42,144
Right. In fact, you're quite right.

420
00:52:44,434 --> 00:52:57,303
So our combined p r is one minus one minus the PR for your first factor times one minus the PR for your second factor times one minus the PR.

421
00:52:57,304 --> 00:53:01,114
For your third factor you're looking at, you know, and it goes on from there.

422
00:53:02,344 --> 00:53:07,494
This does assume no multiplicative interaction which will get into a marginal shape.

423
00:53:12,974 --> 00:53:19,824
So etiologic fractions versus excessive fractions. The etiologic fraction is the proportion of cases in the blood,

424
00:53:19,904 --> 00:53:25,604
in the exposed population in which the exposure played a causal role in disease development.

425
00:53:26,684 --> 00:53:28,513
The excess fraction, on the other hand,

426
00:53:28,514 --> 00:53:37,454
is the proportion of cases occurring during a time period among the exposed population that is in excess to the unexposed population.

427
00:53:38,654 --> 00:53:42,704
All excess cases are going to be etiologic cases.

428
00:53:43,664 --> 00:53:49,454
But the inverse is not necessarily true. Not all etiologic cases are going to be access cases.

429
00:53:51,824 --> 00:53:55,154
PR is going to be the measure of excess cases.

430
00:53:56,504 --> 00:53:59,994
So an example to kind of explain that comes from Greenland and Robins.

431
00:54:00,274 --> 00:54:06,224
So a study of leukemia among soldiers in the 20 years after they were exposed to radiation from a nuclear bomb test.

432
00:54:07,274 --> 00:54:12,583
There might be calls, there may be cases caused by radiation that even if they were not exposed,

433
00:54:12,584 --> 00:54:15,824
would have gotten leukemia anyways during that 20 years. Right.

434
00:54:16,064 --> 00:54:19,244
But you're still kind of counting them in those numbers.

435
00:54:20,574 --> 00:54:29,734
All right. So population attributable risk percent or percent is the attributable risk for the entire population.

436
00:54:31,124 --> 00:54:35,894
Right. So. Yes.

437
00:54:36,364 --> 00:54:42,043
All access does it all. No,

438
00:54:42,044 --> 00:54:45,314
because there can be immunologic pieces that are actually not being counted

439
00:54:45,314 --> 00:54:51,634
and because you because you also have to think that it's a more minor point,

440
00:54:51,644 --> 00:55:01,334
I would say, that might go through your coffee or your table here and figure out who's being helped in certain scenarios,

441
00:55:01,724 --> 00:55:07,724
because it basically comes down to three people who are kind of messing it up.

442
00:55:09,134 --> 00:55:18,254
Some of your cases are not being counted in your access patients with other people for whom the exposure is actually.

443
00:55:21,564 --> 00:55:27,114
But it is more minor. I would actually touch you on that.

444
00:55:31,894 --> 00:55:37,774
And how Morgan Stanley's notes go into that in detail.

445
00:55:38,704 --> 00:55:42,984
If you want to visit the find them index.

446
00:55:43,274 --> 00:55:47,224
That's the one trick is finding where stuff is. Yeah. All right.

447
00:55:47,734 --> 00:55:50,824
So here we go. Population attributable risk percent.

448
00:55:52,024 --> 00:55:57,873
It's going to be attributable. Risk for the entire population of our percent is the risk from the total population,

449
00:55:57,874 --> 00:56:01,804
minus the risk for the unexposed divided by the risk in the total population.

450
00:56:02,044 --> 00:56:09,574
Times 100% answers to the public health question What percentage of the disease in the population can we hope to

451
00:56:09,574 --> 00:56:16,864
prevent if we are able to eliminate the exposure to the agent in question to whatever exposure we'd like to get rid of?

452
00:56:17,434 --> 00:56:22,413
Theoretically, there is an alternative formula for population attributable risk.

453
00:56:22,414 --> 00:56:35,014
Percent is the proportion of exposed times, the relative risk minus one over the proportion exposed times, the relative risk minus one +21 times 100%.

454
00:56:36,694 --> 00:56:38,564
So p one who was there for exposure.

455
00:56:38,584 --> 00:56:47,913
Prevalence of the exposure can't be used in the place or can be used in the place of or if the proportion exposed is

456
00:56:47,914 --> 00:56:55,444
either known for the general population or if the controls we assume are a good representation of the general population.

457
00:56:55,744 --> 00:57:02,764
I will say here, if you go back and think about the Dolan Hill study, I have debated for a long time like taking that out of this lecture,

458
00:57:03,574 --> 00:57:10,864
but I really like to bring in some really big historical AP study is right, and that was like a really famous case control study.

459
00:57:11,944 --> 00:57:18,903
But if you go back and look at that, the there's no reason in the world and we'll talk about it later to believe that the controls

460
00:57:18,904 --> 00:57:25,053
could possibly or would likely anyways be actually representative of the general population.

461
00:57:25,054 --> 00:57:29,914
And let's suppose the prevalence of smoking in those controls is just incredibly high.

462
00:57:30,914 --> 00:57:42,094
I just wanted to acknowledge that anyways because we do assume that a few times here which which in fact we do not believe to be true.

463
00:57:43,264 --> 00:57:47,673
All right. So population attributable risk percent. Here we have an example.

464
00:57:47,674 --> 00:57:55,954
Scientists have identified a gene variant that they estimate confers a 21% population attributable risk for type two diabetes.

465
00:58:00,734 --> 00:58:03,794
So population attributable risk percent.

466
00:58:03,974 --> 00:58:16,004
We're going to go back to that same example we've used a few times now before risk in the total minus the risk in the unexposed in the total top 10%.

467
00:58:16,004 --> 00:58:22,994
Or we can do or are divided by the risk in the total since we've already populated are that's going to be a little bit faster for us.

468
00:58:25,364 --> 00:58:34,093
Right. So we use our R from four divided by 1 to 4, which is the total number of cases divided by the total population.

469
00:58:34,094 --> 00:58:37,994
Right. That's the version of the total population times 100%.

470
00:58:38,654 --> 00:58:48,704
And we end up with 7.3% and we do a little mental check to make sure it is less than the attributable risk percent.

471
00:58:48,974 --> 00:58:54,404
Okay, that's exactly that makes sense. All right. So why why don't we have any units here?

472
00:59:02,324 --> 00:59:07,514
The math reason write these are going to have the same units in this case and hence, while we don't know units.

473
00:59:09,884 --> 00:59:15,374
All right. So let's go back to that mistake on the slide.

474
00:59:15,824 --> 00:59:20,114
That example should say P, R and R and R percent.

475
00:59:21,404 --> 00:59:24,883
If you can make that actual change in the slides and we'll put that up there.

476
00:59:24,884 --> 01:02:26,604
But anyways, R and R percent. All right.

477
01:02:28,554 --> 01:02:33,954
So in the unexposed where we got the risk in the unexposed which was 87 divided by 5000.

478
01:02:34,674 --> 01:02:46,704
Right because our non smokers so we get 17.71 cases per 1000 persons and then in the total population 171 divided by 8000.

479
01:02:47,664 --> 01:02:51,234
So 21.4 cases per 1000 persons.

480
01:02:52,824 --> 01:02:58,104
So the PR is going to be the risk in the total population, minus the risk in the unexposed.

481
01:02:58,914 --> 01:03:11,573
So we get four cases per 1000 persons. And the population attributable risk percent then is going to be the risk in the total population,

482
01:03:11,574 --> 01:03:17,604
minus the risk in the unexposed times, the divided by the risk in the total population times 100%.

483
01:03:17,874 --> 01:03:24,544
So for over 21.4. Is that simplified formula with the PR?

484
01:03:24,584 --> 01:03:28,404
And so we end up with 18.7%.

485
01:03:32,354 --> 01:03:37,604
So one thing to know about the PR is since cases can be caused by more than one exposure.

486
01:03:38,134 --> 01:03:44,324
Right. Thinking back to our PIs were very helpful for thinking about that population to global risk for a number of risk factors.

487
01:03:44,354 --> 01:03:48,674
I can add to that more than 100% is the way it is.

488
01:03:50,234 --> 01:03:58,334
All right. And in looking here at the relationship between the population attributable risk and the prevalence of exposure on the R right,

489
01:03:58,514 --> 01:04:06,334
we're going to see that the population attributable risk is going to increase substantially, really go up as either the the the earnings are.

490
01:04:06,704 --> 01:04:14,773
So the relative measure there goes up and or and or really as the prevalence of the risk factor increases.

491
01:04:14,774 --> 01:04:18,524
And so you're not going to see a huge difference there because of relatively rare.

492
01:04:21,114 --> 01:04:25,284
Risk factors are down here. As you know, the prevalence of the risk factors, 10% there.

493
01:04:25,494 --> 01:04:32,064
But even if your relative risk is doubled, when you start to see a very large difference as the prevalence of the risk factor you can see in common,

494
01:04:32,354 --> 01:04:38,724
and this is prevalence of the risk factor in the population. Yeah, this is prevalence of the risk factor in the total population.

495
01:04:39,294 --> 01:04:54,674
Right. And obviously from this paper where you can read a little bit more about those relationships if you want to.

496
01:04:57,494 --> 01:05:02,384
So what is the major difference between the attributable risk and the population attributable risk?

497
01:05:06,284 --> 01:05:14,573
But he asked. Clearly the group of people we're talking about, right?

498
01:05:14,574 --> 01:05:23,274
So the attributable risk is obviously excess risk in the exposed population, while the population of the global risk is going to be examined,

499
01:05:23,274 --> 01:05:28,824
the effect of the exposure of the entire population, including both the exposed and the unexposed individuals.

500
01:05:30,744 --> 01:05:35,384
So here is a nice kind of visual of that,

501
01:05:37,014 --> 01:05:43,463
which if I go back and re scan these in a little bit prettier so you can get the electronic images at some point.

502
01:05:43,464 --> 01:05:49,864
But anyways, here we've got the population attributable risk and the attributable risk in the among exposed.

503
01:05:49,884 --> 01:05:56,994
Right. And remember, this is always going to be larger because it depends upon the proportion of the population that has that exposure.

504
01:05:58,134 --> 01:06:02,934
So here we have an example where what do you think is happening with that proportion?

505
01:06:03,714 --> 01:06:07,014
A lot of people exposed or not that many people exposed in this population over here.

506
01:06:17,344 --> 01:06:25,354
Fewer people are exposed as the population attributable risk approaches, the attributable risk rate.

507
01:06:25,354 --> 01:06:31,174
That means that the prevalence of that exposure is becoming very common in the population.

508
01:06:32,314 --> 01:06:36,844
So when you see a large difference like that, I can tell you right away that this is not, you know,

509
01:06:36,844 --> 01:06:42,304
much difference between the exposed in the population attributable risk here tributo versus the population for the risk.

510
01:06:42,544 --> 01:06:46,744
You should immediately think like, oh, that's not a very common, you know,

511
01:06:46,744 --> 01:06:51,274
risk factor or less common risk factor, at least in the population and vice versa.

512
01:06:55,294 --> 01:07:02,794
So I know all interpretations, but these slides interpret the measures of effect as measures of impact.

513
01:07:02,794 --> 01:07:04,354
And I try to point that out as I went.

514
01:07:04,654 --> 01:07:12,424
This is that is in all examples or not at all, actually, I assume that the relationship was causal when interpreting the measure of that.

515
01:07:13,234 --> 01:07:19,174
However, the most conservative route is to not assume that the measure is causal.

516
01:07:20,584 --> 01:07:25,864
And so in the interest of time, I'm not going to go over these slides in great detail,

517
01:07:25,864 --> 01:07:30,124
but I'm going to give you a little orientation to them really quickly. So this is for political risk.

518
01:07:31,024 --> 01:07:36,874
So these are basically so there are a lot of different ways that you can correctly interpret the risk.

519
01:07:37,144 --> 01:07:41,364
There are a lot of ways you could raise it. There are also ways you can preserve input.

520
01:07:42,844 --> 01:07:50,374
And so for each of these, what we've gone through, as we say, the measure of measures and below here, this is whatever you to say, right.

521
01:07:51,184 --> 01:07:56,313
Could be a could be a risk of whatever disease that you're using.

522
01:07:56,314 --> 01:08:04,104
So essentially, you go through this and you're going to substitute, in your words, from your problem, you know,

523
01:08:04,174 --> 01:08:11,764
for the blue words in here, since I'm not saying you have to do that right, you can interpret it many other ways correctly.

524
01:08:12,454 --> 01:08:16,443
But if you struggle with the interpretation of these numbers of these measures,

525
01:08:16,444 --> 01:08:21,034
it's really good to kind of have this use this as a guide and get used to writing it off that way.

526
01:08:21,334 --> 01:08:25,914
So it makes sense. So there they are.

527
01:08:25,924 --> 01:08:29,793
I'm not going to go through them all just because we want to do a few things,

528
01:08:29,794 --> 01:08:33,544
including potentially touch on one of the quiz questions if we have enough time.

529
01:08:35,824 --> 01:08:42,094
All right. So measures and study design, this is just to kind of put it all together for us.

530
01:08:42,094 --> 01:08:45,984
Again, the study was like, we've got all these different measures, right?

531
01:08:45,994 --> 01:08:53,554
We've got the sea, air, the air, the odds ratio, the risk return, the worst percent population attributable risk and population typical risk.

532
01:08:53,734 --> 01:08:58,054
So basically, if you have a cohort with person time, you can calculate any of those.

533
01:08:59,614 --> 01:09:03,573
And usually there will be specific ones that are incompetent for specific reasons,

534
01:09:03,574 --> 01:09:10,894
but theoretically you can calculate any of them occasionally during some sections of the cohort with counts,

535
01:09:11,284 --> 01:09:14,913
you can calculate almost any of these you will not be able to calculate.

536
01:09:14,914 --> 01:09:18,574
And if you don't have, you know, person time data.

537
01:09:20,484 --> 01:09:27,074
Four case controls. On the other hand, you do not you said you don't have ladies here if you are there.

538
01:09:27,294 --> 01:09:35,244
There is a situation in which you are fairly closely from proximity to the idea of case control studies,

539
01:09:35,254 --> 01:09:42,204
and you will see some papers actually report it as an ADR rather than or although

540
01:09:42,204 --> 01:09:46,464
more recent papers will still probably report it as an hour and discuss,

541
01:09:46,974 --> 01:09:56,034
you know, what the interpretation of that or is. That's a depends on how you talk of people talk about it.

542
01:09:56,034 --> 01:10:00,443
So you don't have to worry about that too much right now. Okay. Case control studies.

543
01:10:00,444 --> 01:10:07,844
You can always do an AR. Oh, that's going to be our go to measure for case control studies under certain circumstances or special circumstances,

544
01:10:07,894 --> 01:10:11,844
you can do in population terms for this percentage.

545
01:10:12,474 --> 01:10:20,334
Remember, and we are under the circumstances, you need some information from outside the study through these different activities.

546
01:10:21,114 --> 01:10:29,864
So, you know, the incidence rate of the population and you and you can assume that the exposure level in the control is in the general population.

547
01:10:29,864 --> 01:10:35,634
And you can do this study. There you go.

548
01:10:35,644 --> 01:10:38,844
So this is kind of starting to associate our measures with our study designs.

549
01:10:39,264 --> 01:10:42,924
Right. And then we'll you will definitely look back to this later.

550
01:10:43,134 --> 01:10:44,814
And I think it's actually in the slides later.

551
01:10:44,814 --> 01:10:53,364
Again, once we've done all of our our study designs and it gets a little bit more complicated because there are many different types of case controls,

552
01:10:53,574 --> 01:11:00,104
there are of classification study results. So just kind of an overview of these measures, right?

553
01:11:00,114 --> 01:11:10,313
We put all of our measures of disease. So we have point prevalence in that period, prevalence of odds, cumulative incidence and incidence density.

554
01:11:10,314 --> 01:11:15,474
Those are the measures that you should be very familiar with either now or very soon.

555
01:11:17,134 --> 01:11:20,543
We've got our relative measures of association, right?

556
01:11:20,544 --> 01:11:28,374
That's our odds ratio, cumulative incidence ratio, incidence, density ratio, prevalence ratio and the prevalence odds ratio.

557
01:11:30,294 --> 01:11:34,524
So those are relative measures. And then we've got our absolute measures of association.

558
01:11:35,244 --> 01:11:43,454
So our risk differences attributable risk attributable to population attributable risk and in the population, which are the more risk percent.

559
01:11:48,344 --> 01:11:55,373
All right. So quickly, other measures. We have our Pearson product moment correlation coefficient.

560
01:11:55,374 --> 01:11:58,834
We polled on correlations. Right. So we don't spend much time on that in this class.

561
01:11:59,274 --> 01:12:06,114
Just the relationship between X and Y. You do not have to memorize that, so don't worry about that.

562
01:12:09,714 --> 01:12:14,384
It doesn't necessarily reflect the effect of X on the way people will often interpret it that way.

563
01:12:14,384 --> 01:12:21,524
It's just the correlation between those two, right? It's really the result of fitting a linear model to your data.

564
01:12:24,584 --> 01:12:29,444
Number needed to treat a number needed to treat is one over the attributable risk.

565
01:12:29,444 --> 01:12:32,684
You do see number needed to treat quite a bit in the in the literature.

566
01:12:34,724 --> 01:12:43,334
That is the number of people that you would have had to remove the exposure from or to treat in order to prevent one case of the disease.

567
01:12:45,074 --> 01:12:48,074
This should only really be calculated when something is causal.

568
01:12:48,914 --> 01:12:56,034
And you would say like for every x excess persons that are treated or screened or get a vaccine, you know,

569
01:12:56,054 --> 01:13:06,224
for whatever your disease or outcome of interest of one case of disease would be prevented, is how it's often presented as as one case, right?

570
01:13:06,224 --> 01:13:12,924
So in wanting to know how many vaccines do we have to hand out in order to prevent, you know,

571
01:13:12,944 --> 01:13:19,874
one hospitalization or one death, for example, did anybody go to the recent talk with Jonathan Van-Tam?

572
01:13:22,634 --> 01:13:29,713
Could anybody give an example of number needed to treat that was in his talk or what what he was talking about,

573
01:13:29,714 --> 01:13:39,014
at least when he talked about number needed to treat the justification for something that the the the UK government chose to do,

574
01:13:39,014 --> 01:13:46,673
which I actually think was a really good choice. It's going to it was used in a few different parts,

575
01:13:46,674 --> 01:13:53,754
but the one that was really clear was when they talked about like who they decided to bat that name first.

576
01:13:54,294 --> 01:13:56,184
And the vaccines were really limited. Right.

577
01:13:56,184 --> 01:14:02,673
So, you know, he walked through these risk groups because people were very unhappy that, you know, their neighbor might be able to get vaccinated.

578
01:14:02,674 --> 01:14:10,704
They couldn't get right. So they first had people living in kind of assisted care facilities or nursing homes.

579
01:14:10,704 --> 01:14:15,383
Right. Because they had the greatest risk. And then they started doing age groups going down.

580
01:14:15,384 --> 01:14:20,454
I think it was in like five or ten year age groups, so pretty finely to roll out those vaccines.

581
01:14:20,634 --> 01:14:23,544
And the justification for that was really the number needed to treat.

582
01:14:23,574 --> 01:14:35,874
How many people did you need to get that vaccine into in order to prevent, you know, one hospitalization or how many hospitalizations would you for?

583
01:14:35,964 --> 01:14:42,324
I think you presented it 4000 people or something and quite remember how it was presented.

584
01:14:42,564 --> 01:14:47,834
But you do see it quite a bit or at least we have a that.

585
01:14:48,624 --> 01:14:51,774
All right. Interval estimation of relative measures.

586
01:14:52,824 --> 01:14:55,644
We just didn't touch on this. We're not going to go through these slides in detail.

587
01:14:56,274 --> 01:15:00,744
So confidence intervals are going to be used to assess the statistical significance of an estimate.

588
01:15:01,404 --> 01:15:06,623
Right? It's interpreting confidence intervals.

589
01:15:06,624 --> 01:15:09,654
You go into great detail into the stats class bias.

590
01:15:09,654 --> 01:15:15,684
What's causing this? I'm not going to. Really make you super interpret of both.

591
01:15:17,244 --> 01:15:23,214
However, it's important that you know that confidence intervals are going to offer information on the confidence that we have in the point estimate.

592
01:15:23,964 --> 01:15:28,194
Right? The wider they are, the less confident we are about that point estimate.

593
01:15:30,924 --> 01:15:39,354
Confidence intervals, generally speaking, are going to get larger as your sample size goes up, you know, holding all else equal.

594
01:15:41,544 --> 01:15:46,314
And then it's it's really based on this hypothetical random replication of the data.

595
01:15:48,234 --> 01:15:54,414
Here's the basic formula for a confidence interval for these relative measures.

596
01:15:55,884 --> 01:16:03,714
And I think another slide has how you calculate out variance based on two by two tables.

597
01:16:04,254 --> 01:16:07,944
Okay. Quickly about sea values.

598
01:16:08,424 --> 01:16:12,323
You know, we always kind of tend to calculate 95% confidence intervals.

599
01:16:12,324 --> 01:16:13,824
That's a choice that you made at some point.

600
01:16:14,424 --> 01:16:21,774
Certainly you could kind of equally argue for 99% or you could argue at least for 99% confidence intervals or 90% confidence intervals.

601
01:16:22,044 --> 01:16:27,924
But at this point, the standard in the literature is typically to report 97% confidence intervals.

602
01:16:28,974 --> 01:16:34,284
So here are those variances for these different measures.

603
01:16:35,844 --> 01:16:43,914
And then the slides go through a step by step, how you calculate a confidence interval if you have never done that.

604
01:16:44,784 --> 01:16:49,764
I highly recommend that you go through and do it and practice it a few times.

605
01:16:50,304 --> 01:16:54,804
Katie, you did tell me earlier that, in fact, that you do occasionally for those you students here,

606
01:16:54,804 --> 01:17:02,424
you actually do occasionally how they calculate confidence intervals in in the confidence exam.

607
01:17:02,754 --> 01:17:08,484
So, you know, make sure you're aware. But most of the time we're going to be calculating confidence intervals, you know, on a computer.

608
01:17:10,014 --> 01:17:16,884
We were trying to think of scenarios where you would you know, I got in the middle of the desert and you have a computer based on how I access to.

609
01:17:17,294 --> 01:17:23,123
Yeah. Like it's hard to imagine under what circumstances you're going to be doing it by hand very much anymore.

610
01:17:23,124 --> 01:17:28,494
Although I have actually done it sitting in talks before because I'm like, That's not right.

611
01:17:28,824 --> 01:17:34,644
Right. Then I start like calculating it out really quick about a mistake that I was totally off.

612
01:17:35,274 --> 01:17:38,304
Or they don't present the confidence interval and you would like to know what it is.

613
01:17:38,724 --> 01:17:41,784
Right. That's another scenario where you might end up doing it by hand.

614
01:17:42,174 --> 01:17:47,964
So. All right. There we go.

615
01:17:48,534 --> 01:17:52,764
I'm going to go through this. All right. 5 minutes.

616
01:17:52,794 --> 01:17:57,624
We'll see how we can get through all of this. Relative rates versus absolute rates.

617
01:17:58,374 --> 01:18:04,554
So the preference, you know, for a really long time was to really to use relative rates rather than absolute rates.

618
01:18:05,484 --> 01:18:17,364
And the original thinking behind this really kind of stems back to a few studies in particular, this one, the data from this one.

619
01:18:19,074 --> 01:18:23,864
And they're looking at a cohort of people who got smokers and non smokers.

620
01:18:24,714 --> 01:18:30,384
And you go through and you calculate a ratio measure and you calculated a difference measure.

621
01:18:30,384 --> 01:18:41,004
And if you look at this in detail, one of the things that really pops out is that you get this really high low most the ratio measures.

622
01:18:42,424 --> 01:18:46,684
Smoking is very lung cancer out there anyway. Right. This is going on here smoking.

623
01:18:47,194 --> 01:18:53,644
And when you're thinking about this from like out of a more 1950s perspective of one explosion that causes one disease,

624
01:18:53,974 --> 01:18:57,094
and you can't imagine what the mechanism for some of these things might be.

625
01:18:57,454 --> 01:19:03,204
Right. You're like, well, that totally makes sense. Of course, lung cancer is going to cause smoking, right?

626
01:19:03,214 --> 01:19:06,684
Or could cause smoking. You know, we get a nice I.

627
01:19:08,244 --> 01:19:11,604
A relative risk here.

628
01:19:11,994 --> 01:19:15,744
But you start to look at the different measures. Right.

629
01:19:16,434 --> 01:19:21,174
And you see that the biggest difference measure actually is, is coronary artery disease.

630
01:19:21,904 --> 01:19:27,654
Right. Well, let's struggle a little bit more at that time.

631
01:19:27,924 --> 01:19:30,563
Like, how does that make sense? Like what's going on? Right.

632
01:19:30,564 --> 01:19:35,424
And so and you've got lots of different measures that are actually, you know, fairly high.

633
01:19:36,144 --> 01:19:41,574
Right. And so this kind of idea of one. One exposure causing one disease.

634
01:19:42,054 --> 01:19:47,844
Kind of combined with some features that I will hopefully try to go through today.

635
01:19:47,844 --> 01:19:51,143
But you know what? I'm actually going to probably put off that piece until next time,

636
01:19:51,144 --> 01:19:59,064
just so I don't really rush through it because it's not on the slides leads to to this kind of a fact.

637
01:19:59,074 --> 01:20:04,554
So really it really depends on how many cases of the disease are actually caused by something,

638
01:20:05,334 --> 01:20:09,354
you know, other than your exposure interest and what you're getting in these differences.

639
01:20:09,954 --> 01:20:14,694
All right. So what measure is best for causality?

640
01:20:15,264 --> 01:20:18,354
Which one do we want? Do we want relative measures or absolute measures?

641
01:20:19,074 --> 01:20:23,604
The dogma really was that relative risks were best for establishing etiology,

642
01:20:23,934 --> 01:20:32,274
while absolute risks indicate the public health impact of the exposure, the effect that we can have by eliminating that exposure.

643
01:20:34,264 --> 01:20:39,384
And relatively recent publications have pulled that into question.

644
01:20:40,494 --> 01:20:46,793
And I will go work through that with our causal types, which I had actually done here early enough to put on the board.

645
01:20:46,794 --> 01:20:50,334
Maybe it'll stay around till next week, so or not until Thursday. So we will see.

646
01:20:51,144 --> 01:20:56,424
We'll go through that next time. I don't do is 3 minutes enough for you for the quiz question or.

647
01:20:56,614 --> 01:21:00,864
Okay. So and with that, I will turn it over to Katie to go over.

648
01:21:02,784 --> 01:21:08,124
The first question for the patient was that many people struggle with.
