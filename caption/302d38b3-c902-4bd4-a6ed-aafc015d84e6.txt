1
00:00:23,830 --> 00:00:27,640
So this is a community clinic and we're here in the community waiting room.

2
00:00:27,790 --> 00:00:34,690
That's correct. So this waiting room is designed so that it accesses all services from this area.

3
00:00:35,530 --> 00:00:41,770
An interesting anecdote is we had focus groups done with patients in the old building as well as employees,

4
00:00:42,070 --> 00:00:46,600
and to be cognizant of all the generations and their wishes.

5
00:00:47,380 --> 00:00:54,310
We actually designed this area here for the kids to be able to be active and running and and have the sound abated a little bit,

6
00:00:54,310 --> 00:00:55,810
but yet still be able to keep an eye on them.

7
00:00:56,110 --> 00:01:01,810
And it's really what's so fascinating is that the whole waiting room really spans all the different services.

8
00:01:01,820 --> 00:01:05,200
Maybe you can point out to us all the different services that people are accessing.

9
00:01:06,070 --> 00:01:15,010
So the dental area in this corner here, the green pod over to our left, the kids area to be active in the wick department is right here,

10
00:01:15,010 --> 00:01:19,600
that pharmacy right behind them and then the blue pod is right behind us here.

11
00:01:19,870 --> 00:01:26,229
So basically when a patient comes in here, everything that they need is covered right here from where they're sitting.

12
00:01:26,230 --> 00:01:27,459
This is where everything starts.

13
00:01:27,460 --> 00:01:32,530
And whether they're seeing one of the services here or some of the services that we have on the second floor, it all starts right here.

14
00:01:35,370 --> 00:01:38,010
So we're heading into the medical unit. Correct.

15
00:01:38,340 --> 00:01:44,310
The medical unit of the center is split up into two pods, the blue pod for the University of Michigan and the green pod for Michigan State.

16
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:48,780
Each pod has two hallways and each hallway has six exam rooms and one procedure room.

17
00:01:49,110 --> 00:01:56,459
And in the design of the building, the efficiency of having three exam rooms for each provider possession allows for all the

18
00:01:56,460 --> 00:02:00,990
integrated services that we provide so that while those individuals are working with a patient,

19
00:02:00,990 --> 00:02:04,680
the provider has two more patients to see before they get back and they have to have another one ready.

20
00:02:04,950 --> 00:02:10,200
So this is really a great example of efficiency and engineering at play inside of health care.

21
00:02:10,230 --> 00:02:10,940
Significant,

22
00:02:10,950 --> 00:02:17,280
the architects had a space planning arm that started by meeting with every department and just asking basic questions of What do you do here?

23
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:23,429
So that they could work through the inefficiencies to gain efficiencies and the patients that come through here,

24
00:02:23,430 --> 00:02:29,159
are they primarily getting services paid for by Medicaid, Medicare, private payer?

25
00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:33,270
So about 30% are Medicaid, but 8% are Medicare.

26
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:37,320
Another 8% may be private insurance and the rest are uninsured.

27
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:42,270
So this is really runs the full spectrum in terms of patients coming from all kinds of different backgrounds.

28
00:02:42,270 --> 00:02:48,979
Most definitely, yes. What's interesting to me is how comprehensive the offerings are.

29
00:02:48,980 --> 00:02:50,910
And here we are in the pharmacy. That's correct.

30
00:02:50,930 --> 00:02:57,200
Chase has an in-house pharmacy that provides about 48,000 prescriptions a year, and we participate with the 340 B program,

31
00:02:57,200 --> 00:03:03,590
which is a federal program that allows us to receive drugs at a very discounted rate, which in turn we're able to pass on to our patients.

32
00:03:03,980 --> 00:03:07,160
Because if I write a prescription in the exam room, they can't get the drug.

33
00:03:07,490 --> 00:03:12,170
We're not really getting anywhere. So that really helps with access in a very significant way.

34
00:03:12,230 --> 00:03:15,790
Correct. That's why chess is considered a one stop shop.

35
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:22,460
You can come and see your dog, get your prescription, get your teeth cleaned and see behavioral health and many other services all in one visit,

36
00:03:22,730 --> 00:03:26,600
which is preferable for our patients that have very busy lives.

37
00:03:26,750 --> 00:03:31,880
Well, and I imagine that the population health contributions that jazz is trying to make as well in terms of public health,

38
00:03:32,150 --> 00:03:36,110
those are significantly helped by how much diversity of service is offered here.

39
00:03:36,140 --> 00:03:39,650
Right. Because everything that we need to do for a patient can be done in one visit as

40
00:03:39,650 --> 00:03:42,650
opposed to bringing them from multiple visits or to different sites for the visits.

41
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:46,490
So a reduction in barriers that that must mean a much easier.

42
00:03:47,050 --> 00:03:52,760
Of course, that's, that's correct. For the social determinants and social drivers, we're having significant positive impacts on that.

43
00:03:58,310 --> 00:04:02,600
Jazz seems to have so many different spaces and here we are in the lap, right?

44
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:09,200
So chess, we're doing a lot of point of care testing so we can make real time decisions on some of the chronic illnesses like diabetes,

45
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:17,270
high cholesterol and anemia. Other samples are drawn taking the Henry Ford analyze and then we get the results back on our electronic health record.

46
00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:21,980
But having the point of care testing has improved our ability to be more efficient

47
00:04:21,980 --> 00:04:25,580
in getting results back timely and making decisions even before the patient leaves.

48
00:04:25,580 --> 00:04:28,180
So we don't have to reach out two or three days online.

49
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:33,960
So if that's the case, is the lab something that is newer or is it been part of jazz for a long time?

50
00:04:33,980 --> 00:04:40,639
The lab's been around since the center's been around, but the point of care testing is what we've we've increased so that we can make

51
00:04:40,640 --> 00:04:44,060
decisions now and not have to wait so that we can get more patients through,

52
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:46,790
manage more chronic illness in an efficient way.

53
00:04:47,090 --> 00:04:52,780
So from a management and sort of health care delivery perspective, this is really efficiency at its best.

54
00:04:52,790 --> 00:04:57,139
It is. It is because we're able to do as much as we can within our scope of practice

55
00:04:57,140 --> 00:05:02,030
within the center and rely on Henry Ford for timely results on more complex labs.

56
00:05:06,230 --> 00:05:10,280
In addition to the medical unit, there's also this very sophisticated dental unit.

57
00:05:10,310 --> 00:05:15,350
There is this state of the art dental unit has six dental laboratories, four opened and two are closed.

58
00:05:15,650 --> 00:05:19,640
And we provide services from the dental hygienist all the way up to complex dental care.

59
00:05:19,910 --> 00:05:26,830
And is the dental service component at has something that is heavily used or is it something that you're more trying to promote?

60
00:05:26,840 --> 00:05:28,340
Well, we're trying to grow capacity.

61
00:05:28,340 --> 00:05:35,780
We have we have two full time dentists, one full time dental hygienist, and we're working on another dental hygienist.

62
00:05:35,780 --> 00:05:38,719
Currently, the challenge comes up with insurance.

63
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:46,910
The Medicaid now, including the ACA, expanded Medicaid has dental services in it, but most of the other insurances don't.

64
00:05:46,910 --> 00:05:52,970
And because of some of the hardware that's involved, it becomes costly and challenging and sometimes cost prohibitive for patients.

65
00:05:53,210 --> 00:06:00,770
So that has to be a big issue in terms of access because you've got medical care on one side of the community waiting room

66
00:06:01,070 --> 00:06:06,530
and on the other side you have dental where it's really challenging for patients to be able to even access the service,

67
00:06:06,530 --> 00:06:11,480
even though it's right here. That's correct. Only about 20% of our patients that come to medical are actually using dental right now.

68
00:06:11,780 --> 00:06:19,490
So we're working on patient education. We're working on some initiatives with Delta Dental of Michigan to try and do some more education campaigns,

69
00:06:19,790 --> 00:06:24,830
as well as getting people in for the preventative care to avoid some of the more costly complex care.

70
00:06:28,460 --> 00:06:30,710
What goes on in this cooking demonstration kitchen.

71
00:06:31,070 --> 00:06:40,820
So the Cooking Demonstration Kitchen came out from an idea that our nutritionists had of having a way to teach patients and employees better,

72
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:49,490
easier, low cost ways of cooking to eat healthier and improve health and wellness and chronic illness at the same time.

73
00:06:49,790 --> 00:06:55,570
And so we have chefs that come in from Henry Ford, West Bloomfield, and do cooking demonstrations.

74
00:06:55,580 --> 00:06:59,570
They're here 2 to 3 times a month, depending on the month of the year.

75
00:06:59,810 --> 00:07:07,760
And we we filled this room with patients and employees that are looking to tweak things in their diet,

76
00:07:08,150 --> 00:07:11,720
to eat a little bit healthier and improve their health and wellness. That's so interesting.

77
00:07:11,730 --> 00:07:15,920
Do you find that this kitchen is a popular part of the chess center?

78
00:07:15,950 --> 00:07:19,880
Extremely popular. We have chefs that come in from Henry Ford, West Bloomfield.

79
00:07:20,130 --> 00:07:31,640
We've actually done some research around cooking demonstrations and efforts to teach people more efficient, low cost ways to eat, to stay healthy.

80
00:07:37,220 --> 00:07:40,400
So chess seems to have so many different incredible spaces.

81
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:44,170
We're here in the wellness center. That's correct. The wellness center houses the behavioral health team.

82
00:07:44,450 --> 00:07:50,330
They're providing counseling, ongoing counseling for patients. Our La Vida domestic violence project is also housed here.

83
00:07:50,630 --> 00:07:55,910
Our community health workers. So they're engaging patients in between their visits with the medical team.

84
00:07:56,240 --> 00:08:01,220
And some of the research around community health workers is based out of here, as well as our nutritionist.

85
00:08:01,230 --> 00:08:05,930
So we sometimes have a challenge because they're battling on nutrition or nutritionists are hard to find.

86
00:08:06,680 --> 00:08:15,230
But we have currently a nutritionist that's providing dietary support for our patients that have chronic illness.

87
00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:19,850
So really, this is like mission control for wellness here in southwest Detroit.

88
00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:24,590
You could say that. You could say that it's a very important part of the services that we provide.

89
00:08:26,190 --> 00:08:27,120
Dr. Val Bueno,

90
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:36,150
thank you so much for sharing all of what you shared related to Chaz and for taking us on this outstanding tour of this incredible facility.

91
00:08:36,960 --> 00:08:44,460
I really think that what you should have taken away from this is the opportunity to understand so clearly

92
00:08:44,460 --> 00:08:50,070
how Chaz is right at the center of all the different core principles that we're going to be discussing,

93
00:08:50,310 --> 00:08:59,250
issues related to the health care system, public health, how finance and budgeting are structured inside of a real health care organization like Chaz.

94
00:08:59,520 --> 00:09:05,100
How organizations like Chaz have to contend with human resources, management, principles of negotiation,

95
00:09:05,280 --> 00:09:13,560
and all of those key things and how they contribute to advocacy at the local level, the state level, and the federal level.

96
00:09:13,740 --> 00:09:17,790
So as we're coming together to think about the next steps,

97
00:09:17,970 --> 00:09:26,310
I hope you'll really glean from this an opportunity to apply what's happening here at Chaz to everything else that we'll be discussing.
