00:00:00,450 --> 00:00:05,190
Today, before we get started, I want to talk a little bit about the objectives for these presentations.

2
00:00:05,190 --> 00:00:10,170
By the end, you will be able to identify at least two public health job resources,

3
00:00:10,170 --> 00:00:13,950
identify at least one next step in your personal career exploration.

4
00:00:13,950 --> 00:00:25,200
Understand that the career decision making process is continuous and discuss career decision making and career choices as this continual process.

5
00:00:25,200 --> 00:00:30,480
The agenda for this session is that we're going to talk a little bit about before the job search,

6
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:35,400
during the job search and after that search. I always love quotes

7
00:00:35,400 --> 00:00:37,320
So I wanted to highlight this one.

8
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:47,760
"The difference between great people and everyone else is that great people create their lives actively while everyone else is created by their lives,

9
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:55,320
passively waiting to see where life takes them next. The difference between the two, is the difference between living fully and just existing."

10
00:00:55,320 --> 00:01:00,840
And the reason I picked that quote is because when you think about your career path, it's your journey.

11
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:06,330
And unless you sort of spend time shaping it and thinking about why you're taking the steps that you're taking,

12
00:01:06,330 --> 00:01:14,120
you're not going to have an enjoyable experience. So let's get started talking about before the job search.

13
00:01:14,120 --> 00:01:21,450
This is where we find out what you like doing best. And how do we get someone to pay you to do that?

14
00:01:21,450 --> 00:01:26,160
I would like to start with your end goal in mind. What's the end goal?

15
00:01:26,160 --> 00:01:31,240
Are you thinking you want to have a specific fellowship? Do you have a specific career path in mind?

16
00:01:31,240 --> 00:01:41,640
Maybe you want to be a program director or an epidemiologist. Maybe you want a job that pays really well or has a lot of vacation time.

17
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:48,600
But I want to spend time considering how you find the right fit. Are there specific skills that you want to learn?

18
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:54,030
Do you have a specific personality or values that may be better suited to a specific job?

19
00:01:54,030 --> 00:02:01,050
Are there opportunities or training or education that you would need? Are you looking for a specific location or type of experience?

20
00:02:01,050 --> 00:02:05,850
Do you want something, let's say, less remote work? Or would you like to go into an office?

21
00:02:05,850 --> 00:02:08,400
What are your short term and long term goals?

22
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:17,900
Knowing what you need can help you save time and help you be more targeted in your approach as you consider your path.

23
00:02:17,900 --> 00:02:25,480
Another key point is leveraging your network. Throughout this program, you're going to have mentors preceptors

24
00:02:25,480 --> 00:02:30,820
And you're going to meet other FPHLP people that become a part of your FPHLP family and network.

25
00:02:30,820 --> 00:02:39,250
Keep in contact with those people. I still talk to my FPHLP members from 2013 and can reach out to them for advice as I think through my career path.

26
00:02:39,250 --> 00:02:46,690
You want to tap into that network for people who may work in fields of your interest or someone who can connect you with someone who does.

27
00:02:46,690 --> 00:02:54,610
Perhaps you want to set up an informational interview where you can learn more about that person's career trajectory, their day to day life.

28
00:02:54,610 --> 00:03:04,270
What do they do that's interesting or not interesting to you? This can help you from choosing paths or jobs that will not satisfy you later on.

29
00:03:04,270 --> 00:03:08,200
You can also ask about potential shadowing opportunities or internships,

30
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:14,710
and even perhaps they may be willing to give you a referral if it's an organization that you're applying to a job at.

31
00:03:14,710 --> 00:03:22,060
You can also go to career talks hosted by the university and try to connect with those speakers after, if possible.

32
00:03:22,060 --> 00:03:29,490
The more people you know the better the job search process or fellowship process will go.

33
00:03:29,490 --> 00:03:33,480
Another way to meet people and network is to join up an organization,

34
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:37,860
professional organizations are great ways to connect with people all over the world that

35
00:03:37,860 --> 00:03:42,150
are doing interesting things that you perhaps may have never considered or heard of.

36
00:03:42,150 --> 00:03:48,210
While I was a student, I joined the American Public Health Association and I was able to go to the conference

37
00:03:48,210 --> 00:03:52,860
because they offer discounted memberships for students. Through that conference

38
00:03:52,860 --> 00:03:57,900
I was able to network and meet other people who were interested in areas of public health

39
00:03:57,900 --> 00:04:01,980
that I was interested in and to learn more about how they got to where they were.

40
00:04:01,980 --> 00:04:10,990
These are great opportunities to build that network and see how public health is being used across the world.

41
00:04:10,990 --> 00:04:19,940
Remember that a strong network can make this process easy. Next I want to talk about getting prepared, you may have wondered why didn't start there.

42
00:04:19,940 --> 00:04:24,110
But I think a resume a cover letter and a writing sample are good.

43
00:04:24,110 --> 00:04:29,510
But having that network and knowing why you're going through this process is a little bit more important.

44
00:04:29,510 --> 00:04:33,980
You want to create or update your Linkedin profile and your digital portfolio.

45
00:04:33,980 --> 00:04:35,030
Find your references

46
00:04:35,030 --> 00:04:45,920
we talked a lot of networks. Finding people who can vouch for your ability and can confidently speak to what you will do in a position goes a long way.

47
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:54,290
Strong references help you get those jobs and close the deal and make sure to organize recommendation letters if you're considering fellowships.

48
00:04:54,290 --> 00:04:58,010
Ask ahead of time. Don't wait until the application is due.

49
00:04:58,010 --> 00:05:05,270
Talk to your recommenders or references and let them know that you'll be applying and get there, OK, before you start that process.

50
00:05:05,270 --> 00:05:11,630
You may also want to check out your own university's career resources and meet with career advisors review your documents.

51
00:05:11,630 --> 00:05:18,590
If you're a student who recently graduated, a lot of universities offer these opportunities for alumni as well.

52
00:05:18,590 --> 00:05:30,070
So reach out and ask and see what's available to you. These are two resumé resources that I recommend that everyone has access to, they're free.

53
00:05:30,070 --> 00:05:36,790
The first is resyMatch.io. It allows you to scan and compare your résumé to your target job description and then

54
00:05:36,790 --> 00:05:41,080
gives you a match score along with objective feedback on where you can improve.

55
00:05:41,080 --> 00:05:47,410
So if you don't have access to someone who can review your resume for you, this is a good way for you to make the tweaks that you need.

56
00:05:47,410 --> 00:05:56,560
They also have Resybullet.io where you can copy a bullet from your resumé and it will score it based on your ideal bullet formula.

57
00:05:56,560 --> 00:06:02,020
This can help straighten those bullets on your résumé that give you feed because it gives you

58
00:06:02,020 --> 00:06:08,320
feedback on how to improve the bullets and make it more compelling for an applicant tracking system.

59
00:06:08,320 --> 00:06:15,940
So applicant tracking systems essentially are the computer software that go through your as you may before it even hits a person.

60
00:06:15,940 --> 00:06:24,340
So you need to make sure your tailoring your resumé to hit those target objectives or job descriptions and having those keywords within them.

61
00:06:24,340 --> 00:06:26,440
These two resources can help with that.

62
00:06:26,440 --> 00:06:35,800
You can also consider talking with your advisor or your mentors about your aspirations, and they may be able to help you there as well.

63
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:40,830
Now, I want to talk a little bit about an activity that I think will help you along the way.

64
00:06:40,830 --> 00:06:47,610
You'll have access to this activity after the session. This is called understanding your values.

65
00:06:47,610 --> 00:06:53,550
You want to start with the list of values that are provided. You can add values if perhaps there is not

66
00:06:53,550 --> 00:06:59,640
there is a value that you want that's not included. Or you can stick to the values on the list.

67
00:06:59,640 --> 00:07:04,500
You choose the top 10 values and then reexamine them in order of importance.

68
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:12,150
Then change the hierarchy as necessary. By the time you're done, you'll have your top five values in the order of importance.

69
00:07:12,150 --> 00:07:18,120
Then you'd spend time reflecting on the values of what is your motivation behind choosing those values?

70
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:24,720
How do the values present themselves in your daily life? And where does each of your top 5 values come from?

71
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:29,610
I think this is essentially important as you're starting your process because you don't want to end up

72
00:07:29,610 --> 00:07:37,210
with an organization that doesn't match or isn't in line with the values that you have for yourself.

73
00:07:37,210 --> 00:07:45,310
Another activity that will be available is a journaling reflection. Here are three questions to help you get thinking about the end goal.

74
00:07:45,310 --> 00:07:50,260
What would your ideal future look like? What are things you wish you had more time or energy for,

75
00:07:50,260 --> 00:07:58,710
and if you had no limits, what would you spend the rest of your life working towards?
