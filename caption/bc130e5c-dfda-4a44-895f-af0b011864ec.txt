1
00:00:02,530 --> 00:00:05,680
Okay. So now we are recording.

2
00:00:05,800 --> 00:00:16,140
Okay. Welcome back. So Nikki and Lindsey are not coming today for some reason, so they're partners.

3
00:00:16,150 --> 00:00:20,490
Maybe they can join together. So, host Nikki.

4
00:00:20,740 --> 00:00:23,980
Nikki Richardson, your and Lindsey.

5
00:00:25,540 --> 00:00:30,160
Oh, yeah. So then you can go together. So that way you are not working.

6
00:00:30,660 --> 00:00:34,180
Everyone else has found their partners.

7
00:00:35,290 --> 00:00:39,130
Okay, good. Okay. Okay.

8
00:00:39,190 --> 00:00:52,989
So, so let me start first clarifying the, um, to this two days and next week's class.

9
00:00:52,990 --> 00:01:00,070
We are actually dealing with two topics. I mean, the remaining of the semester will be only one topic that is over two weeks.

10
00:01:00,850 --> 00:01:04,299
But today we actually have two different topics.

11
00:01:04,300 --> 00:01:11,220
I mean, they are related really, but they are two different topics. One is sources of variation in the diet and the other is measurement of the day.

12
00:01:11,320 --> 00:01:20,710
Right. So today we are going to take in some cases when I come close to you, I will put this because we are supposed to we are high risk.

13
00:01:21,220 --> 00:01:29,440
So but okay, so today we're going to talk about sources of variation in the right and then everything is together.

14
00:01:29,440 --> 00:01:33,909
So then I send you an announcement saying that the revisions for the sources of variation

15
00:01:33,910 --> 00:01:38,799
in that I are the for today is there will a chapter three and they be their article.

16
00:01:38,800 --> 00:01:45,400
But I told you you don't need to read them. Okay because what I'm beta on article is I mean you can see it 1979.

17
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:49,629
So it's kind of like a very old article. It's a classic.

18
00:01:49,630 --> 00:01:57,540
So then I think is nice to have it for your record and I'm going to kind of like use it to kind of like explain the,

19
00:01:57,670 --> 00:02:00,790
the composition of the audience and one of the tables. That's what I have it there.

20
00:02:01,030 --> 00:02:10,570
But you don't have to read it. Well, it's chapter three is basically what I'm going to splain you that I'm making it digestible.

21
00:02:10,660 --> 00:02:14,970
Okay. I mean, you are welcome to read it in detail, but it's kind of like, you know,

22
00:02:14,980 --> 00:02:22,510
I told you that Walter Willis book is fantastic, but it is difficult to kind of like digest.

23
00:02:22,810 --> 00:02:27,400
So what I'm doing actually is kind of like making it easy, making this easy for you.

24
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:31,180
So you don't need to read it, but you can give it for your records for consultation.

25
00:02:31,210 --> 00:02:38,860
Okay. So today there were no really mandatory events for next week that we will be talking about my shooting

26
00:02:39,190 --> 00:02:46,540
diet that those four readings will are they are mandatory because we will discuss them a little bit.

27
00:02:46,540 --> 00:02:51,669
Right. And it looks like for readings I told you remember, they are not for ratings, okay?

28
00:02:51,670 --> 00:02:59,409
They are not for articles. There is just one article which is the super article and then bias is the editorial.

29
00:02:59,410 --> 00:03:09,700
I mean, it was an article that was editorials and blog and well, it is the kind of like the, the, the, the commentaries.

30
00:03:09,700 --> 00:03:15,639
Right. So they are short. So they, they, so there's one article and three short things related to the article.

31
00:03:15,640 --> 00:03:20,860
Right. And they would like you to read them in the order that they are in their, in their syllabus.

32
00:03:20,860 --> 00:03:24,520
I think I'm not sure if I gave you the one other order with Blogger.

33
00:03:24,850 --> 00:03:32,560
I mean, you can check the page numbers anyway, right. So kind of like with first editorial, then the article and then the two commentaries.

34
00:03:32,710 --> 00:03:39,130
Okay. And, and please read them because I mean, otherwise, you would be kind of like lost when we talk about that.

35
00:03:39,580 --> 00:03:40,719
Okay. So those are the readings.

36
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:48,700
And then you can see that there are two lectures because today we will be dealing with radiation in the diet and next week with measuring diet.

37
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:51,939
I did change a few things this morning.

38
00:03:51,940 --> 00:03:57,940
So you downloaded this yesterday before this morning, downloaded again because they had a few different things.

39
00:03:57,940 --> 00:04:01,149
Okay. And then we'll go into the lab.

40
00:04:01,150 --> 00:04:05,200
The lab. This is the document for the lab. The lab has part one and part two.

41
00:04:05,260 --> 00:04:09,400
Today, we will deal with part one. Next week we will deal with part two.

42
00:04:09,640 --> 00:04:11,860
But note that they are two different datasets.

43
00:04:11,860 --> 00:04:21,610
So the variation that I said is for part one, the validation is for part two, I believe, but that's kind of like a spleen in there in the lab.

44
00:04:21,640 --> 00:04:28,900
Right. And then this is the lab building that you already have check and then you have here the the link to the assignment.

45
00:04:28,900 --> 00:04:34,209
Once you are ready to upload that, that that will be in three weeks.

46
00:04:34,210 --> 00:04:40,630
Right. So you have because we will be working on the first part this Friday, next Friday on the second part.

47
00:04:40,630 --> 00:04:46,480
And then you will have to kind of like uploaded on the before the the following Friday.

48
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:54,310
Right. Okay. So, so once we go to other topics, everything will be more simple because I mean, it's just one topic.

49
00:04:55,420 --> 00:04:58,780
Okay. And then I put my Panopto. Yeah.

50
00:04:58,780 --> 00:05:04,719
So I think I'm, I'm recording because. I don't know what happened last week.

51
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:09,430
Sorry that that Lindsay couldn't come to class.

52
00:05:09,430 --> 00:05:13,719
And then she was looking for the recording, and it was not that. And now I can see that is there.

53
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:20,290
So then, I don't know, maybe it takes a lot of time. I don't know. But I, hopefully I, I mean, I think it's recording.

54
00:05:20,290 --> 00:05:25,230
I mean, it can see that is recording and you can see myself and the owl is kind of like looking at me.

55
00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:31,750
I know it is creepy, but anyway, okay so let's let's start the class.

56
00:05:33,310 --> 00:05:42,850
So, so this is what the, the, the main kind of like scenes that we are going to discuss today on the surface of variation and divide.

57
00:05:42,850 --> 00:05:50,830
Right? So the first thing is that the variability in that I produces misclassification, we will see that which I mean makes a lot of sense.

58
00:05:51,130 --> 00:05:54,820
I mean, the first thing is that they are this very variable. I mean, they'll have to tell you that.

59
00:05:54,850 --> 00:05:58,150
I mean, you know that you know that people don't eat the same thing every day.

60
00:05:58,210 --> 00:06:01,330
Right? So there is a lot of variation day to day. Right.

61
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:07,200
But that variability is kind of like introducing error, right.

62
00:06:07,420 --> 00:06:16,149
And misclassification. And we will see why. Then we will talk about the effect of sampling on the distribution of intake because of that variability,

63
00:06:16,150 --> 00:06:21,940
because the age that ideally you really want to know what someone is eating,

64
00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:27,490
you will just be kind of like asking that person every single day in the life, right?

65
00:06:27,760 --> 00:06:31,390
So then that way you have the whole picture, but clearly you cannot do that, right?

66
00:06:31,750 --> 00:06:36,150
Clearly you have to sample you have to ask just a few of these, right?

67
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:42,729
Particularly when you have a very large study, let's say that you have 100,000 people, you cannot even ask them.

68
00:06:42,730 --> 00:06:50,740
Like, I mean, just even seven days, seven, 24 hour recalls is like crazy, right, for 100,000 people.

69
00:06:50,740 --> 00:06:57,640
So you how many of you have kind of like analyzed 24 hour recalls using their dietary software?

70
00:06:57,670 --> 00:07:07,479
Have you done that before? No. Have you collected yourself 24 hour records and you know how complex that information is?

71
00:07:07,480 --> 00:07:12,040
So I can imagine transforming that into kind of like data that you can analyze.

72
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:16,030
So imagine that by 7 a.m. by 100,000, right?

73
00:07:16,270 --> 00:07:21,070
So it's this a lot so many times we need to kind of like collate just a few days.

74
00:07:21,100 --> 00:07:27,430
Right. And that's a compromise because of budget resources, time and everything and visibility.

75
00:07:27,640 --> 00:07:31,360
But at the same time, everything we are sampling, we know we are losing information.

76
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:36,760
Right, because of the variability. We are being less accurate and that has very important repercussions.

77
00:07:36,790 --> 00:07:43,900
Right? Then we will go to kind of like understand a little bit about the sources of the variability in the diet.

78
00:07:44,380 --> 00:07:55,510
And even though I will be asking you about different specific things, in the end, the usual thing is that we just divided into big groups.

79
00:07:55,840 --> 00:08:00,639
One thing is that between person variation, which is the one we get about right, because this is I mean,

80
00:08:00,640 --> 00:08:07,629
I really want to make sure that I can assign everyone like, you know, usual intake.

81
00:08:07,630 --> 00:08:07,900
Right.

82
00:08:08,170 --> 00:08:17,890
And the other thing is that within person variation how, how your how anything that you are eating changes today that we are going to consider error.

83
00:08:18,190 --> 00:08:23,679
That's not real error is because this is true variation, right?

84
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:32,080
I mean, you don't eat the same things every day, but for the purposes of the analysis, we will consider like category like random error.

85
00:08:32,110 --> 00:08:41,070
Okay. So just kind of Liberation Day today and then we will see how we can kind of like get rid of the we percent variation.

86
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:50,170
And that's, that's what the lab is about. So get rid of the error in the back series, kind of like in Spanish with the what if you.

87
00:08:50,900 --> 00:08:59,410
So there's an interrupt. Okay, so so we will use ANOVA, the analysis of variance to decompose the variance.

88
00:08:59,560 --> 00:09:05,889
Okay. And then I, I'm assuming that all of you know, I know about, but still I do like a short review.

89
00:09:05,890 --> 00:09:11,770
So then we are on the same page. So we will decompose the variance to get rid of the with important variation.

90
00:09:12,100 --> 00:09:18,159
And finally, I will explain how that variation in the they actually attenuate associations that way.

91
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:23,730
So important to get rid of that error. Okay. And then not to myself, I'm already recording, so that's good.

92
00:09:24,370 --> 00:09:35,620
Okay. So the key point about the variation in the diet is that what we really get in diet, in epidemiologic studies is the long term diet, right?

93
00:09:35,950 --> 00:09:42,150
So I, I don't care what you weigh just that way because that may not be a representative of what you eat everyday.

94
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:46,710
Basically yesterday was your birthday or some myself birthdays.

95
00:09:46,780 --> 00:09:54,880
Maybe you have a huge piece of chocolate cake which is kind of like great, but you don't have chocolate cake every single day, right?

96
00:09:55,360 --> 00:10:00,460
Hopefully not. Right. So so that doesn't represent your long time.

97
00:10:00,730 --> 00:10:02,590
What we really care is. The long term.

98
00:10:03,140 --> 00:10:13,640
But so we had to think about kind of like diet instead of kind of thinking about something like goals like that.

99
00:10:13,660 --> 00:10:20,620
And then when I'm doing this, I'm doing that for any nutrition or any food or anything, whatever, right?

100
00:10:20,860 --> 00:10:27,910
So imagine I'm thinking about total fat. Your total fat is some this is going to be a little higher and this is going to be a little lower.

101
00:10:28,180 --> 00:10:38,350
But the idea is that what I guess is that what is your more or less how do you think I'm going to consider that more or less?

102
00:10:38,530 --> 00:10:42,930
Gosh, that is never quite right because I base right.

103
00:10:45,700 --> 00:10:52,530
Right. So one day will be high when they will be closer to the average, when they will be lower than they would be high.

104
00:10:52,780 --> 00:10:55,690
Sometimes it can be really high. So I think you can be very long. Right.

105
00:10:56,020 --> 00:11:02,229
So I kind of really analyze this because this place embodies a lot of money issues.

106
00:11:02,230 --> 00:11:05,330
So what I'm going to analyze is like an average, right?

107
00:11:05,350 --> 00:11:11,830
Like a constant kind of like I'm having to I can be and I'm going to assume these these variations,

108
00:11:12,970 --> 00:11:18,940
like if it was ever a negative, this is not valid because it's money issue.

109
00:11:19,240 --> 00:11:25,990
But we are we're going to assume that for the purposes of the analysis is like random error that we want to get rid of.

110
00:11:26,110 --> 00:11:30,099
Right. We want to just keep this because maybe you are here.

111
00:11:30,100 --> 00:11:38,020
Let's assume that this is like just two grams of fat, but maybe other people are more lucky if they have a higher intake of fun.

112
00:11:38,260 --> 00:11:47,320
And they also would have any kind of memory issue. Right. But that no knowledge, they maybe know around 90 grams and they pick one maybe here.

113
00:11:47,380 --> 00:11:51,160
Right. And they again, they say they have hypertension.

114
00:11:51,460 --> 00:11:58,180
But what I want is to classify everyone to that average in that you slide lower.

115
00:11:58,990 --> 00:12:02,560
Right. And that and the rest will be considered.

116
00:12:02,590 --> 00:12:10,720
Yes. That variation from day to day that we will consider ever that variation can be sometimes not only random.

117
00:12:10,780 --> 00:12:21,639
So the random thing kind of like a that I put random in quotes because again it's not random because usually what happened is that some but the

118
00:12:21,640 --> 00:12:29,709
way you think about calories when you eat about one day the next day you tend to be a homicide is the next day you will eat less because I mean,

119
00:12:29,710 --> 00:12:35,200
you feel beautiful, right? So so that's actually not really random, right.

120
00:12:35,410 --> 00:12:40,510
But doesn't matter for the purposes of this statistical analysis, we will consider it, right?

121
00:12:40,510 --> 00:12:44,409
Like but then maybe also systematic variation, right.

122
00:12:44,410 --> 00:12:48,100
So sometimes you make it differently by season, right?

123
00:12:48,370 --> 00:12:55,209
Because in this summer you made more fruit for example, and then you may have more micronutrients that what you eat in the winter.

124
00:12:55,210 --> 00:13:03,970
Right. So we need to understand well those sources of variation to make sure that we

125
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:11,500
are able to kind of like assign everyone like a constant long term intake.

126
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:19,340
So this is what I was trying to kind of like put there with with big stuff.

127
00:13:19,340 --> 00:13:27,680
But this is real data. So these are kind of like they do they total fat intake for three people, the first three women.

128
00:13:28,010 --> 00:13:38,030
And then what they did here is that they actually collected 28 vs 28 does what I think they believe or not even 34 or whatever.

129
00:13:38,030 --> 00:13:41,990
So it's kind of like this is very accurate data, right? Every single day.

130
00:13:42,050 --> 00:13:47,510
Right. And then they estimate it, then they they find it.

131
00:13:47,750 --> 00:13:49,750
And when they did, they did that with more people. Right.

132
00:13:49,790 --> 00:14:00,829
But then they selected three people who were kind of like representing the 1050 and 90th percentile of the population distribution.

133
00:14:00,830 --> 00:14:06,800
Right. So what they did is that they take someone who was in the middle on their fat distribution for that population,

134
00:14:07,070 --> 00:14:10,430
someone who was at the high stream and someone who was at the lowest stream.

135
00:14:10,580 --> 00:14:15,110
Right. So that way, I mean, we can see what happened with the with a variation.

136
00:14:15,110 --> 00:14:21,230
And then you can see that really we should have like something like this like one year there.

137
00:14:21,350 --> 00:14:24,950
And but we don't we have that huge variation, right?

138
00:14:25,400 --> 00:14:36,620
So if we go and take day four, then this is kind of like the fat intake of the person who's at the 90th percentile,

139
00:14:36,620 --> 00:14:38,360
which is like, that's great, right?

140
00:14:39,110 --> 00:14:47,420
This will be the one for the person at the median, the fifth percentile, which again is kind of like right in the middle, more or less.

141
00:14:47,780 --> 00:14:52,040
And this is the one for the person in the 10th percentile.

142
00:14:52,100 --> 00:15:00,590
Right. So this is kind of like low fat. Right. And then you can see that they can they for less than maybe one is what it should be.

143
00:15:00,680 --> 00:15:06,200
Right. But what happens if instead of taking the fourth, we actually take this other one?

144
00:15:08,530 --> 00:15:22,060
See if you take that one. Could you see the how the the little one really that they increase around and the high ones that they make this out.

145
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:25,550
And the other one was kind of like in between.

146
00:15:25,690 --> 00:15:37,030
Right. So then what happened is that now I have the low one actually the highest then and then the the high one is kind of like in the middle,

147
00:15:37,030 --> 00:15:40,959
but those are low and the and the medium one is still in the middle.

148
00:15:40,960 --> 00:15:44,050
But kind of like now the three of them are kind of like in the middle.

149
00:15:44,200 --> 00:15:56,380
Right. So then imagine that. Now I tell you, okay, what happens is if you take just one day out of the 20 days and then you took this one,

150
00:15:58,360 --> 00:16:02,110
they said, okay, for classifying people in their corresponding percentile.

151
00:16:02,710 --> 00:16:07,810
Yes. Right. But what happened is you were unlucky and you do this.

152
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:12,100
They. Is that okay to classify people?

153
00:16:12,550 --> 00:16:15,790
No, because we know that. Whatever. Yeah. Right.

154
00:16:16,030 --> 00:16:20,890
So you think only that they basically you are completely misclassify those three people.

155
00:16:21,280 --> 00:16:27,640
You are assuming that they're three are probably in their 50th percentile while one is in the 10th and the others in the 90th.

156
00:16:28,150 --> 00:16:32,139
So you can see that it has tremendous implications.

157
00:16:32,140 --> 00:16:35,020
That's why that's why it is not good to take only one day.

158
00:16:35,260 --> 00:16:40,060
You need to take a few days to kind of like make sure that you can calculate more or less the long term.

159
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:44,320
Right. And this is for total fat and typical total fat.

160
00:16:44,830 --> 00:16:49,910
I mean, the macronutrients actually, in theory don't vary that much.

161
00:16:50,020 --> 00:16:52,840
They do. They I mean, they vary, but not that much.

162
00:16:53,340 --> 00:16:59,500
You go and do it for vitamin A, for example, for my clothing, you can see that the variations are even huge.

163
00:16:59,770 --> 00:17:02,650
I mean, here you have someone probably like an a blazer,

164
00:17:02,890 --> 00:17:10,660
never seen you in a but you can see how the person in the 50% they under 10% they is completely, you know,

165
00:17:11,140 --> 00:17:18,010
mix right with the two of them because one has really huge peaks and then on average them is that vitamin,

166
00:17:18,140 --> 00:17:22,299
they will be high and the other a little lower. So then on average will be lower.

167
00:17:22,300 --> 00:17:28,660
But then clearly because most peaks overlap, sometimes they will be also even more misclassification and even more error.

168
00:17:28,870 --> 00:17:32,320
Right. So for micronutrients, this is even worse.

169
00:17:32,980 --> 00:17:38,920
So you take only one day and then you're misclassification is going to be all over the place will be huge.

170
00:17:39,130 --> 00:17:46,380
Huge. So this is that you can do the same exercise here and you can see how they are completely.

171
00:17:46,380 --> 00:17:51,330
I mean, the one on the shoulder is okay, but then the other two are completely reverse.

172
00:17:51,540 --> 00:18:02,880
Right. Okay. So the key point after this exercise is that collecting only one day of dietary information may lead to tremendous misclassification.

173
00:18:03,720 --> 00:18:11,010
And this is not a not negligible or non-trivial issue, because in the past, I mean, not any more, but in the past,

174
00:18:11,010 --> 00:18:16,889
many kind of like major studies collecting only 124 hour recall that actually happened in a haze.

175
00:18:16,890 --> 00:18:19,080
I mean, they hence a few days ago,

176
00:18:19,410 --> 00:18:27,000
they were only collecting 124 hour recall and then they were taking kind of like remember and hence is supposed to be nationally representative.

177
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:34,200
Everyone knows what think is right. Okay, so they're supposed to be nationally representative.

178
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:40,320
And then you were just using 124 hour recall to get information about the nutrition of the country.

179
00:18:40,350 --> 00:18:44,840
Right. Which is kind of like, well, I mean, then we are completely all over the place, but I am you.

180
00:18:44,870 --> 00:18:52,440
But you can really say that that representing the whole country because of the so much error misclassification that you can get right.

181
00:18:53,850 --> 00:18:58,470
One thing is that that misclassification remember this opportunity because region

182
00:18:58,530 --> 00:19:03,720
is random and we will assume that is random will attenuate the association.

183
00:19:03,870 --> 00:19:10,529
Right. So at least one bias against the null admissible kind of like goes towards the null.

184
00:19:10,530 --> 00:19:15,600
So that the worst case scenario is that whatever you are looking at, it will be attenuated.

185
00:19:15,780 --> 00:19:18,989
But but that's not good either, right? So I'm not saying that that's not important.

186
00:19:18,990 --> 00:19:22,620
It's just that at least it's not like that could be a bias in the other direction.

187
00:19:24,630 --> 00:19:27,870
And that will explain a little more on this level. Okay.

188
00:19:27,960 --> 00:19:37,140
So the other thing is that if we start thinking about that sampling process, like, okay, that's fine.

189
00:19:37,140 --> 00:19:41,940
I mean, that experiment that I show you was kind of like they collected 28 days because they

190
00:19:41,940 --> 00:19:46,229
were doing absolute validation study and they precisely wanted to show that validation,

191
00:19:46,230 --> 00:19:49,469
right? But in most studies, you won't be able to collect 28 days.

192
00:19:49,470 --> 00:19:53,550
That's a lot. At most, you make ethanol five or seven.

193
00:19:53,610 --> 00:20:01,460
That's the usual kind of like number. Right. So then what happened when you call it only five, seven, or did you call it only one?

194
00:20:01,490 --> 00:20:06,090
Right. If someone cannot really for more, sometimes they will call it only one, which is not good.

195
00:20:06,120 --> 00:20:12,840
Right. So this is this is a distribution of that affecting the whole population that we saw before.

196
00:20:12,900 --> 00:20:18,290
Right. So then you can see that is as most not a skew distribution.

197
00:20:18,290 --> 00:20:21,179
This is not really normal because well, I mean,

198
00:20:21,180 --> 00:20:29,190
it usually is bounded because you going to have negative values of total violence in relation to having zero.

199
00:20:29,190 --> 00:20:38,909
Right. Which I mean wherever you have state or you may have very little but not take away, but there must be full of 60 grams per day.

200
00:20:38,910 --> 00:20:40,770
Right. And then other people,

201
00:20:40,770 --> 00:20:47,249
people more or less around a few people have a really low intake of five and then you have a few people with really high intakes.

202
00:20:47,250 --> 00:20:49,469
Those are more kind of liars, right?

203
00:20:49,470 --> 00:20:57,180
But still, what I mean when I say outliers, I mean because most of which is not normal, but those are not that are plausible index.

204
00:20:57,180 --> 00:21:04,170
I mean, some people have a high degree like so this is your kind of like population distribution of the population.

205
00:21:04,650 --> 00:21:15,719
Now if you take your sample instead of the 28 days that they use here, you sample only going to like a few,

206
00:21:15,720 --> 00:21:20,100
but at least kind of like maybe let's say ten days,

207
00:21:20,100 --> 00:21:28,979
which is a lot is still by the probability that those go into the most frequent ones is really is higher.

208
00:21:28,980 --> 00:21:34,350
Right. So you have clearly you have more days, more days here that here.

209
00:21:34,740 --> 00:21:40,000
So the more days you sample, the more you will have here representing the to average.

210
00:21:40,510 --> 00:21:44,670
Right. So then in that situation you accept.

211
00:21:45,030 --> 00:21:52,169
So in that situation, you will be closer to the average with just a few days, let's say ten days or seven days.

212
00:21:52,170 --> 00:22:00,480
Right. But if you isolate only one day, even though I mean the liberal ability of getting one of the most frequent wants is higher

213
00:22:00,570 --> 00:22:08,160
because there are more you may be unlucky and then get one of those days by chance.

214
00:22:08,370 --> 00:22:13,259
Instead of one of those, you get one of those. So then you get one of those.

215
00:22:13,260 --> 00:22:21,690
And then what happened is that you will be assuming that your population on average is having a total fat intake of 140 grams, which is not true.

216
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:25,680
I mean, you know, that is kind of like around 60, right?

217
00:22:26,910 --> 00:22:37,890
So that's why when you kind of like isolate only a few days, the less they feel you select the Y, their your population distribution becomes.

218
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:44,360
So you this is for vitamin. And this is for let's look at the first total five.

219
00:22:44,710 --> 00:22:49,810
So this is for the four weeks of this, we are going to consider that this is the true distribution.

220
00:22:49,810 --> 00:22:55,990
We are going to assume that when you have 28, this is so accurate that this is a true distribution of total fat in the population.

221
00:22:56,260 --> 00:23:03,580
And you can see that is like a normal distribution because I mean, are this is not kind of like the the your nutrient intake of one person.

222
00:23:03,940 --> 00:23:11,080
This is kind of like the the average this is the distribution of the average and total fat for each person.

223
00:23:11,090 --> 00:23:17,680
Right? So you can see that most people are around 60, but there are some people who take lessons from people who they model.

224
00:23:17,800 --> 00:23:24,100
Right. And this is kind of like the moment you start kind of like not taking the four weeks,

225
00:23:24,100 --> 00:23:28,390
but one week, for example, your sampling of radiation, you are only taking seven days.

226
00:23:29,050 --> 00:23:38,080
What happened? You can see that your distribution is becoming wider and when you go to only one day, it becomes even wider.

227
00:23:38,410 --> 00:23:46,540
Why? Because just by chance, you are picking those extremes by the people who have very low or the people who have very high,

228
00:23:47,020 --> 00:23:53,950
that if you take seven days, you still may take them, but on average they will be closer to the mean.

229
00:23:54,310 --> 00:24:00,640
But if you take only one for those people and they are outliers, they will show up here, right?

230
00:24:01,090 --> 00:24:09,220
So then the effect of sampling is that your distribution becomes wider and the same for vitamin A,

231
00:24:09,250 --> 00:24:14,860
you can see that this should be the normal distribution so that through distribution,

232
00:24:14,980 --> 00:24:20,320
through intake, then the moment you start sampling, you can see it is becoming more women.

233
00:24:20,320 --> 00:24:27,610
They are kind of like only sample one is very white and then you can see that is actually very skewed because you have many,

234
00:24:27,610 --> 00:24:34,990
many layers of people with very high intake of migrant intake just because that they maybe they had a supplement, right?

235
00:24:38,110 --> 00:24:46,090
So bottom line, collecting only one day of information will give you a wider population distribution.

236
00:24:47,050 --> 00:24:54,100
And this is because of that within personal variation, right? Because of that, because you are collecting some of the streams by chance.

237
00:24:54,190 --> 00:24:58,480
Right. And then will happen and we are going to see this in the lab,

238
00:24:58,900 --> 00:25:08,410
is that they are going to overestimate the people who are deficient or eating too much of any nutrient at a population level.

239
00:25:08,620 --> 00:25:15,940
Right. So if your population distribution, your true intake is like this.

240
00:25:19,940 --> 00:25:23,630
And you want to know how many people are below a certain amount.

241
00:25:24,380 --> 00:25:28,310
You will be making this a bit much.

242
00:25:28,410 --> 00:25:35,780
Right. But I need you to. This distribution becomes wider because of with no person ever.

243
00:25:36,860 --> 00:25:45,050
And then you are saying this becomes much more higher than this.

244
00:25:45,230 --> 00:25:52,100
Right? So drug overestimating, medical mistakes made people lives either deficient or eating too much.

245
00:25:52,190 --> 00:25:57,860
And that's been important for kind of like dietary guidelines and dietary monitoring.

246
00:25:57,860 --> 00:26:07,730
Right. Because, I mean, you want to have accurate estimates. You want to know if, for example, you have 20% people deficient in vitamin D or just 2%.

247
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:14,540
Right. I mean, this is a huge difference. Right. So you want to make sure that that 20% is not because of error.

248
00:26:14,750 --> 00:26:21,340
You want to estimate that it's only 2%. Right. And we will see how to get that in the.

249
00:26:21,770 --> 00:26:24,830
Okay. Okay.

250
00:26:25,160 --> 00:26:39,150
So now. I'm going to kind of like ask you to imagine that I'm going to recruit you, the 15 of you,

251
00:26:39,630 --> 00:26:46,800
for I study and I'm going to collect your daily intake, right, for 2018, for example, over six months.

252
00:26:46,920 --> 00:26:51,300
That's not regular information. But imagine that. That's right.

253
00:26:52,500 --> 00:26:56,550
So now this will be your study population.

254
00:26:57,630 --> 00:27:04,710
So imagine I'm asking you about which factors may affect your total fat intake.

255
00:27:06,210 --> 00:27:14,550
Kind of like what are the kind of like differences between you that may affect your fat intake?

256
00:27:16,530 --> 00:27:21,220
And what are the differences within you that may affect your total fat intake?

257
00:27:21,240 --> 00:27:28,230
Right. So that clearly I mean, there will be some people who will have a higher intake than others because of whatever.

258
00:27:28,500 --> 00:27:32,220
Right. And I want you to tell me what could be the reasons.

259
00:27:32,670 --> 00:27:37,650
And also, within every person, there are reasons why your total fat intake may be higher or lower.

260
00:27:38,520 --> 00:27:43,120
One way or the other. Right. So tell me, just kind of like there's no right.

261
00:27:43,140 --> 00:27:53,310
One answer. So the main things that could affect your total fat intake, like more than one with one person within one person and between.

262
00:27:53,310 --> 00:27:58,620
Between person, both between and within between and between all those.

263
00:27:58,620 --> 00:28:02,490
It could be interesting in preferences, maybe cultural.

264
00:28:02,790 --> 00:28:08,730
Yeah. So kind of like dietary patterns. And then of course, I mean, some reporters are higher than others.

265
00:28:08,940 --> 00:28:17,670
Yeah. Other the things like having too many classes that they have high so that you go they have fast food.

266
00:28:18,150 --> 00:28:24,330
Yeah, exactly. So then that that some some days you really change your reporting because of you don't have that.

267
00:28:24,700 --> 00:28:31,690
So what is the mood of the mood of the day or exercise?

268
00:28:32,040 --> 00:28:35,790
Exactly. This that your exercise can be a flutter that changed your.

269
00:28:35,820 --> 00:28:39,059
Yeah, you can. You can you may need more kind of like calories.

270
00:28:39,060 --> 00:28:42,510
And some of those countries can come in the form of fat. Yeah. What else?

271
00:28:44,670 --> 00:28:52,080
Just kind of going off of that. If you just tend to eat more calories like you're you require more calories in another version.

272
00:28:52,500 --> 00:28:58,890
Yeah, exactly. So that that's a good. So what are the reasons that will why why would you require more calories?

273
00:28:59,310 --> 00:29:05,370
I mean, we have a very homogeneous kind of like population in terms of sex here.

274
00:29:05,370 --> 00:29:10,490
Right. So but imagine that there were more than ten.

275
00:29:10,980 --> 00:29:14,400
Yeah. Even if you're pregnant. Yeah, exactly.

276
00:29:14,410 --> 00:29:18,650
So some men are bigger. They need more calories than women and get it out.

277
00:29:18,660 --> 00:29:23,530
Right. So. But even within women, there are women who are taller and women who are shorter.

278
00:29:23,560 --> 00:29:26,610
Right. So then the taller women need more calories, right? So.

279
00:29:26,730 --> 00:29:31,340
Exactly. So that's kind of like like height, weight, exercise.

280
00:29:31,350 --> 00:29:34,860
All those things are going to lie. Subsets of between personal vitality.

281
00:29:34,860 --> 00:29:40,470
Worse, I'm not sure but correct. Be like if a particular supplement comes out of that like.

282
00:29:42,300 --> 00:29:48,250
Yeah. I mean. Yeah, I mean you have you mean hormone supplements or some types of medications or whatever?

283
00:29:48,270 --> 00:29:53,220
Yeah, exactly. I mean, some of you may are on certain medications that require more fat.

284
00:29:53,910 --> 00:29:58,220
Yeah, as you said. Yeah.

285
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:05,010
Yeah. But like, whether it's a weekday or a weekend day and also whether it's like a holiday.

286
00:30:05,160 --> 00:30:08,310
Yeah. So that's part of your within person variation.

287
00:30:09,540 --> 00:30:13,799
Yeah, exactly. So that refers to a person with in person variation.

288
00:30:13,800 --> 00:30:17,070
You don't eat the same during the week and then they're in their wake.

289
00:30:17,370 --> 00:30:21,390
Yeah. And the same holidays or special occasions. That's, that's a very good one.

290
00:30:21,930 --> 00:30:29,309
So we could, I mean, we could spend the rest of the class coming up with kind of like different things that

291
00:30:29,310 --> 00:30:34,200
would allow us to build a model that splits the variability in your total fat intake.

292
00:30:34,710 --> 00:30:37,590
But actually what happened is that in the end,

293
00:30:38,370 --> 00:30:46,860
all factors can be grouped into those that displaying variability between people and those that explain variability within people.

294
00:30:46,950 --> 00:30:53,429
Right. So those are the two main things that we are going to take into account here, the between person variability.

295
00:30:53,430 --> 00:30:54,960
And then we think person variability.

296
00:30:55,260 --> 00:31:02,880
And what happens is that we are considered, we think person variability error that we want to get rid of because of that.

297
00:31:03,120 --> 00:31:12,720
Remember, I mean, I don't guarantee you if you don't have those like, you know, these braces kind of like.

298
00:31:12,980 --> 00:31:16,200
I know, I know. I want to classify you later. Right.

299
00:31:16,200 --> 00:31:20,520
I know. What I want to keep is the difference between before.

300
00:31:20,700 --> 00:31:23,880
Right. But I don't mean that we think for somebody.

301
00:31:24,240 --> 00:31:27,900
So I think everything we want to look today is how to.

302
00:31:28,030 --> 00:31:30,760
Get rid of that with important body issue. Okay.

303
00:31:31,960 --> 00:31:40,630
So and that was the the classic kind of like sending a paper by vetoing that because they extremely variable from day to day.

304
00:31:40,630 --> 00:31:46,450
And there are many sources of variability in the that he wanted to understand what are the main sources.

305
00:31:46,450 --> 00:31:51,669
Right. And then he used ANOVA to partition the variance, modeling it in between and within.

306
00:31:51,670 --> 00:31:57,549
But they he also actually initially explore other factors that can be classified as

307
00:31:57,550 --> 00:32:03,510
between to but they he wanted to understand some specific factors individually right.

308
00:32:03,520 --> 00:32:11,140
So they were between a within but he wanted to explore okay let's see, this kind of like factor is very important, right?

309
00:32:11,470 --> 00:32:17,410
So what he did and this is the kind of like main that they were from that they

310
00:32:17,410 --> 00:32:21,580
think is that besides the relative contribution of their self to somebody.

311
00:32:21,580 --> 00:32:29,110
That's right. And then he has maybe kind of gave notice here you can see that these proteins that are hybrid form subdivided more normally,

312
00:32:29,110 --> 00:32:32,380
their bodies that would eat their ratio on cholesterol. Right.

313
00:32:32,680 --> 00:32:35,770
And those those the microbicide is supposed to protect that.

314
00:32:35,770 --> 00:32:36,730
If I know do that.

315
00:32:36,760 --> 00:32:46,749
And there'd be a ratio of milligrams per 1000 kilocalories and cholesterol from milligrams, but of 100 grams of like I think divided females.

316
00:32:46,750 --> 00:32:51,350
And so he already kind of like got rid of one of the between person.

317
00:32:51,370 --> 00:32:56,079
But that is important, right? Because that's that's really a big one, right?

318
00:32:56,080 --> 00:33:05,080
So you don't want that what you want and of like to be more clear in what are they specific things you want to do that stratification for like so

319
00:33:05,080 --> 00:33:16,330
you have messier and we have this here and then you can see that the why it seems that he is blocked by some hints which is what we called between.

320
00:33:16,900 --> 00:33:20,470
So let me kind of let me show you here.

321
00:33:23,230 --> 00:33:29,650
He slowly saw that he sees this sequence the way that they kind of like the sequence is kind of like the

322
00:33:29,650 --> 00:33:37,210
way that that the day of the other week was not one day of the week and sequence was still a memory,

323
00:33:37,780 --> 00:33:45,880
but it was something that the way that kind of like it was if either they work together or work differently apart or something like that.

324
00:33:47,140 --> 00:33:52,380
The interviewer because the interviewer may be a source of liability, which I mean, we know, right,

325
00:33:53,590 --> 00:33:59,590
that day of the week which already mentioned here and they were he called

326
00:33:59,590 --> 00:34:04,540
received well which is the with break so they he of a good many of the we think

327
00:34:05,200 --> 00:34:12,759
here I think the fact that like yeah but he also brought this three separately thinking that they could be important sources of error or variability.

328
00:34:12,760 --> 00:34:20,410
Sorry and what do you think that I mean, if you look at this kind of like numbers, what do you see?

329
00:34:20,440 --> 00:34:25,120
Do you see that those three things are important sources of variability?

330
00:34:26,260 --> 00:34:35,560
No, not right. So it's kind of like I think the highest goes to maybe to both to bring 1% for poly or more females.

331
00:34:36,130 --> 00:34:36,750
And that's it.

332
00:34:36,760 --> 00:34:45,820
I mean, they don't really represent a huge source of really important sources, everything that is between and everything that is with it.

333
00:34:46,090 --> 00:34:50,860
And then you can see that that we think is actually pretty high, right?

334
00:34:50,860 --> 00:34:54,610
So then kind of like the waiting room and they made that this is the error, right?

335
00:34:55,030 --> 00:35:03,850
So this is the one that is kind of like making you not being able to classify people where and understand well that between person variability, right.

336
00:35:04,630 --> 00:35:11,100
So in the end, what we are going to do is that we are going to come up with this simplified model.

337
00:35:11,560 --> 00:35:19,170
So I'm using whatever looking at body, whatever is going to be the result of the population mean.

338
00:35:19,540 --> 00:35:28,210
Right. And then there's going to be variation between subject, right, which is the one that is going to give us a distribution.

339
00:35:28,780 --> 00:35:34,600
And then that is going to be an error. But this is the evaluation with these subjects that they to me, right.

340
00:35:35,080 --> 00:35:39,970
And this is the one that we want to get rid of those. So our model is going to be super simple.

341
00:35:41,680 --> 00:35:50,380
So we are going to use ANOVA and then we will see that now to decompose the variance between the between and everything.

342
00:35:50,440 --> 00:36:00,910
Right. But before doing that, so how many base percentage you think you need to partition the variance?

343
00:36:01,870 --> 00:36:05,230
So what is the minimum number that you need to partition the variance?

344
00:36:22,980 --> 00:36:32,290
I day. I mean, seven, seven could be like an ideal number to have, but you need even less to just partition.

345
00:36:32,300 --> 00:36:36,170
That doesn't mean that the minimum number is the same, but how many?

346
00:36:36,980 --> 00:36:44,440
Why? Three. Three with me? Well, you have your you have your subject in the equation.

347
00:36:44,990 --> 00:36:48,740
So you already have two things. They also can perform the same.

348
00:36:49,680 --> 00:37:01,380
Write it down. One more for the air. Yeah, well, no, actually, you only need to, because, I mean, it was it was a close, but you only need to be.

349
00:37:01,530 --> 00:37:07,679
I mean, with one, you cannot partition anything because you're going to have the within very little the moment you have to

350
00:37:07,680 --> 00:37:14,819
this already you can see that within viability that between you are going to have it even with one right.

351
00:37:14,820 --> 00:37:19,350
Because you have one person, right. So you at least need to to partition the virus.

352
00:37:19,860 --> 00:37:27,390
Okay. That doesn't I'm not saying that two is the ideal number of measures that you have to have in this study.

353
00:37:27,400 --> 00:37:31,830
No, I mean, it would be close to what Kitty said, like seven or even the at least three.

354
00:37:31,840 --> 00:37:38,760
Right. So to have like more, more days, because otherwise you will still have kind of like a lot of error,

355
00:37:38,760 --> 00:37:45,000
but partition the variance all you need to this that what we are going to do in the lab only with do this.

356
00:37:45,570 --> 00:37:49,139
You can do it with more definitely. Or you have five or seven or whatever.

357
00:37:49,140 --> 00:37:52,260
You can still partition the values, but the minimum is two. Okay.

358
00:37:53,530 --> 00:38:04,079
Okay. So, so all you have in our dataset is that we are going to have two repeated measures per person, right.

359
00:38:04,080 --> 00:38:10,170
So for personal one, we will have the one I need to a person do it one and we do unsure.

360
00:38:10,320 --> 00:38:10,590
Right.

361
00:38:10,920 --> 00:38:22,230
And then what we are going to do is to estimate the variance which you know what, and then the variance is the sum of the belief and then waiting.

362
00:38:22,380 --> 00:38:30,750
Right. And they will be made of two things, because one of the things we want to do on top of getting rid of that,

363
00:38:30,750 --> 00:38:37,799
that we will see that we also want to estimate the ratio between the we think person and the between person and

364
00:38:37,800 --> 00:38:44,170
we want to do that because that's going to be a measure of choice to define the variability of our notary,

365
00:38:44,220 --> 00:38:48,300
to calculate how many days we will need to calculate the nutrient accurately.

366
00:38:48,660 --> 00:38:54,570
So the idea is that you have very little with percent variation,

367
00:38:56,040 --> 00:39:04,540
so many things that you basically which may happen with kind of these for example, like calories don't usually go by that much.

368
00:39:05,010 --> 00:39:09,510
So maybe something like this, right? Very small.

369
00:39:09,510 --> 00:39:24,450
We think that you have very kind of like large between of variation differences because you have people who is this case?

370
00:39:24,450 --> 00:39:26,580
A lot of people who don't exercise. Right.

371
00:39:27,150 --> 00:39:36,650
So you think you need you mainly weight to kind of like estimate the calories accurately or you we just a few of you would like.

372
00:39:46,290 --> 00:39:56,020
Think about the other situation. So you have very little personalization, but you have a lot of somebody.

373
00:39:59,340 --> 00:40:07,290
Like, for example, that mathematics you think you need you want more days for one more in-person with your friend in person.

374
00:40:07,650 --> 00:40:11,730
Is that because you have so much control here that you can't really distinguish?

375
00:40:12,090 --> 00:40:16,380
So then you would need the motivation have these would be place, right?

376
00:40:16,890 --> 00:40:24,930
Well, here you have solely on error. We think that kind of like the weekly in person is clearly not right and you need less space.

377
00:40:25,230 --> 00:40:29,670
So that's less important because think about when you design a study,

378
00:40:31,530 --> 00:40:37,410
you most of the time you just want to calculate all the nutrients and you don't think about all the nutrients that you're going to use.

379
00:40:37,680 --> 00:40:41,630
And some new date will be calculating with more accuracy than others.

380
00:40:41,640 --> 00:40:43,280
Because of that, there's you choose it.

381
00:40:43,290 --> 00:40:50,970
You just seven seven may be perfectly fine for your macronutrient your calories and some micro maybe fatty acids so maybe something like that.

382
00:40:51,270 --> 00:40:55,379
But maybe it won't be enough for some very kind of low rate of micronutrients.

383
00:40:55,380 --> 00:40:58,440
You still will have. Not a very accurate measure. Right.

384
00:40:58,650 --> 00:41:04,979
And if you have three even worse, maybe with three, you can have your okay with four calories and this.

385
00:41:04,980 --> 00:41:09,290
But that's it. I mean, the rest of the nutrients will be estimated with less accuracy.

386
00:41:09,390 --> 00:41:18,960
Right. So this is this is why knowing this ratio will help you to know how accurate you are for each.

387
00:41:18,970 --> 00:41:28,500
And okay. So then for NOVA, which is analysis of variance, I'm assuming that you're probably familiar with that.

388
00:41:28,500 --> 00:41:32,280
You know, there are many types of ANOVA, kind of like one way versus two way.

389
00:41:32,280 --> 00:41:36,120
And the because of run the efforts, we are not going to look at that.

390
00:41:36,120 --> 00:41:44,710
We're going to look at the simple ANOVA that you have seen so far, which is the fix, if it's one way and or right or whatever.

391
00:41:45,120 --> 00:41:47,909
And then I like this. Is this coming from the reference book?

392
00:41:47,910 --> 00:41:53,520
I like this figure because this figure is from like 3 to 4% of what I would like to represent.

393
00:41:53,790 --> 00:42:00,600
Like, so this is the example for calories so that you can see so every line is a person, right?

394
00:42:00,960 --> 00:42:04,500
And then this is the population. Me Right.

395
00:42:04,800 --> 00:42:09,270
And then you can see that some people will be at one side of the population,

396
00:42:09,280 --> 00:42:16,660
meaning some people at the other side or even or even kind of like those are very close to the right of both circle of like like six.

397
00:42:16,680 --> 00:42:20,580
Let's assume that you are measuring six measures, but right.

398
00:42:21,210 --> 00:42:30,690
So then you can see here that very small with impacts of ideation but kind of like big, big in person variation.

399
00:42:31,080 --> 00:42:35,340
So then in this situation, kind of like this is a the situation, right?

400
00:42:35,340 --> 00:42:44,280
Because this is when you are going to be able to accurately calculate that not for the population, but here is the other way around.

401
00:42:44,290 --> 00:42:50,189
Here is more like they might actually you have kind of like well having these are you know we think personalization

402
00:42:50,190 --> 00:42:55,860
is actually much higher than this between so some of like you can hardly see anything here it looks like you

403
00:42:55,860 --> 00:43:02,099
split if everyone is eating the same right because of that super high with impression variation actually you

404
00:43:02,100 --> 00:43:08,970
don't you can really distinguish the the real between personal differences because they within are so high like.

405
00:43:12,190 --> 00:43:15,309
Okay. And then this is what they represent.

406
00:43:15,310 --> 00:43:19,420
You can kind of relate to that. Okay. So, listen, I already talk a lot.

407
00:43:20,020 --> 00:43:27,070
So let's start with it with a laugh. So everyone open your document and then open your source.

408
00:43:28,180 --> 00:43:39,330
And I want to go back to, um, but I really hope this is working because I think it was,

409
00:43:40,750 --> 00:43:48,220
I sent a message so they could, um, and they, the licenses that.

410
00:43:55,840 --> 00:44:00,460
Looks like we still have until September 20th.

411
00:44:01,240 --> 00:44:04,360
So I will remind them that they have to expand on like.

412
00:44:09,700 --> 00:44:19,660
Okay. So let me let me open the document, actually, because I don't want you to continue like this for a long.

413
00:44:25,200 --> 00:44:30,540
Okay. So part one, which is the one that we are going to do today, is what they and.

414
00:44:42,160 --> 00:44:48,660
Yeah. So Barwon you have, they have records for two consecutive days from 1980 women.

415
00:44:49,330 --> 00:44:53,200
So they, they are in SAS and they file a variation.

416
00:44:53,230 --> 00:44:56,500
Okay. Don't get confused with evaluation which is best for an x ray.

417
00:44:57,850 --> 00:45:00,160
For each individual there are two rows. Right.

418
00:45:00,430 --> 00:45:10,569
I explained before I'm the first of all individuals I I.D. You can see this is maybe like calories, protein and vitality.

419
00:45:10,570 --> 00:45:14,650
So you have only for the nutrition, calories, protein and vitamin.

420
00:45:16,840 --> 00:45:22,140
And kind of like the second row is the same for the second row, for the same person, but for the second day.

421
00:45:22,150 --> 00:45:27,970
And then you have two more, one for the second Ivy and two more for the third and so on.

422
00:45:28,720 --> 00:45:32,290
So you have 98 by two, right? Okay.

423
00:45:32,290 --> 00:45:45,160
So, so the first thing that we are going to do is to estimate the magnitude of the within person and between person variation for calories,

424
00:45:45,520 --> 00:45:50,320
protein and vitamin D. Right. And they have a lot of kind of like instructions here.

425
00:45:50,980 --> 00:45:57,370
And I'm going to go over those with you ended up in the PowerPoint.

426
00:45:58,480 --> 00:46:07,270
So remember that the model that we are following is this line where we have a neutral, if you want, equals with any population.

427
00:46:07,270 --> 00:46:12,720
Plus there's some variation that we need some evaluation, and then we can set it right.

428
00:46:13,450 --> 00:46:16,120
And this is what they do right now.

429
00:46:18,250 --> 00:46:27,730
When we calculate the variance, what happens is that the volumes of the main population that have variance 60 seconds comprise the population.

430
00:46:28,150 --> 00:46:33,190
So this is zero and this is between social violence and that we think partial bias, right?

431
00:46:33,520 --> 00:46:40,000
So this is the thing that we are going to do now even before going into the code.

432
00:46:40,820 --> 00:46:44,139
Just remember very quickly the library statement, right?

433
00:46:44,140 --> 00:46:54,820
So then you can kind of like you assess, remember that in order to kind of like access your narrative,

434
00:46:54,850 --> 00:47:01,810
you need to specify a live name as they live with a name, whatever name you want to use for your library.

435
00:47:01,990 --> 00:47:07,630
And they pass what they, what they, they don't have a C, you just downloaded the rest to the hard disk.

436
00:47:07,960 --> 00:47:14,350
Then you have to kind of like specify that that's it. So everyone, what I did is that I put it here.

437
00:47:14,650 --> 00:47:18,700
So let me show you, I.

438
00:47:22,570 --> 00:47:37,960
Went to college. I think this should work.

439
00:47:39,850 --> 00:47:46,610
So if I run this. It says my library was successfully assigned.

440
00:47:47,260 --> 00:47:54,160
Right. So then I'm going to make this bigger, and then I can go to my library, which is this one.

441
00:47:54,890 --> 00:48:03,310
Then they can see I have this practice from last week, but still do not believe that this is the variation that I said.

442
00:48:03,580 --> 00:48:11,170
And then you can see this is certainly what I told you, how it should look like we have the I.D., the they, the calories, protein and vitamin D.

443
00:48:11,370 --> 00:48:24,640
Okay. So now that we everyone can read their their assets got going going because the idea is that we're going to do this together.

444
00:48:31,030 --> 00:48:34,920
You couldn't understand. They are. I don't know.

445
00:48:35,140 --> 00:48:38,260
They won't turn on. Oh, but at least you had a lot of good.

446
00:48:38,590 --> 00:48:43,630
So everyone. Is everyone able to work in the computer or working in their laptops?

447
00:48:44,590 --> 00:48:49,150
So those are not working. Is there any way to, like, take this up to your Google Drive?

448
00:48:49,900 --> 00:48:54,340
Yeah. So you have to you have your Google, right?

449
00:48:55,570 --> 00:48:59,370
I mean, how do I link the source here on occasion?

450
00:49:00,910 --> 00:49:04,170
Or or like, how do I. How do I access my Google drive?

451
00:49:04,420 --> 00:49:16,910
That sounds like I'm. So you need to understand the issue, because when you have no one, you have no right to do that.

452
00:49:20,550 --> 00:49:26,900
I have to think about that. Yeah. So maybe now. For now, let's just go back to the basics.

453
00:49:28,620 --> 00:49:32,030
I know, I know.

454
00:49:32,040 --> 00:49:36,780
You said it was a mistake. Yeah, yeah, I know, I know, I know. That must be, like, a way of doing that.

455
00:49:37,080 --> 00:49:40,790
Let me. Let me go through the. Okay.

456
00:49:50,130 --> 00:49:56,840
And what's the deal? Oh, you checking into that?

457
00:49:56,840 --> 00:50:03,940
Do you know that? Right? Yeah. So, you know, they said that you can do.

458
00:50:15,040 --> 00:50:18,980
It's just for this election. I have to.

459
00:50:20,740 --> 00:50:25,490
But I told him to be careful now because today they have a first night.

460
00:50:25,850 --> 00:50:36,560
So everyone has. Everyone is able to access their asset and says, okay, so now let's just move to the next thing.

461
00:50:37,520 --> 00:50:45,320
Okay. So now now that we have this, this is the code for ANOVA.

462
00:50:45,980 --> 00:50:51,059
So basically this group, I know what your benefit was, remember,

463
00:50:51,060 --> 00:50:58,010
in a library and then you had to put the value of the system in because you have to measure.

464
00:50:58,010 --> 00:51:00,770
So these words is kind of like giving you the two measures.

465
00:51:01,190 --> 00:51:05,750
And then the model that you are doing is you have kind of like whatever nutrient distribution,

466
00:51:06,020 --> 00:51:12,470
many calories equal to I because these daily variable defines the subjects and how many measures we have.

467
00:51:13,100 --> 00:51:21,829
Okay, so that's what we are doing. So then just go here for other classes.

468
00:51:21,830 --> 00:51:33,049
I will give you the SAS code. But here since this was kind of like just, you know, not, not a lot, I'm kind of like making you I mean,

469
00:51:33,050 --> 00:51:37,090
one of the things is that they've been the goal helps you to learn it well so.

470
00:51:37,940 --> 00:51:42,259
So you will have it in the in the document and so on, but not in not enough program.

471
00:51:42,260 --> 00:51:48,410
Because if you just have the program and you just run what is written, then you probably one kind of later, right?

472
00:51:48,920 --> 00:51:56,750
So this is variation and you can just follow me as I do it.

473
00:51:56,840 --> 00:52:10,460
Okay. And don't forget to put your run and don't forget to put a semicolon after each kind of like this thing.

474
00:52:10,470 --> 00:52:38,700
Right. So that's that's where you have to take. Yes.

475
00:52:44,460 --> 00:53:07,410
No. To.

476
00:53:08,740 --> 00:53:12,770
You should. Oh.

477
00:53:15,080 --> 00:53:19,830
The whole of the who did and what they did.

478
00:53:19,890 --> 00:53:26,360
Yeah, I found it. It, it took me, you know, not to because the library only refers to the father.

479
00:53:26,450 --> 00:53:31,250
Then you leave it and think I used to. Now you run this issue.

480
00:53:34,030 --> 00:53:43,000
Oh, it's great. Next thing you know. Okay.

481
00:53:43,060 --> 00:53:46,390
So everyone has this code. Now we are going to write.

482
00:53:46,630 --> 00:53:56,100
Okay. So now all we have is like we have for you.

483
00:53:56,310 --> 00:53:59,650
Remember us gives you too much information more than you need.

484
00:54:00,700 --> 00:54:04,090
So this is giving you the all the ideas that you have.

485
00:54:04,510 --> 00:54:11,080
It's always good to check this that you are do not have misuse or you are using this all day, all day.

486
00:54:13,150 --> 00:54:19,930
But really the importance and you can ignore this in this graph, the really important thing here is this.

487
00:54:19,940 --> 00:54:23,200
This is the ANOVA table. Okay.

488
00:54:23,770 --> 00:54:29,080
And then let me let me show you in. We can use this bigger.

489
00:54:32,470 --> 00:54:38,170
So this this is a table that I just copy from says.

490
00:54:38,200 --> 00:54:45,970
Right. And this is what it made. So then you can see here on that for whatever reason that I will never know.

491
00:54:47,980 --> 00:54:52,690
Well, you can know which stuff goes. These models like this is the subject.

492
00:54:53,000 --> 00:54:56,320
Okay, this is a separate kind of line in that way.

493
00:54:57,630 --> 00:55:01,020
And favorite. And this is the it.

494
00:55:01,780 --> 00:55:05,920
And this is a big piece of freedom. Okay. So this is the sum of the split.

495
00:55:06,190 --> 00:55:18,339
Right. And this is they this question. Right. So then what really here we have is that the the model thing is this these

496
00:55:18,340 --> 00:55:23,140
guidelines that basically say somebody implies that we think person variation.

497
00:55:23,650 --> 00:55:26,650
Right. And but the error is definitely there.

498
00:55:26,650 --> 00:55:30,760
We think by some variation ratio here, you already have one of the ones that you need.

499
00:55:31,240 --> 00:55:35,070
Now you need to give the B three, but you have some K here as I'm waiting.

500
00:55:35,080 --> 00:55:39,160
So you just need to do some kind of, like, calculations.

501
00:55:39,310 --> 00:55:48,070
So the idea that, remember, this is how it is. So when you are here, you're we think it's already this number.

502
00:55:48,130 --> 00:55:54,180
So that already gives you that. And they basically remember the previous formula.

503
00:55:54,190 --> 00:56:05,220
You have to kind of like subtract the weakest from this the and then divide the way to locate a K in this situation like this.

504
00:56:05,880 --> 00:56:08,940
Basically, you know, what is the number of days which in this case is true?

505
00:56:09,350 --> 00:56:13,330
Okay. You guys need to think maybe three, which is this one.

506
00:56:13,840 --> 00:56:17,740
So, Strada, we think this is one and believe it and you get this.

507
00:56:18,010 --> 00:56:26,829
Okay, so this is this is your between. So now for every one, for calories, for vitamin A and four, what is the other thing?

508
00:56:26,830 --> 00:56:30,480
A protein you have to do the within and they they re doing okay.

509
00:56:30,880 --> 00:56:35,020
So do it for calories now on your own.

510
00:56:35,020 --> 00:56:42,610
A make sure that you're in the sun and then try protein vitamin A for later if

511
00:56:42,610 --> 00:56:46,360
we have time to do on your own as part of your homework is exactly the same.

512
00:56:46,450 --> 00:56:50,620
Okay. Yes. Could I have help with that?

513
00:56:51,430 --> 00:57:08,730
Yes. What I just tried to focus on during this.

514
00:57:11,390 --> 00:57:15,150
Oh, I. Oh, okay.

515
00:57:15,750 --> 00:57:21,390
Okay. So this is included in this movie, too?

516
00:57:23,190 --> 00:57:26,460
Yeah, because it is.

517
00:57:26,880 --> 00:57:30,910
Okay, well, it's really. Yeah, it's. Here it is again.

518
00:57:31,130 --> 00:57:35,280
Yes. You need to. You just need to use it. Go now.

519
00:57:35,310 --> 00:57:51,420
You know, because I very rarely get used but it in a lot of before I would like to get into the matter of whether you know is related to the C um,

520
00:57:51,660 --> 00:57:55,220
I think I don't know how to that always.

521
00:57:59,230 --> 00:58:12,780
Because. Do they do? Yeah.

522
00:58:13,380 --> 00:58:21,130
Yeah. But I'm not sure what I can do with, you know, with.

523
00:58:22,780 --> 00:58:32,100
So I just think. So you create a whole cycle of.

524
00:58:43,650 --> 00:58:50,410
The levy makers are working to establish and they should issue work like this.

525
00:58:53,300 --> 00:59:02,360
Yeah. What do you think I see? Yeah, I can see some really good scenery before and I'm not sure when you see anytime soon it's like we get it.

526
00:59:02,810 --> 00:59:12,850
We'll have to sort it, like I said this one time so that I can access it, you know, right where I live.

527
00:59:14,450 --> 00:59:17,750
So I want to do something.

528
00:59:22,400 --> 00:59:28,860
It's just not an option. Okay.

529
00:59:28,920 --> 00:59:38,299
Because you can't. You need to create the library. That. Create the narrative.

530
00:59:38,300 --> 00:59:46,920
First you want to work with it.

531
00:59:46,960 --> 00:59:51,670
Not only society can struggle with it. So what would you change?

532
00:59:51,870 --> 00:59:55,420
And I'd be here when it changes later this year. Me So.

533
00:59:56,940 --> 01:00:15,640
You. I get. Yes.

534
01:00:17,860 --> 01:00:25,750
You show these buildings and that you have to have the be that within the that that.

535
01:00:34,250 --> 01:00:40,240
Get. It'll be.

536
01:00:51,180 --> 01:00:57,800
Go to the damage control. And.

537
01:01:05,380 --> 01:01:08,430
Which is to.

538
01:01:16,910 --> 01:01:23,680
So that's a little peculiar to.

539
01:01:32,900 --> 01:01:40,640
Yeah. Fox News.

540
01:02:08,260 --> 01:02:17,660
Thanks very much for the call.

541
01:02:22,680 --> 01:02:24,190
Okay. Well, you are doing that.

542
01:02:24,210 --> 01:02:33,810
I want you to make I want to make sure that you realize that that I this day I actually put stuff in and I'm using their particular tool,

543
01:02:33,810 --> 01:02:37,890
which is criteria for success. And then and this is the points that you get,

544
01:02:37,950 --> 01:02:41,819
it is like everybody can now wait right before the points that you get in each

545
01:02:41,820 --> 01:02:46,469
question and then make sure that you okay with all the things that I'm asking you.

546
01:02:46,470 --> 01:02:52,590
Right, because if you don't and then I will do that points right. So for this particular one, I want you to copy your first goal.

547
01:02:53,040 --> 01:02:56,850
I want you to copy the relevance output, which is the ANOVA table.

548
01:02:57,240 --> 01:03:02,459
I want you to report the within and between person validation for the three nutrients calories protein.

549
01:03:02,460 --> 01:03:06,780
And by the minute, I want you to show your intermediate calculations, okay?

550
01:03:07,080 --> 01:03:15,030
So just don't just kind of like throw me the number without showing the intermediate calculation so that I'm super picky.

551
01:03:15,030 --> 01:03:21,629
But but I, I always tell you this in class before, but then it's just forget.

552
01:03:21,630 --> 01:03:24,450
So then this year I actually incorporated that in the homework.

553
01:03:24,450 --> 01:03:30,840
So then when you read the homework, please make sure that you read everything carefully and then you follow your instructions, I think.

554
01:03:33,940 --> 01:03:40,590
It's. You know what?

555
01:03:46,900 --> 01:03:52,330
Okay. Let me let me continue just one minute. So then we finish this first part and then I will give you a break.

556
01:03:52,390 --> 01:03:55,930
Okay? So and then you can go back. You can go back.

557
01:03:55,930 --> 01:04:01,870
I know we can. The next question is that now that you have a hello hello,

558
01:04:02,710 --> 01:04:09,130
let's let's pay attention just for 2 minutes and then I'll give you a break and then you can continue working on that and I will have you.

559
01:04:09,130 --> 01:04:12,730
But the next question was, you have your between and within.

560
01:04:12,880 --> 01:04:18,190
I want you to calculate the ratios right there within between personal creation for the three notice.

561
01:04:18,190 --> 01:04:21,670
Right. And then I'm asking you, why might they differ?

562
01:04:21,720 --> 01:04:27,010
Right. And you have to answer this later if you have time or as part of your homework.

563
01:04:27,010 --> 01:04:30,130
Okay. So then the second part is there is the ratios, right?

564
01:04:30,700 --> 01:04:38,349
And then the last thing I want to tell you today about the theory is, remember, that was the last thing in the outline.

565
01:04:38,350 --> 01:04:45,999
Is that why do we care about that within percent variation, why we want to calculate it and get rid of that?

566
01:04:46,000 --> 01:04:50,170
Well, because we think person variation will attenuate the strength of the association.

567
01:04:50,170 --> 01:04:54,640
Right. So remember that is making the distributions of the population wider.

568
01:04:55,150 --> 01:04:59,320
So when you don't have this is supposed to be the true intake.

569
01:04:59,710 --> 01:05:05,890
So then this will be like the distribution of one nutrient for control of our cases.

570
01:05:05,890 --> 01:05:10,060
And then you can see that in theory in the this is higher than the control.

571
01:05:10,060 --> 01:05:13,840
So when you think, well, if he had a ratio, you will get like 2.56.

572
01:05:13,840 --> 01:05:20,350
And this is assuming that, you know, the truly situation now when you have within person variation and you get that over,

573
01:05:20,590 --> 01:05:23,799
your distributions are not going to be as nice as here.

574
01:05:23,800 --> 01:05:30,970
We're going to be much wider. So then when you have these wider distributions, what you get is a much lower ratio.

575
01:05:31,000 --> 01:05:34,100
So the the odds ratio is attenuated towards the north like.

576
01:05:34,360 --> 01:05:36,220
And then you can, you have time.

577
01:05:36,280 --> 01:05:42,850
This is from with this book you can actually calculate which you can do is going to calculate the radius and that's how we calculate this thing.

578
01:05:43,210 --> 01:05:50,890
But just keep in mind that bottom line is within person variation and error, kind of like adenoids, the associations right that way.

579
01:05:50,890 --> 01:05:59,410
We want to get rid of that. Okay. So now you can take a break and then we'll go back in 5 minutes and then we will continue with Ella.

580
01:05:59,530 --> 01:06:07,290
Okay. And I don't normally do that.

581
01:06:09,900 --> 01:06:15,190
But the point is, people. Computer.

582
01:06:19,530 --> 01:06:25,510
Mel Gibson. I live in Houston.

583
01:06:26,870 --> 01:06:30,590
Yes. Yes. Do you feel like 10 minutes after lunch?

584
01:06:31,220 --> 01:06:34,370
Yes. I'm struck by the size of all my papers.

585
01:06:35,330 --> 01:06:41,940
Can you help me do that? I just have a few questions if I can get the echo of your afternoon.

586
01:06:41,980 --> 01:06:52,300
Oh, yeah. Okay. We have older Americans in particular.

587
01:06:53,720 --> 01:07:01,459
Yeah, I actually don't condone that.

588
01:07:01,460 --> 01:07:05,970
But it works. And then right now.

589
01:07:09,230 --> 01:07:15,140
Right. This is what we got.

590
01:07:16,380 --> 01:07:19,730
Diplomatic relations and diplomacy help.

591
01:07:23,830 --> 01:07:30,990
Chance. Yeah. I'm suppose you need to change.

592
01:07:33,530 --> 01:07:52,200
Each time I see the manufacturers all over the place, that protein and stuff like that.

593
01:07:52,220 --> 01:07:58,410
No, no, no, it's not. Yes, it has nothing to do with that.

594
01:07:58,760 --> 01:08:02,500
I don't know. I just I don't know.

595
01:08:02,800 --> 01:08:07,790
I don't know. It's not working.

596
01:08:12,140 --> 01:08:19,460
I'll do that for an hour. So everything's fine.

597
01:08:19,870 --> 01:08:30,620
I'm sorry. Yeah, I just went through with.

598
01:08:30,650 --> 01:08:40,150
In between the time. I'm sure I could be wrong.

599
01:08:42,900 --> 01:08:47,540
When you feel that I have to make.

600
01:08:50,210 --> 01:08:54,310
I mean, I both just kind of.

601
01:08:56,900 --> 01:09:03,030
As long as you do that, you might work harder than this one.

602
01:09:13,820 --> 01:09:40,130
But over time, what happened was that either junior high was already here, which is kind of like vocational training and stuff like that.

603
01:09:40,210 --> 01:09:48,200
They just didn't care.

604
01:09:56,100 --> 01:10:12,850
I think. I mean, there are two.

605
01:10:14,680 --> 01:10:23,460
Just last. Yes.

606
01:10:24,380 --> 01:10:28,790
Right now, it looks like a lot of the.

607
01:10:36,040 --> 01:10:43,060
And her family simply doesn't understand what they will attempt to kill her.

608
01:10:45,760 --> 01:10:53,350
But that's what they said was yes, yes, that's where I was.

609
01:10:54,690 --> 01:11:04,810
And. I think that's how some of the people I have gone to.

610
01:11:07,720 --> 01:11:12,030
I just want to believe it's like a dream come true.

611
01:11:12,450 --> 01:11:21,570
Did you hear that?

612
01:11:22,500 --> 01:11:28,970
I feel like I should. When it 20 to.

613
01:11:32,380 --> 01:11:47,800
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

614
01:11:53,490 --> 01:12:01,610
So. I don't know.

615
01:12:03,570 --> 01:12:15,410
I in are. You're here of the.

616
01:12:20,400 --> 01:12:26,690
You know, come.

617
01:12:35,310 --> 01:12:38,970
I think that was.

618
01:12:41,520 --> 01:13:13,760
Yes. And look, you know, I'm not I even things, you know, in which, you know, we still have.

619
01:13:21,920 --> 01:13:38,520
I think for so. So this is the one and those are the other things that you are going to see,

620
01:13:39,060 --> 01:13:51,070
which is I just really know he had great access to the places to do it, you know.

621
01:13:53,570 --> 01:13:57,500
Is that okay?

622
01:13:58,470 --> 01:14:02,870
Oh, yes. You can do a lot more.

623
01:14:04,670 --> 01:14:10,100
You might be able to do it like that.

624
01:14:10,820 --> 01:14:19,830
Yeah, like I have to get out of here now.

625
01:14:26,640 --> 01:14:37,000
She's come to the same place with HIV, and you can see that it's happening.

626
01:14:37,400 --> 01:14:42,240
Look at me, I guess. I'm sure I disagree with you. Like, if I if I.

627
01:14:42,860 --> 01:14:50,520
If I like this. Oh, my God. So I was like, yeah, yeah.

628
01:14:53,700 --> 01:14:57,170
I played around for I don't even know why.

629
01:14:57,280 --> 01:15:13,770
I just to see that. And I guess this doesn't always take some people that your library does feel like it's for good music I really like.

630
01:15:17,280 --> 01:15:34,520
I said, John, so I would have to review it into the library just to let you know there are some things you can look at or not you have to check.

631
01:15:36,680 --> 01:15:45,640
But it's one option to ignore the importance of one another trying to do what is mine anywhere in the world.

632
01:15:45,900 --> 01:15:52,070
I think you're going to have to do that to me. There must be no. I disagree.

633
01:15:53,290 --> 01:16:05,970
Worry about how. Ladies and gentlemen, I that I am not going to.

634
01:16:09,690 --> 01:16:21,330
And that was good for you there for. How is.

635
01:16:27,590 --> 01:16:41,190
We just did a press conference and we know that number and we congratulate.

636
01:16:46,760 --> 01:16:50,900
There's a meeting, so they knew what we were doing is cool.

637
01:16:51,140 --> 01:16:55,510
And then they learn how to do something.

638
01:16:56,450 --> 01:17:00,300
Yeah. I got to get my this. Yeah.

639
01:17:00,610 --> 01:17:05,269
Oh, yeah. So what?

640
01:17:05,270 --> 01:17:10,660
I just. Easy to say. This is the.

641
01:17:13,230 --> 01:17:16,260
Okay. Let's move on, because we still have a lot of things to.

642
01:17:22,050 --> 01:17:27,660
Okay. So now we're going to the. Hello, hello let's go do we're going to the into the second question.

643
01:17:27,660 --> 01:17:31,770
So now we are going to calculate and compare.

644
01:17:32,160 --> 01:17:37,770
Therefore, what I'm going to do is I'm going to show you how to do it and then you can do it on your own because we don't have much time.

645
01:17:37,770 --> 01:17:43,150
And I want to make sure that I explain everything to you and you have you can check the the PowerPoint.

646
01:17:43,560 --> 01:17:51,930
So. So the first thing I'm asking you is to calculate the standard deviation for protein intake if we use the one only.

647
01:17:52,140 --> 01:17:56,130
Right. Remember I was telling you, you're saying only one day is not good, right?

648
01:17:56,150 --> 01:18:02,550
We are doing that on purpose. So you will see that kind of like that standard deviation should be lowered, right?

649
01:18:02,940 --> 01:18:07,320
So we use proper means for that. So then this is the code that you can use.

650
01:18:08,190 --> 01:18:15,700
The variable is protein, protein, and then we use these what is statement to subset only to day one.

651
01:18:15,870 --> 01:18:21,080
Okay. So you run that and then I want to tell you, what do you get?

652
01:18:21,120 --> 01:18:21,989
You can do it later.

653
01:18:21,990 --> 01:18:32,670
Right now, in part B, I'm asking you to calculate the standard deviation for protein intake using the mean of each person's to the intake.

654
01:18:32,790 --> 01:18:37,499
So now we want to use the two days, right? So in order to do that, you run this code.

655
01:18:37,500 --> 01:18:45,360
So basically what you are doing is that first you do the means of every person, right?

656
01:18:45,360 --> 01:18:53,370
So for that, you use this class here and then you are going to output that into our data set where you had the means.

657
01:18:53,580 --> 01:18:59,610
And then in that there I said, that has the means, you are going to do the means, right?

658
01:19:00,030 --> 01:19:06,690
So basically the first thing you do is to give those means.

659
01:19:07,020 --> 01:19:10,350
So you seem to have two or three ratios, but 80, right? So that's the first thing.

660
01:19:11,100 --> 01:19:18,840
This is how the new rate I said will look like. Right. And then now you had those means on that dataset, you calculate the mean.

661
01:19:19,020 --> 01:19:25,380
Okay? And then I'm asking you whether you get one, then you will get it later so you can see what I'm doing, right?

662
01:19:25,650 --> 01:19:33,510
So one day one, and then the other thing is I get first they mean of the one and they two for each person and then they get the mean of the means.

663
01:19:33,900 --> 01:19:37,350
Okay. And then I'm asking you about the standard deviation.

664
01:19:37,710 --> 01:19:44,340
And then in C, I'm asking you compare the previous to a standard deviation and which one is higher and why,

665
01:19:44,940 --> 01:19:52,050
which is kind of like you should expect that they want from day one is higher right now.

666
01:19:53,160 --> 01:19:58,680
What we're going to do and this is a little confusing and that's why I want you to explain and kind of like this again,

667
01:19:58,680 --> 01:20:04,590
I'm going to tell you how to do this for you. All of you should get in this in this homework for then you how to do it.

668
01:20:04,650 --> 01:20:09,780
Okay. So the estimate is through a standard deviation.

669
01:20:09,780 --> 01:20:15,179
I know that. I'm telling you, if they made it through standard deviation means they'd be to impose some variation.

670
01:20:15,180 --> 01:20:18,480
So basically the one that we get rid of the within, right.

671
01:20:18,780 --> 01:20:26,970
So kind of like the one that that is measure and really the the true difference by their reality, right.

672
01:20:27,480 --> 01:20:33,060
So for protein intake, you see the standard deviation from day one only.

673
01:20:34,050 --> 01:20:37,650
And with this calculation, what components of the variation are you trying to remove?

674
01:20:37,650 --> 01:20:47,309
So the idea now is that, okay, I have two days, but if I only have one day, I can still get rid of that with impressive variation using the two days.

675
01:20:47,310 --> 01:20:52,290
Right. And then kind of like get that through a standard deviation.

676
01:20:52,290 --> 01:20:55,049
So that's what I'm going to put into these.

677
01:20:55,050 --> 01:21:01,920
Now in the two previous questions you calculated, observe a standard deviation for using either one or two measures.

678
01:21:02,340 --> 01:21:08,909
Both have within position variation. One will have more than the other right by both have not.

679
01:21:08,910 --> 01:21:16,940
For the calculation of this immediately standard deviation, you're going to use this formula which is equal to the between last year with you.

680
01:21:16,990 --> 01:21:22,290
Okay. And then you can go to the base for the seven and with this work to follow a similar approach.

681
01:21:22,740 --> 01:21:25,500
But then I'm going to show you what we are going to basically.

682
01:21:26,310 --> 01:21:35,910
So you go into that kind of like formula and then you have to take advantage of the ratio you

683
01:21:35,910 --> 01:21:41,460
calculated previously in the question what you've calculated everything which is between ratios,

684
01:21:41,470 --> 01:21:42,600
you should get something like that.

685
01:21:43,200 --> 01:21:51,689
And then what you're able to do here is that you are going to substitute that within or subordination by for 51, maybe three.

686
01:21:51,690 --> 01:21:57,059
Right. So then you have to select it by these race. Okay. So this is just basic algebra.

687
01:21:57,060 --> 01:22:05,250
So when you go back in that formula then and then you're going to use here the standard deviation that you got in there.

688
01:22:05,250 --> 01:22:09,899
One, Okay, don't make the mistake of getting the one for the two.

689
01:22:09,900 --> 01:22:16,800
They stay one okay. So this is your so what I remember from day one and then you're going to do this.

690
01:22:16,920 --> 01:22:20,649
And then the security guys have to do some algebra and then you should get this.

691
01:22:20,650 --> 01:22:26,520
So I'm just giving you the asset, but I want you to kind of like make sure that you understand the process.

692
01:22:27,480 --> 01:22:33,480
If there's anyone who can help, kind of like we don't know what to do, so let me know.

693
01:22:34,170 --> 01:22:42,149
So the idea that and also remember that we are back and forth, back and forth with your standard edition of audience.

694
01:22:42,150 --> 01:22:45,990
Remember that this is standard deviation, the square root of the variance, right?

695
01:22:45,990 --> 01:22:53,469
So then the minutia and in this one half of respondents is like the square root ratio.

696
01:22:53,470 --> 01:22:56,850
Don't, don't get confused with it with the algebra. Okay.

697
01:22:57,300 --> 01:23:05,820
So in, in your in your homework,

698
01:23:05,820 --> 01:23:11,459
I put a lot of kind of like notes and I'm going to have a success on this to make sure that you understand what you are doing.

699
01:23:11,460 --> 01:23:16,350
Okay. So, so when you reach this point.

700
01:23:18,390 --> 01:23:24,660
I'm asking you. Read the note carefully. Everything you need to understand in this question, except this is a hand calculation.

701
01:23:24,660 --> 01:23:29,280
So you're only 34 by one guy. You already have everything you need from previous questions.

702
01:23:29,670 --> 01:23:33,500
Usually standard issue for yourself from day one or right.

703
01:23:33,510 --> 01:23:38,790
Don't take the one from the other. But I'm going to say make it through some the revision using that for now.

704
01:23:38,790 --> 01:23:46,140
Remember, don't get confused with the list and then deletion and the variance because remember that this is the really good one,

705
01:23:46,230 --> 01:23:50,490
this is one of the major squiggles and you will need to do some algebra as I show you.

706
01:23:50,490 --> 01:23:56,340
Right? So you just need to kind of make copy what I know what I need, but I want to make sure that you understand words like, okay.

707
01:23:57,430 --> 01:24:01,620
And then I said, Show me the biggest thing that you actually do.

708
01:24:02,610 --> 01:24:13,170
And I said, Ask the question, right? Because what I must tell you and kind of I already answered in the note of, all right, so the question is,

709
01:24:14,490 --> 01:24:20,370
with this calculation, what components of the variation that you're trying to remove in the note is already given?

710
01:24:20,490 --> 01:24:24,149
Right. So you kind of like that with you, right? Okay.

711
01:24:24,150 --> 01:24:31,950
So that was the most difficult question of this homework and I'm giving you that kind of like all the steps so that you don't get confused.

712
01:24:32,040 --> 01:24:41,490
Okay. So now, now there you see how things change when you use one measure, when you're used to measure,

713
01:24:41,820 --> 01:24:50,070
and when you get rid of the with impersonal variation not you can answer how we use the estimated it through a standard variation.

714
01:24:50,070 --> 01:24:57,600
The ones you just calculated affect the measure of association in an epidemiologic study, which is something they told you before the break.

715
01:24:57,720 --> 01:25:09,750
Okay. And I said this later, and now we are going to move into question three and with this planet, and then you will be able to do these things.

716
01:25:09,750 --> 01:25:14,450
Now a little. We are changing gears now.

717
01:25:14,460 --> 01:25:20,610
We are doing a little something different. We still working with protein, but now for protein intake.

718
01:25:20,610 --> 01:25:28,620
I'm based again on day one only what percent of our study population appear to be consuming less than 50 grams per day.

719
01:25:28,620 --> 01:25:37,740
And remember I explained this to you before going to that you have a lot of days and I'm going to be more like your roommate,

720
01:25:37,930 --> 01:25:40,600
this person that is more kind of like lower.

721
01:25:40,660 --> 01:25:47,700
But this is more likely when you have only one day, your distribution becomes very white and this percentage becomes pretty wide.

722
01:25:47,820 --> 01:25:54,480
Right. So then what you just western what I'm going to do is to first calculate that percentage when you only have one day,

723
01:25:54,840 --> 01:26:00,780
and then we calculate the percentage when you use that through estimated standard deviation that you use,

724
01:26:00,780 --> 01:26:03,810
that should be like the one below the one that is the true index.

725
01:26:04,020 --> 01:26:06,240
And then you will see that is much lower. Right?

726
01:26:06,720 --> 01:26:15,600
So then the idea here is that you do that first for day one and now you recalculate this percent accounting for the degree of within person variation,

727
01:26:15,600 --> 01:26:19,350
which means that basically you are getting rid of within person variation,

728
01:26:19,350 --> 01:26:24,299
you're using the true estimated standard deviation and based on your results,

729
01:26:24,300 --> 01:26:29,760
explain the public health implications of using one measure of dietary intake, which is to measure what you use.

730
01:26:29,760 --> 01:26:35,370
To measure you can get rid of with impersonal variation. When you use only one measure, you get right.

731
01:26:35,550 --> 01:26:40,230
I mean, here we are getting rid with one measurement because we do have to measure, right.

732
01:26:40,260 --> 01:26:41,309
And we can estimate that.

733
01:26:41,310 --> 01:26:47,310
But when you your design only involves one standard deviation, you cannot decompose the variance and you cannot get rid of that.

734
01:26:47,400 --> 01:26:52,170
Right. So so this is kind of like code that you need to use.

735
01:26:52,560 --> 01:26:55,680
So basically first, create a variable and then for the first part,

736
01:26:55,680 --> 01:27:04,950
we create a variable and that is in an environment that is protein, grams of protein, more than 50 or less than 50.

737
01:27:04,950 --> 01:27:12,240
Right? And then you look at properly for day one and then you can see exactly which percentage you get there.

738
01:27:14,900 --> 01:27:22,640
Which is one way you can see that 22% of the population appears to consume less than 50 grams per day.

739
01:27:23,270 --> 01:27:28,309
And now alternatively, you can actually assume and this is what you are going to do for the second part,

740
01:27:28,310 --> 01:27:32,150
but this is less let's ignore this and let's move to the second.

741
01:27:33,380 --> 01:27:37,400
Now, you are going to recalculate this percentage taking into account the within percent variation.

742
01:27:37,410 --> 01:27:45,020
So we are going to do the same as before, but now we're going to use the standard deviation that we calculated in question two, which was 9.56.

743
01:27:45,020 --> 01:27:50,330
Right. And what we are going to do is that we are going to assume, which is what I was displaying here,

744
01:27:51,110 --> 01:27:54,230
that distribution is normal distributed, which is not completely true.

745
01:27:54,800 --> 01:28:04,040
And you are able to calculate, as is called, because remember this, you remember that this is more or less when you have a normal distribution,

746
01:28:04,040 --> 01:28:07,969
you end up with a score and then the reliability assigned to that C score is

747
01:28:07,970 --> 01:28:15,710
actually the percentage of people below they the out in that in that kind of life.

748
01:28:16,220 --> 01:28:19,250
Right. But remember that that is this cause.

749
01:28:19,610 --> 01:28:30,380
So basically. This is how you calculate your score is kind of like your your your your your X value here this 50 right?

750
01:28:30,410 --> 01:28:42,530
Because I want to know below 50. Right. The mean comes from your question, A, does the mean protein intake using day one or using day?

751
01:28:42,560 --> 01:28:46,490
Yeah. And then the true standard deviation now is that 9.56.

752
01:28:46,490 --> 01:28:56,540
Right. And then you get that minus one by T4 and that's associated with a P value of point zero 26, which can be everything is what, 2.6%?

753
01:28:57,380 --> 01:29:10,850
So the whole thing here is that when you only have one day, you estimate that 22% of your population are deficient in protein, right?

754
01:29:11,390 --> 01:29:24,740
Having too little problem when you get rid of the error, you have only two choices, which is kind of like almost three times lower.

755
01:29:24,740 --> 01:29:27,860
Right? So this is not negligible. Right? So these are very important.

756
01:29:28,040 --> 01:29:33,910
So it's kind of like coming from oh my goodness, my population are all I mean, 20% or 22%.

757
01:29:33,920 --> 01:29:37,730
So a lot of people and not having proper protein intake.

758
01:29:38,060 --> 01:29:42,740
And then you realize that not only if I get rid of the error, it's only 2.6.

759
01:29:42,920 --> 01:29:53,719
Right? So we're much better, right? So and then next week we will be doing the measuring diet for you.

760
01:29:53,720 --> 01:29:56,750
And then now you can start doing the homework.

761
01:29:56,750 --> 01:30:00,829
And I will be here. We will be here for the next 20 minutes.

762
01:30:00,830 --> 01:30:03,140
Then you're going to start doing that and ask questions. Okay?

763
01:30:09,480 --> 01:30:15,780
Is anyone is still kind of like a little lost in the beginning, all kind of like the way you able to connect to that.

764
01:30:16,680 --> 01:30:22,270
Okay. Let me see if I can. Okay.

765
01:30:22,280 --> 01:30:53,400
Let me see. Real.
