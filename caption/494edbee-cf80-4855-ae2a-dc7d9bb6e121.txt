1
00:00:01,240 --> 00:00:04,340
Julia I want to ask you.

2
00:00:04,340 --> 00:00:09,415
Your research book is really about the policy and

3
00:00:09,415 --> 00:00:16,238
the interaction between policy its ability to use and out comes.

4
00:00:16,238 --> 00:00:22,629
But when you think about individual fires or hospitals and

5
00:00:22,629 --> 00:00:27,983
networks that are trying to implement systems.

6
00:00:27,983 --> 00:00:33,194
Do you have perspective about what

7
00:00:33,194 --> 00:00:38,110
it is that they need to do first.

8
00:00:38,110 --> 00:00:42,995
There's ideas about how to use determining for the public,

9
00:00:42,995 --> 00:00:47,321
how should systems kind of approach that and saying.

10
00:00:47,321 --> 00:00:52,180
Like what is it that we need to do to use the HR to kinda meet our

11
00:00:52,180 --> 00:00:55,889
goals clinically and perhaps financially?

12
00:00:55,889 --> 00:01:00,500
>> Sure, so I don't think that there is a recipe so to speak.

13
00:01:00,500 --> 00:01:05,102
We're not at a point where we can really distil down, you have to do AB and

14
00:01:05,102 --> 00:01:08,240
C and that's really what's going to work.

15
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:13,198
I mean, I think we at this point have a pretty good understanding of how to do

16
00:01:13,198 --> 00:01:18,157
implementation in the sense of how do we get people to stop writing things on

17
00:01:18,157 --> 00:01:21,890
paper and start entering information into the system.

18
00:01:21,890 --> 00:01:24,340
And that's step one.

19
00:01:24,340 --> 00:01:29,224
But I think the problem is is that that's really a tiny first step in relation

20
00:01:29,224 --> 00:01:33,680
to like what you really then have to do from then on to transform care.

21
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:37,587
And I think one of the risks is that we've sort of sold that first step is like

22
00:01:37,587 --> 00:01:42,020
the big thing and then we haven't really set expect organisational expectations.

23
00:01:42,020 --> 00:01:46,954
And certainly, I mean, the resource piece too, like you have to then be willing to

24
00:01:46,954 --> 00:01:49,647
continue to invest in using the system well.

25
00:01:49,647 --> 00:01:54,691
And I don't think we've just even oriented most organisations to that journey right?

26
00:01:54,691 --> 00:01:57,090
That like they've taken the first step in a much longer journey.

27
00:01:57,090 --> 00:02:01,071
So I think the first thing to do is just to help layout that framework, right?

28
00:02:01,071 --> 00:02:03,306
Like you have the HRs like congratulations and

29
00:02:03,306 --> 00:02:05,840
now let's figure out how to actually improve care.

30
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:10,960
I think that second piece involves a couple of different things.

31
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:15,051
I think the first thing is just making sure you're using the functionality that

32
00:02:15,051 --> 00:02:16,230
exists in the system.

33
00:02:16,230 --> 00:02:19,979
So a lot of organisations don't even have a political decision support turned on.

34
00:02:19,979 --> 00:02:22,947
And that's not to say like turn on everything because we know

35
00:02:22,947 --> 00:02:25,112
that that's bad and it has a lot of fatigue.

36
00:02:25,112 --> 00:02:28,897
But like careful targeting clinical decision support, like the whole reason

37
00:02:28,897 --> 00:02:32,521
you have computers is to be able to use them to support humans in their work.

38
00:02:32,521 --> 00:02:35,531
And so if you're not even using those basic functionalities I think.

39
00:02:35,531 --> 00:02:38,978
So there's like a perhaps a set of low hanging fruit around just making sure that

40
00:02:38,978 --> 00:02:41,840
the functionalities you have available you're using.

41
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:45,411
And I think for a lot of small physician practises that's actually a big thing.

42
00:02:45,411 --> 00:02:48,014
It's not like the technology doesn't do what they say it's going to do and

43
00:02:48,014 --> 00:02:49,900
they don't know what to do to get stuck at that point.

44
00:02:49,900 --> 00:02:53,231
So I think there's sort of a you know a set of activities there.

45
00:02:53,231 --> 00:02:56,832
I think the really big and exciting potential is like okay you now have a huge

46
00:02:56,832 --> 00:02:58,961
amount of data at your fingertips, right?

47
00:02:58,961 --> 00:03:02,530
I mean that's what HRs are repositories of clinical data.

48
00:03:02,530 --> 00:03:06,990
That should be able to help you figure out where you're doing well where you're not.

49
00:03:06,990 --> 00:03:11,701
And it's really opportunity to I think really do performance improvement, right?

50
00:03:11,701 --> 00:03:15,076
In a way where you can track the processes, you can track the outcomes,

51
00:03:15,076 --> 00:03:18,679
you can change the processes and see if the data tell you that you are actually

52
00:03:18,679 --> 00:03:21,140
moving outcomes in the right direction.

53
00:03:21,140 --> 00:03:24,390
So I think when you see IT enabled performance improvement done right.

54
00:03:24,390 --> 00:03:25,141
It is breathtaking.

55
00:03:25,141 --> 00:03:26,690
Like it is really amazing.

56
00:03:26,690 --> 00:03:30,476
You go to Kaiser and you look at how they've improved sepsis care using sort of

57
00:03:30,476 --> 00:03:31,768
IT and data and measures.

58
00:03:31,768 --> 00:03:36,121
And you're like okay but then when you come back well that's Kaiser, right?

59
00:03:36,121 --> 00:03:40,429
That's like and it's a huge amount of resources

60
00:03:40,429 --> 00:03:45,350
to use their EHR data to improve one condition.

61
00:03:45,350 --> 00:03:48,998
And so that's why I think it just gives you a sense of the magnitude of

62
00:03:48,998 --> 00:03:50,606
both what's the potential.

63
00:03:50,606 --> 00:03:54,414
They are but also how hard it's going to be to really optimise use of

64
00:03:54,414 --> 00:03:58,358
these systems and that's why it took a decade in other industries and

65
00:03:58,358 --> 00:04:01,425
why it's gonna take at least a decade in health care.

66
00:04:01,425 --> 00:04:07,084
But I think using the data is like the next big thing that we're gonna figure out

67
00:04:07,084 --> 00:04:12,861
how to do well and move to I mean, it's like what amazon does every day, right?

68
00:04:12,861 --> 00:04:16,392
They look at all the data on how people are interacting with their system and

69
00:04:16,392 --> 00:04:19,939
they figure out what could we do differently to help people buy more books?

70
00:04:19,939 --> 00:04:22,785
And it's a data processing model of running your business and

71
00:04:22,785 --> 00:04:27,140
I think healthcare needs to move to a data processing model of delivering care.

72
00:04:27,140 --> 00:04:33,540
But again, that's neither simple [LAUGH] nor more easy.

73
00:04:33,540 --> 00:04:37,575
>> And so I just want to finish, you've done so

74
00:04:37,575 --> 00:04:43,571
much work in this area and can you think of being involved study and

75
00:04:43,571 --> 00:04:48,808
coming across a finding that just really surprised you,

76
00:04:48,808 --> 00:04:55,051
perhaps has changed your perspective on how you deal with an issue?

77
00:04:56,440 --> 00:04:57,661
>> Really interesting question.

78
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:05,952
And I think for me, the study that would really both surprise me and

79
00:05:05,952 --> 00:05:08,298
make me feel very excited,

80
00:05:08,298 --> 00:05:13,813
was sort of the ability to distil down in a given organisation.

81
00:05:13,813 --> 00:05:19,590
What it takes to turn EHR adoption into improved performance, right?

82
00:05:19,590 --> 00:05:24,446
Like a factor or a set of factors that we said, like when you see these things in

83
00:05:24,446 --> 00:05:29,640
place that is really sort of consistently predicts improved care in any domain.

84
00:05:29,640 --> 00:05:34,543
I think it's that research that really helped us understand why IT was valuable

85
00:05:34,543 --> 00:05:35,940
in other industries.

86
00:05:35,940 --> 00:05:40,727
And I think it's that research that we really need in healthcare to be

87
00:05:40,727 --> 00:05:43,294
able to say it is it is these factors.

88
00:05:43,294 --> 00:05:46,681
It's EHRs plus something that improves performance and

89
00:05:46,681 --> 00:05:49,140
what is that plus something?

90
00:05:49,140 --> 00:05:53,932
And for me I came across a study that really helped me understand that

91
00:05:53,932 --> 00:05:57,820
plus something, I would feel surprised and excited.

92
00:05:57,820 --> 00:05:58,620
>> Yeah, great.

93
00:05:58,620 --> 00:06:00,324
Well thank you so much, Julia.

94
00:06:00,324 --> 00:06:01,631
I appreciate your time.

95
00:06:01,631 --> 00:06:02,361
>> My pleasure. Any time.
