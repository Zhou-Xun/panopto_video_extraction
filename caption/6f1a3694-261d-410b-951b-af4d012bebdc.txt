1
00:00:02,790 --> 00:00:31,750
Think. Does it look like you're still holding out?

2
00:00:32,560 --> 00:00:38,290
I know you can't talk to us.

3
00:00:41,320 --> 00:00:50,320
You know, I had a meeting today with a man.

4
00:00:51,110 --> 00:00:55,270
Who? About your choice?

5
00:01:04,510 --> 00:01:18,850
Yeah, I guess so. And confuses me just because I think I take, like, science and history, like biomedical engineering.

6
00:01:47,660 --> 00:01:55,360
What do you mean?

7
00:01:55,660 --> 00:02:02,180
Explain that one. Well, what can you explain?

8
00:02:02,190 --> 00:02:05,640
I don't understand. Can you just explain why?

9
00:02:07,530 --> 00:02:15,030
Lifestyle factors. I don't know why dietary cholesterol is so.

10
00:02:16,620 --> 00:02:19,140
Why is it two parts of this, right? One is prognostic, Lee.

11
00:02:19,380 --> 00:02:24,540
If people try to reduce their dietary cholesterol and it has no effect on their cholesterol, they will stop.

12
00:02:24,870 --> 00:02:27,750
So, like, from a practical standpoint, that is true.

13
00:02:28,140 --> 00:02:33,420
It is not that it is totally modifiable if by lifestyle factors are still things you can do to change it.

14
00:02:33,420 --> 00:02:44,580
But you.

15
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:46,420
You need all you need to take this.

16
00:04:08,260 --> 00:04:15,380
Wait. Should.

17
00:04:23,790 --> 00:04:30,210
I want to ask a follow up question about this one. What would for be would be increase or decrease the rate of Genesis?

18
00:04:33,030 --> 00:04:39,270
And I think for me, so would adrenaline increase or decrease key to Genesis or do you think it would have no effect?

19
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:55,790
Okay. So if somebody want to justify why they think it would increase not to do it, like those cards have already been depleted.

20
00:04:55,800 --> 00:05:00,070
So you have to get energy to let the people know.

21
00:05:00,130 --> 00:05:03,420
Genesis Pathway. Yeah. So that could be part of it.

22
00:05:03,780 --> 00:05:06,269
Although I'd remember adrenaline is pretty short acting, right?

23
00:05:06,270 --> 00:05:12,210
So the chances are that you're probably isn't a substantial catapult process yet, but it's not incorrect.

24
00:05:12,510 --> 00:05:21,660
I can to. Maybe how long ago? Adrenaline starts to elevate your blood glucose level.

25
00:05:22,140 --> 00:05:28,710
And so you, of course, come to the blood and so you use the various work as fuel, right?

26
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:31,590
Yeah. So that's right. So I guess the key thing would be,

27
00:05:31,590 --> 00:05:38,340
and this is commonly observed during high intensity exercise is that adrenaline's going to promote lipolysis, right?

28
00:05:38,370 --> 00:05:44,340
So those three fatty acids are going to end up going of that, right? So it won't get to the liver and you're not able to catalyze them.

29
00:05:44,670 --> 00:06:22,730
Then you're going to have a lot of. Okay.

30
00:06:22,790 --> 00:06:26,900
This is our first not super clear 95% one way or the other.

31
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:42,000
So I spent a couple of minutes talking to people around here. The more Republican, you know, I just freaked out.

32
00:06:45,860 --> 00:06:57,890
So one of the things that was difficult for me, because we have principally to bring attention to this race,

33
00:06:59,780 --> 00:07:10,370
is something the county wants to see a little coffins transported to the site as a whole.

34
00:07:11,630 --> 00:07:21,040
I understand that that is an important organization for you.

35
00:07:24,350 --> 00:07:30,210
I would have to say that's a quote.

36
00:07:30,300 --> 00:07:39,020
I don't think she's really speaking and you have to take care of it.

37
00:07:39,530 --> 00:07:43,550
Okay. So it sounds like, well, scripts are sort of finished. So can you put in your revised answers?

38
00:08:08,460 --> 00:08:22,280
It's an equal chance.

39
00:08:23,190 --> 00:08:39,120
Chris MATTHEWS. Beginning.

40
00:08:53,350 --> 00:08:57,010
Okay. So here's another one. Maybe we can talk it over with your group for a minute.

41
00:08:57,140 --> 00:09:10,540
And, you know, I don't know if you know.

42
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:35,940
And it's think this is just the highest defamation claims realized Monsanto is supposed to have over LDL cholesterol.

43
00:09:36,990 --> 00:09:40,860
And how are we going to be something else?

44
00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:48,270
Yeah, I think what you are looking for is something that you don't want.

45
00:09:50,920 --> 00:09:56,630
You can always just wait.

46
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:15,040
I mean. I mean, I said back in 2000.

47
00:10:16,430 --> 00:10:21,860
Yeah. Oh, yeah.

48
00:10:25,490 --> 00:10:31,880
Very much so.

49
00:10:32,810 --> 00:10:39,800
You know, because we had a lot to think about it because I just forgot.

50
00:10:40,070 --> 00:10:46,780
Now, look, it's all descriptors. I would have to said there was a lot of loyalty on all sides.

51
00:10:47,300 --> 00:10:53,340
So, Ali, you'll see that.

52
00:10:54,680 --> 00:11:09,290
And everything we know right now is definitely not.

53
00:11:09,290 --> 00:11:16,790
And that is why I don't think you could resubmit your answer here.

54
00:11:17,550 --> 00:11:23,300
I think it's something important since.

55
00:11:29,550 --> 00:11:37,310
Okay. So obviously there's a, you know, see as a subset of the so when we start with the large versus small, so it seems like nobody kept.

56
00:11:38,130 --> 00:11:53,730
So so you want to justify why they're at least not large because they were large with like more they'd have more cholesterol bound.

57
00:11:53,730 --> 00:11:57,000
And then wouldn't that create like a higher LDL seed? That's right.

58
00:11:57,210 --> 00:11:59,820
Yeah. So that would create a higher total.

59
00:11:59,820 --> 00:12:06,930
You'll see if they were if they were like right now, it sounds a little counterintuitive, but like larger particles are better, right?

60
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:14,580
They are less pathogenic. And that goes back to my my example of the chair in trying to throw a B-12 through a small.

61
00:12:15,270 --> 00:12:20,340
Okay. So now the question here between B and C is they both agree that they're very dense.

62
00:12:20,610 --> 00:12:28,520
Is there if they're dense, do they have to always be small or not based on what we sort of.

63
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:43,250
You know, I'm not seeing a lot of confidence answers.

64
00:12:44,510 --> 00:12:49,760
So the answer is they don't necessarily have to be small, but small is like usually associated.

65
00:12:50,390 --> 00:12:54,300
All right. But the key thing is they would have less cholesterol because if you know LDL C,

66
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:58,730
you know how much cholesterol and if you know the number of Applebee's, you know how many parts.

67
00:12:59,270 --> 00:13:03,680
So based on that to immigration, you kind of figure out how much cholesterol is in each and each person.

68
00:13:15,210 --> 00:13:18,990
Oh, yeah. Talk to you guys. Okay.

69
00:13:19,620 --> 00:13:24,840
So when we look at it, Whoopi 100 is not just what's usually associated with LDL.

70
00:13:25,300 --> 00:13:31,140
You're not going to see it will be 100 on HDL or necessarily LDL, so.

71
00:13:31,950 --> 00:13:37,910
Oh, no. Okay. You're doing so well. Okay.

72
00:13:37,940 --> 00:13:46,020
I think you start before you get too excited. Yeah. So basically when you the way you just explained it, it was like, oh, well, it has the April 100.

73
00:13:47,520 --> 00:13:55,229
That means that there's more particles. What other eight how big particles would you see on an LDL?

74
00:13:55,230 --> 00:13:58,440
I guess is my question. Yeah. Okay. Okay.

75
00:13:58,590 --> 00:14:05,950
You're doing great, Roberta. Larry, last word. So every LDL derived particle, every liver sauce particle has one and only one.

76
00:14:06,010 --> 00:14:15,980
It will be 101. That's the best. Okay. So the LDL becoming L, becoming idle, becoming LDL, all of them have exactly one equal B 100 molecules.

77
00:14:15,990 --> 00:14:21,090
So like the higher a po b 100 is like proportionally on.

78
00:14:21,870 --> 00:14:26,700
If everyone at least has one, then everyone has exactly one.

79
00:14:28,140 --> 00:14:32,460
I'm actually there own is it? It is the definition of a particle is it has one of these basket things.

80
00:14:32,700 --> 00:14:35,249
Yeah. No, no, it's a good point. So yeah.

81
00:14:35,250 --> 00:14:42,450
So but that does not tell you about kind of microns, for example, or any color micron particles, because those would be it would be 48.

82
00:14:42,900 --> 00:14:50,410
And it doesn't tell you anything about HDL. Par with HDL particles do not come from the liver, so therefore do not have it will be any.

83
00:14:51,030 --> 00:14:59,280
So then a quick follow up question would be then in terms of like the per 100 indicating that they are smaller,

84
00:15:00,810 --> 00:15:09,060
does that like what other indicator could we use if asked to differentiate between higher and or more dense versus less nuts?

85
00:15:10,350 --> 00:15:15,360
Okay. So the analogy I gave earlier today, so apologize to those who are children today,

86
00:15:15,540 --> 00:15:19,769
is imagine you have a certain amount of water that you're trying to carry from point A to point B, right.

87
00:15:19,770 --> 00:15:25,770
And so that pull amount of water would be the LLC. So that's the amount of cholesterol that is in your LDL fractions.

88
00:15:26,040 --> 00:15:27,479
Now, there's a couple different ways you could do this.

89
00:15:27,480 --> 00:15:34,220
You can have very large pails where you're moving water around or you could have like a lot of small like corners, right?

90
00:15:34,230 --> 00:15:41,430
And so if you had a lot of coffee cups, that would be the analogy to having a lot of it would be one because those conflicts are by definition small.

91
00:15:41,700 --> 00:15:46,079
But you could still move that same amount of cholesterol with large ones, right?

92
00:15:46,080 --> 00:15:49,890
It just depends on what your body makes or what the structure of those particles.

93
00:16:44,340 --> 00:16:56,110
Okay. So I'm going to have to go into groups about this, but I would love to see if it was okay to somebody who picked B.

94
00:16:56,470 --> 00:17:01,420
Want to sort of explain what a key part is, how that has some role in the regulation of the.

95
00:17:19,010 --> 00:17:23,900
All right. Why don't we start with what is the key part of research?

96
00:17:24,260 --> 00:17:38,030
It's the transcription factor. Okay. So generally what these people are sensing is intracellular something.

97
00:17:42,550 --> 00:17:47,050
Fatty acid, right. So it's sensing high levels of intracellular fatty acids.

98
00:17:47,410 --> 00:17:52,690
Okay. So given that information, what would that know? You're saying there's a lot of fatty acids inside the cell.

99
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:55,990
What would that do to like operating like to increase energy?

100
00:18:01,630 --> 00:18:08,930
How about a thumbs up for increase or a thumbs down for decrease? Oh, okay.

101
00:18:09,010 --> 00:18:14,650
It would decrease. Right. Because you would reduce the transport LTL as part of the transport system for getting triglycerides into the cell.

102
00:18:14,860 --> 00:18:18,220
So you already have plenty of fatty acids and so you'd want to decrease the transport.

103
00:18:18,310 --> 00:18:46,860
So that's why he is wrong and C is correct. The peer pressure of the 95 to 5.

104
00:19:01,490 --> 00:19:06,530
The 71 who described what happens to bile salts if they're not infused into the entire site.

105
00:19:09,290 --> 00:19:12,649
Well, that can't be passive. So they can't go through.

106
00:19:12,650 --> 00:19:17,420
So they're just recirculated. Recirculated to or out of the liver.

107
00:19:17,720 --> 00:19:44,760
Recirculated back to liver, biliary ducts. What are you guys getting as an option?

108
00:19:44,760 --> 00:19:51,240
Do you see the picture? And then you type if you type into a textbox in the so is it going to be a word function?

109
00:20:11,570 --> 00:20:17,030
She wants to have figured out how to get the Delta symbol onto their.

110
00:20:24,250 --> 00:20:30,910
I'm just thinking, okay, so it's hard to tell what any individual person's response is given what this work started showing us.

111
00:20:31,210 --> 00:20:42,430
So I guess the one thing and so the answer is, is Delta nine, it's the two things that people could be wrong is remember the Omega nomenclature?

112
00:20:42,430 --> 00:20:45,850
I see a few omega sevens on here. That's not incorrect. That is the name of that fatty acid.

113
00:20:45,850 --> 00:20:56,350
But that's not the delta not in question. Right. So it is omega seven as a 16, but it is that would be the end as an end letter and nomenclature.

114
00:20:56,350 --> 00:21:01,690
Not that delta pharmacology. Does anybody remember what the name of the enzyme that can do this is called?

115
00:21:03,040 --> 00:21:15,879
I can take, say, c 16 and turn it to a C 16 pill tonight it's not a long is such a sterile quality saturates acid one elongates

116
00:21:15,880 --> 00:21:22,090
is the thing that would add another two so that would take a C 60 and explain why it's omega seven.

117
00:21:23,680 --> 00:21:28,560
Why is it omega seven? How you how you get. That's true.

118
00:21:28,990 --> 00:21:35,810
Oh no. The later part is on and too short to explain that.

119
00:21:36,670 --> 00:21:48,650
So one, two, three, four, five, six, seven. Oh question if I go that it is a six, I still think you need to make all that outgoing urine meaning.

120
00:21:49,420 --> 00:21:56,709
Yeah. So technically you want to be specific and actually this is a case C 16 colon one where there is a

121
00:21:56,710 --> 00:22:00,580
trans version of this that is actually like was pretty prominent before they banned trans fats.

122
00:22:00,860 --> 00:22:03,220
I think it's elevated acid. Yeah.

123
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:09,069
So in this case, usually you would want to specify it is less relevant now because trans fats are so much less problematic.

124
00:22:09,070 --> 00:22:13,400
Which is why some.

125
00:22:53,630 --> 00:22:57,130
CV Okay, so this seems a little bit mixed.

126
00:22:57,140 --> 00:23:19,970
So you guys chatted about the people around you familiar to people who will actually be familiar with this topic?

127
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:42,150
I think I think you've made it very clear that I don't think there's a greater responsibility to say that.

128
00:23:42,240 --> 00:24:13,490
I was really pleased to see you on Late Night with the kids and get them to distance themselves for each cultural opportunity so that you can network.

129
00:24:16,440 --> 00:24:55,580
So then I just it's just great to know that you've seen if your group is going to be talking to you here, but in your body, a few for you.

130
00:24:57,020 --> 00:25:01,429
Okay, great. So this could be a bit of a tricky question because there's a few sort of facts you need to know, right?

131
00:25:01,430 --> 00:25:05,149
So you need to know that canola, sunflower, oil have a lot of omega sixes.

132
00:25:05,150 --> 00:25:13,760
You need to know that if you had nature of omega three derived from mercury, would it affect the amount of ala, do you think?

133
00:25:19,910 --> 00:25:23,629
L.A. being the thing that's at the top of the of the big three.

134
00:25:23,630 --> 00:25:26,920
So I see one no and one yes. So one timid note.

135
00:25:26,930 --> 00:25:33,440
So why don't you. So why do you think L.A. would not be changed? Because you can get that from both omega six and omega three.

136
00:25:33,680 --> 00:25:37,430
No know. So L.A. is only in omega three. So that's the precursor.

137
00:25:37,430 --> 00:25:42,200
But that is the original, you're saying?

138
00:25:42,200 --> 00:25:54,500
Yes, it would be. Like I said, it would just because it's race and that's what's in the background.

139
00:25:54,510 --> 00:25:57,950
But you're right. Yeah. So Ehla is the precursor which is going to come with EPA.

140
00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:12,430
EPA and DHS is just water revenue.

141
00:26:12,490 --> 00:26:15,590
So why is it why was it just EPA?

142
00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:21,140
It was D.A. Oh, okay. I think it would be both. So sorry.

143
00:26:21,480 --> 00:26:29,200
Yeah. So then if we had the decrease in EPA would really see it decreased and we would see a decrease in L.A.

144
00:26:29,540 --> 00:26:35,480
Or would we see an increase? Because I mean, so if you had a decrease in the production of EPA,

145
00:26:35,510 --> 00:26:39,890
you would have a slight increase in the amount of ALA because the ALA would not be coming.

146
00:26:40,330 --> 00:26:45,440
We with stay as on small oil. Yeah.

147
00:26:45,440 --> 00:26:49,260
But you know, a lot of that was separatism, but they both have way more actors.

148
00:26:51,500 --> 00:26:53,900
Is there a reason that you just said, you know,

149
00:26:54,350 --> 00:27:01,850
it was also true that this would all be true for DHS on what should be like consider like plant oils in general,

150
00:27:01,850 --> 00:27:05,030
increase their plant oils to things that are higher in omega sixes.

151
00:27:05,030 --> 00:27:10,759
Or is it just specifically like we should know, like canola, sunflower or these kind of sources are?

152
00:27:10,760 --> 00:27:19,669
I don't know if you would need to know it to that much detail. So like as a general rule plant, so why don't we do so as a general rule plant oils?

153
00:27:19,670 --> 00:27:23,510
Because their oils are going to be either movies or movies or have more would be less saturated.

154
00:27:24,140 --> 00:27:25,280
The exception is palm oil.

155
00:27:25,370 --> 00:27:34,070
So everything we have here is going to have an exception of whether or not not all plant based things are more omega six and like a three,

156
00:27:34,190 --> 00:27:42,560
but many of them are. And Safflower is kind of the safflower and some of the other examples of having really high omega six compared to anything.

157
00:27:43,160 --> 00:27:46,160
Yeah. I'm sorry. Can you repeat what you said about that?

158
00:27:46,410 --> 00:27:54,860
KLT How it affects it, yeah. So Ala is the so you're consuming primarily ALA that's the precursor for both DHEA and EPA.

159
00:27:55,160 --> 00:27:57,950
So if you cannot do that conversion that well. So for example,

160
00:27:57,950 --> 00:28:04,040
white males are reported that level of conversion you would imagine that they would have presuming the amount of dietary ALA is the same,

161
00:28:04,040 --> 00:28:07,300
they would have a little more ALA because it's not getting converted to DOJ.

162
00:28:08,370 --> 00:28:37,710
Thank you. It's just.

163
00:29:14,080 --> 00:29:18,700
Yes, that's right. Okay. So I think so.

164
00:29:18,700 --> 00:29:25,180
Three of these, I think to me are totally unambiguous, so comfortably the highest constituency, 24 is the lowest and C, 15.1 is in the middle.

165
00:29:25,750 --> 00:29:29,410
Experimentally, it should be impossible to figure this out because there's no such thing as a C token two.

166
00:29:29,470 --> 00:29:33,430
But I think this is probably where I would where I would guess right where it would be.

167
00:29:33,940 --> 00:29:39,570
But since there's no such thing, I can't. But they would be. I saw the bottom ten times of solving technical difficulties.

168
00:29:40,100 --> 00:30:10,000
But you. Yeah.

169
00:30:44,320 --> 00:30:55,700
Okay. So why don't you just talk this over with the people around this system?

170
00:31:00,110 --> 00:31:17,850
Mr. Turnbull, one of the countries that would like to get this on offense, is you deeply upset that you're able to do that?

171
00:31:18,520 --> 00:31:22,390
You can't make those calls.

172
00:31:24,090 --> 00:31:30,320
I don't like that. It's just not good enough. I've got a remnant of the first place.

173
00:31:31,220 --> 00:31:40,960
So you're interested in the transfer of your interests?

174
00:31:42,700 --> 00:31:51,149
I'm not concerned about, if nothing else, you know, but I feel like, you know,

175
00:31:51,150 --> 00:32:03,160
any kind of life that's not going to be from the top of my mind is likely to stay something like this kind of thing.

176
00:32:03,360 --> 00:32:24,970
But it's going to be very difficult to explain to people that you've got such a partner that can't see anyone else.

177
00:32:25,940 --> 00:32:51,330
So, you know, I feel like if you have triglycerides in your life and your family doesn't get your triglycerides confirmed, that's okay.

178
00:32:51,760 --> 00:32:55,210
You know, that's not working for you.

179
00:32:55,660 --> 00:33:00,340
France for me was muscles and.

180
00:33:02,140 --> 00:33:17,470
Yes. You know, I like that observation of how you know, how you must think.

181
00:33:17,770 --> 00:33:22,299
Okay. It sounds like people have gotten a little more quiet so competently.

182
00:33:22,300 --> 00:33:29,430
And what. Would you think the answer is?

183
00:33:36,060 --> 00:33:48,130
You know, I think it's it's just it's sometimes, you know,

184
00:33:48,140 --> 00:33:55,860
it's just so there was a disease that we talked on really briefly that is kind of related to this.

185
00:33:55,900 --> 00:34:00,790
Doesn't really remember what that was called. That's called micro exocytosis.

186
00:34:01,220 --> 00:34:04,780
Yeah. Yeah. It's called kind of micron retention disease. That's pretty close.

187
00:34:05,710 --> 00:34:11,740
So yeah. So what were some of the phenotypes that would be associated with that other than being lipid related,

188
00:34:11,740 --> 00:34:15,190
which is the answer here if you follow Micron attention disease.

189
00:34:16,180 --> 00:34:22,060
Diarrhea. Yeah. Stat area. Failure to thrive and go to thrive is another good one.

190
00:34:26,610 --> 00:34:35,410
The third one that is related to the nutrition 631 nutrition devices.

191
00:34:36,410 --> 00:34:38,860
Yes, lack of absorption of the fat soluble vitamins.

192
00:34:39,570 --> 00:34:52,650
And what is technically not lack of absorption, you're absorbing it into the parasite you can't get into.

193
00:34:59,620 --> 00:35:44,750
This is the same the same from the previous question. Yes, I do.

194
00:35:45,950 --> 00:36:07,140
We have a and.

195
00:36:24,430 --> 00:36:40,730
It's. And you have to be fluid with this activity.

196
00:36:40,740 --> 00:37:00,590
So we're speaking to game and I'm looking at this table and then I see Chamonix for one thing, I want to mention that lecture based activities,

197
00:37:00,590 --> 00:37:08,870
please try to complete the table and if you are not sure you can put the question mark and then so we can use something to help me.

198
00:37:08,870 --> 00:37:13,160
Tables is mostly from me.

199
00:37:13,460 --> 00:37:47,300
So much patience if you is I don't think you can.

200
00:37:47,330 --> 00:38:04,470
I just sort of thought I can share that actually because we have this really excellent on your what Mr.

201
00:38:04,550 --> 00:38:17,520
keeps repeating also on you and I think that's interesting because what happens is and that's okay you know,

202
00:38:17,660 --> 00:38:26,760
because you want to give me something so you can focus on promise you won't see things reduce consequence.

203
00:38:28,250 --> 00:38:33,260
I think that's what happens.

204
00:38:33,290 --> 00:38:49,680
Internship is to see it for the 33 year old Sherlock Holmes.

205
00:38:52,130 --> 00:39:19,710
Yeah one time I like see how what I do you but what are you he me you know I can only do what I do, you know.

206
00:39:19,730 --> 00:39:24,799
Why is he?

207
00:39:24,800 --> 00:39:32,990
So what do you say?

208
00:39:33,140 --> 00:39:49,190
I mean, what do you think he is to open or elderly age?

209
00:39:51,110 --> 00:39:55,970
You got it. I think I sent it to us.

210
00:39:57,410 --> 00:40:00,670
Oh, I feel.

211
00:40:01,080 --> 00:40:05,300
I think it is the one.

212
00:40:09,380 --> 00:40:33,950
I don't know any of these things you just did this year in 2014.

213
00:40:39,600 --> 00:41:05,630
And he's supposed to be the 10000, yeah.

214
00:41:07,440 --> 00:41:13,459
Yeah, I think he has one started, which is.

215
00:41:13,460 --> 00:41:30,050
And what are you. I'm like, okay, this is your travel is generated all things that you know.

216
00:41:30,530 --> 00:41:38,210
So I guess. But you're right, it's part of transforming the party.

217
00:41:39,200 --> 00:41:42,280
So I think it's okay.

218
00:41:49,880 --> 00:41:55,430
I have learned some lessons learned.

219
00:41:56,900 --> 00:42:12,260
That is why he's not in the shoes of the employees of the.

220
00:42:18,460 --> 00:42:27,040
And subsequently you didn't.

221
00:42:27,120 --> 00:42:55,770
You know, just one thing I would like to see is, you know, those things consistent with cholesterol.

222
00:42:56,280 --> 00:43:03,049
I mean, I don't I don't know.

223
00:43:03,050 --> 00:43:19,720
Some interesting wrinkles that you made in the interview.

224
00:43:20,120 --> 00:43:54,600
You can say it's going to be a major challenge, but here's what it really gets to be sourced from eating.

225
00:43:57,170 --> 00:44:06,380
Well, maybe I can then of my skin transported back under those circumstances.

226
00:44:07,040 --> 00:44:12,560
I don't think that this is a healthy thing.

227
00:44:12,890 --> 00:44:19,760
Well, I mean, I guess think sort of one of the things about I know I'm on the air,

228
00:44:19,790 --> 00:44:35,930
which is the relationship that there's a relationship between myself that is refreshing, I think, in exchange for insurance.

229
00:44:37,100 --> 00:44:48,770
But I don't know how effective it exchanges practice right now.

230
00:44:53,930 --> 00:45:12,889
Yeah, I think it gives you a nice because I think a lot of people like you but it is I think a slight edge on a couple times.

231
00:45:12,890 --> 00:45:18,860
It shows you different things like LDL cholesterol.

232
00:45:20,750 --> 00:46:20,340
You know, I love my liver for 60 years and you know, you're going to decide not to rise up and say, oh, all right, I don't think I'll deal with this.

233
00:46:33,170 --> 00:46:47,440
You know, I don't think makes it through my career goals or I'm kind of like you.

234
00:46:48,800 --> 00:47:10,560
Yeah. It's an audition for something where I think it was, like, really functional what I do.

235
00:47:12,890 --> 00:47:20,080
And there's something I don't know. That's why you're kind of like, you know what I mean?

236
00:47:22,020 --> 00:47:42,830
And like, generated makes it so it's just like, I always wanted to create something like this, and I like all of these basically.

237
00:47:43,250 --> 00:47:47,240
I don't know how we like for the benefit to grow.

238
00:47:48,900 --> 00:47:54,140
Oh, my God.

239
00:47:54,890 --> 00:47:58,660
Oh, really? Yes.

240
00:47:59,090 --> 00:48:09,350
Yes. I think, like everyone's doing everything right now.

241
00:48:09,350 --> 00:48:12,690
Do you think like. Yes.

242
00:48:19,580 --> 00:48:23,050
Yeah, I guess just to hear this.

243
00:48:23,200 --> 00:48:29,000
And it's like someone.

244
00:48:38,750 --> 00:49:19,710
Consider what you see in these groups if you choose to.

245
00:49:26,120 --> 00:49:34,520
Do you think you know, it feels good?

246
00:49:37,480 --> 00:49:56,070
So the question is, you know, where are you?

247
00:49:56,750 --> 00:50:03,250
You know, look into the small business, you know?

248
00:50:04,310 --> 00:50:07,460
Oh, beer. That's great.

249
00:50:08,180 --> 00:50:27,379
I don't know. But I think it's sort of like watching the video and oh, like you are not even you know,

250
00:50:27,380 --> 00:50:39,860
the interesting thing is like I was going to buy his story and I'm just like,

251
00:50:39,980 --> 00:50:53,940
oh, it's like, oh, my dear Mr. like because his motivation to go, Oh, that was supposed to be something.

252
00:50:55,610 --> 00:50:59,959
So I have a certain part time husband.

253
00:50:59,960 --> 00:51:21,170
As I said before, I think it's just like South Texas writers when it came to the Orioles for six months on the street.

254
00:51:22,200 --> 00:51:25,759
Okay. So why don't you guys talk this over for a second with other people around you

255
00:51:25,760 --> 00:51:43,520
when we brought you get the rest of my life here because I was like kind of like,

256
00:51:46,370 --> 00:51:52,219
you know all about that.

257
00:51:52,220 --> 00:51:59,570
But I know. I think we're all friends.

258
00:52:01,160 --> 00:52:08,180
Yeah, my first one. I'm Richard Quest to register.

259
00:52:08,180 --> 00:52:19,220
I've got exactly what I thought to myself for that person.

260
00:52:21,200 --> 00:52:29,930
But you certainly can't get it on the Internet.

261
00:52:31,370 --> 00:52:58,040
Yeah, when I get so stressed, if you want to know exactly what I like about myself.

262
00:53:04,880 --> 00:53:09,190
Yeah, but I mean, you're right.

263
00:53:10,130 --> 00:53:20,720
It is a business because, of course, you know.

264
00:53:21,320 --> 00:53:29,230
So I have no idea what's going on.

265
00:53:29,390 --> 00:53:40,170
It's hardly. Jesus Christ.

266
00:53:45,900 --> 00:53:56,580
Oh, I see.

267
00:53:59,670 --> 00:54:07,050
That's great. Oh, yeah.

268
00:54:15,960 --> 00:54:47,590
Well, I don't have any plans and extremely exciting plans.

269
00:54:47,940 --> 00:54:52,780
Oh, my God. Is not good enough for.

270
00:54:56,700 --> 00:55:00,250
You want to nominate somebody? Okay.

271
00:55:00,780 --> 00:55:05,430
That's all right.

272
00:55:08,700 --> 00:55:11,880
Yeah. I had a question about the APC. One one. The question before.

273
00:55:12,120 --> 00:55:15,320
Is that the same transporter that returns the plant? Sterols?

274
00:55:15,510 --> 00:55:19,260
That's right. There's also it goes both ways. It can transport.

275
00:55:20,670 --> 00:55:23,850
So its primary role is transporting is clearing out plant cells.

276
00:55:25,620 --> 00:55:27,780
So what would be the other way that you're talking about?

277
00:55:27,990 --> 00:55:33,630
Well, in the question, it sounds like if you had low cholesterol, would you increase the expression of that?

278
00:55:34,800 --> 00:55:39,209
Yes. So the because you always increase the cholesterol transporter and the quality

279
00:55:39,210 --> 00:55:44,520
control because you're all then you see what no one's going to let whatever in.

280
00:55:44,940 --> 00:55:56,460
And then you also have to sort of have the ABC five to get you.

281
00:56:26,960 --> 00:56:35,290
It's definitely a. She's.

282
00:56:43,060 --> 00:56:46,030
Okay. That was the last question. We have obviously, this varies a little bit.

283
00:56:46,030 --> 00:56:50,090
It sort of depends on how much reduction of statins there was in an individual person.

284
00:56:52,570 --> 00:57:00,070
Okay. So that's all we have for review prep. We'll hang around here for the next 15 minutes or so if you have any other lingering questions.

285
00:57:00,070 --> 00:57:04,110
But other than that, let us know if you don't like how much further.
