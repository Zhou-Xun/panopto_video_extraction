00:00:06,118 --> 00:00:10,162
Hi everyone, and welcome to another
lecture in our program planning series,

2
00:00:10,162 --> 00:00:12,563
where we will focus on
designing the program.

3
00:00:12,563 --> 00:00:16,590
By this stage of the process, program
planner should have reviewed the current

4
00:00:16,590 --> 00:00:20,260
evidence based on their health issue,
conducted formative research,

5
00:00:20,260 --> 00:00:23,508
identified the relevant stakeholders
in their community, and

6
00:00:23,508 --> 00:00:25,451
written their goals and objectives.

7
00:00:25,451 --> 00:00:29,005
Now, the program planner should
work on designing their program or

8
00:00:29,005 --> 00:00:33,447
intervention to achieve their outcome in
the most effective and efficient manner.

9
00:00:33,447 --> 00:00:35,580
Let's review some key terms.

10
00:00:35,580 --> 00:00:38,490
The intervention refers to
the planned actions that are designed

11
00:00:38,490 --> 00:00:42,480
to prevent disease or injury, or promote
healthy in the priority population.

12
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:46,970
There are two terms that relate
to the size of the intervention.

13
00:00:46,970 --> 00:00:49,460
Multiplicity refers to
the number of components or

14
00:00:49,460 --> 00:00:52,452
activities that make up the intervention.

15
00:00:52,452 --> 00:00:55,560
Research shows that interventions
that include multiple activities

16
00:00:55,560 --> 00:01:00,580
are more likely to make an impact than
interventions that have a single activity.

17
00:01:00,580 --> 00:01:03,899
And dose refers to the number
of program units delivered.

18
00:01:03,899 --> 00:01:07,305
For example, maybe your intervention
involves a nutrition education

19
00:01:07,305 --> 00:01:10,666
campaign for individuals recently
diagnosed with chronic disease.

20
00:01:10,666 --> 00:01:13,191
How many classes will be offered?

21
00:01:13,191 --> 00:01:14,680
Just like with multiplicity,

22
00:01:14,680 --> 00:01:18,575
research shows that interventions that
have a higher dose are more likely to make

23
00:01:18,575 --> 00:01:20,994
an impact than interventions
with a single dose.

24
00:01:20,994 --> 00:01:24,551
There are multiple types of
intervention activities or

25
00:01:24,551 --> 00:01:28,345
strategies that are used in
public health program design.

26
00:01:28,345 --> 00:01:33,690
These include activities related to
health communication, health education,

27
00:01:33,690 --> 00:01:39,579
health policy, environmental change,
behavior modification, community advocacy,

28
00:01:39,579 --> 00:01:43,695
incentives and disincentives and
health status evaluation.

29
00:01:43,695 --> 00:01:47,608
We will now discuss some of the more
widely used strategies in more detail.

30
00:01:47,608 --> 00:01:51,496
Health communication is one of the most
widely used strategies in public health

31
00:01:51,496 --> 00:01:52,376
interventions.

32
00:01:52,376 --> 00:01:55,150
It could be as simple as
giving a brief workshop or

33
00:01:55,150 --> 00:01:58,614
class about a health topic to
a wide-scale media campaign.

34
00:01:58,614 --> 00:02:02,811
Health communication Is commonly
used because of its effectiveness.

35
00:02:02,811 --> 00:02:06,634
For example, it can be used to
raise awareness of a health issue,

36
00:02:06,634 --> 00:02:09,207
change attitudes about a health behavior,

37
00:02:09,207 --> 00:02:13,937
encourage individuals to follow health
recommendations and behavior change,

38
00:02:13,937 --> 00:02:18,690
increase support and demand for social
services, and even build social norms.

39
00:02:18,690 --> 00:02:23,389
One example of a program with a health
communication strategy is the 5 A Day

40
00:02:23,389 --> 00:02:28,611
program, which encouraged individuals to
eat at least five servings of fruits and

41
00:02:28,611 --> 00:02:30,119
vegetables every day.

42
00:02:30,119 --> 00:02:34,491
This program was so successful that
it was adopted in all 50 states.

43
00:02:34,491 --> 00:02:38,082
In Michigan The 5 A Day
program began in 1993, and

44
00:02:38,082 --> 00:02:44,330
included promotion of 5 A Day messages
across 425 grocery stores in the state.

45
00:02:44,330 --> 00:02:49,172
It also distributed educational materials
for preparing nutritious snacks to school

46
00:02:49,172 --> 00:02:52,697
children, and the development
of a healthy eating magazine.

47
00:02:52,697 --> 00:02:56,371
Related to health communication
is health education,

48
00:02:56,371 --> 00:02:59,505
these categories are not
mutually exclusive.

49
00:02:59,505 --> 00:03:02,801
Health education strategies
are similar to health communication,

50
00:03:02,801 --> 00:03:06,154
in that they both communicate
information about health behaviors and

51
00:03:06,154 --> 00:03:09,360
health conditions to a target population.

52
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:13,610
However, health education activities can
be thought of as those are planned and

53
00:03:13,610 --> 00:03:16,940
more formal in the way they are delivered.

54
00:03:16,940 --> 00:03:20,550
These can include classes,
workshops, seminars and more.

55
00:03:20,550 --> 00:03:27,516
And they often include a curriculum,
a sequence of materials, and lesson plans.

56
00:03:27,516 --> 00:03:30,418
For example, SNAP,
the National Food Stamp Program,

57
00:03:30,418 --> 00:03:34,880
provides a variety of nutrition education
activities for individual and families.

58
00:03:34,880 --> 00:03:39,172
In Michigan, there is a program
called PE-Nut, which stands for

59
00:03:39,172 --> 00:03:43,773
Physical Education and Nutrition
Education Working Together to reach

60
00:03:43,773 --> 00:03:47,701
students in low income Michigan
schools and their parents.

61
00:03:47,701 --> 00:03:52,486
PE-Nut teaches children why and how to
make healthy food choices, the importance

62
00:03:52,486 --> 00:03:56,604
of physical activity, and the skills
necessary to be active for life.

63
00:03:56,604 --> 00:03:58,868
PE-Nut that is funded through SNAP.

64
00:03:58,868 --> 00:04:01,252
There are also health policy activities.

65
00:04:01,252 --> 00:04:05,386
These can include regulations,
rules, laws, ordinances and

66
00:04:05,386 --> 00:04:09,530
other policies that are meant
to influence a desired behavior.

67
00:04:09,530 --> 00:04:12,338
Health policy strategies
that are mandated or

68
00:04:12,338 --> 00:04:15,439
regulated that generally
target a wide audience.

69
00:04:15,439 --> 00:04:17,247
There is sometimes controversial,

70
00:04:17,247 --> 00:04:20,582
because it could be perceived as
taking away individual freedoms.

71
00:04:20,582 --> 00:04:27,023
As a result, health policies should be
based on strong scientific evidence.

72
00:04:27,023 --> 00:04:30,892
A recent example of this was the updated
USDA nutrition standards for

73
00:04:30,892 --> 00:04:34,703
school breakfast and
lunch programs that were rolled in 2012.

74
00:04:34,703 --> 00:04:38,982
These standards are part o the Health,
Hunger-Free Kids Act of 2010.

75
00:04:38,982 --> 00:04:44,088
In response to then First Lady
Michelle Obama's Let's Move campaign.

76
00:04:44,088 --> 00:04:47,941
The standards were in line with
the Dietary Guidelines for Americans and

77
00:04:47,941 --> 00:04:51,290
strengthened the available of
healthy foods, while limiting

78
00:04:51,290 --> 00:04:55,036
the intake of sodium, saturated fat,
trans fat and total calories.

79
00:04:55,036 --> 00:04:59,046
As part of these new federal guidelines,
millions of children across the country

80
00:04:59,046 --> 00:05:03,020
consumed school lunches with
improved nutritional content.

81
00:05:03,020 --> 00:05:06,205
And since then, there has been several
studies evaluating the impact of these

82
00:05:06,205 --> 00:05:09,932
standards on children's lunch consumption,
which we'll cover in an upcoming lecture.

83
00:05:09,932 --> 00:05:13,853
There are also environmental change
activities which involve interventions

84
00:05:13,853 --> 00:05:17,129
that target the environment,
however broadly that is defined.

85
00:05:17,129 --> 00:05:21,025
So that could include the physical
environment, the economic environment,

86
00:05:21,025 --> 00:05:25,158
the service environment, the social
environment, the cultural environment and

87
00:05:25,158 --> 00:05:28,010
even the political environment.

88
00:05:28,010 --> 00:05:31,350
Environmental change activities
are similar to health policy activities

89
00:05:31,350 --> 00:05:34,380
because sometimes policy
changes target the environment,

90
00:05:34,380 --> 00:05:37,900
which then change individual behavior.

91
00:05:37,900 --> 00:05:42,770
One example of this is the Healthy Corners
project from DC Central Kitchen.

92
00:05:42,770 --> 00:05:45,590
Healthy Corners works to
improve healthy food access in

93
00:05:45,590 --> 00:05:48,390
food deserts in Washington DC.

94
00:05:48,390 --> 00:05:51,970
Corner stores or convenience stores
are generally thought of as only selling

95
00:05:51,970 --> 00:05:56,530
unhealthy snack foods,
sugary drinks, and alcohol.

96
00:05:56,530 --> 00:06:00,840
But Healthy Corners works with stores to
source fresh produce and healthy snacks.

97
00:06:00,840 --> 00:06:04,630
So the stores can then sell
the produce for below market prices.

98
00:06:04,630 --> 00:06:06,740
It also provides source
of marketing support and

99
00:06:06,740 --> 00:06:11,650
offers nutrition education sessions and
cooking demos to its shoppers.

100
00:06:11,650 --> 00:06:15,090
As a result, Healthy Corner has
changed the food environment in DC for

101
00:06:15,090 --> 00:06:18,610
residents who may not be able
to access a grocery store.

102
00:06:18,610 --> 00:06:22,220
Healthy food is now more prominent,
affordable and accessible.

103
00:06:22,220 --> 00:06:26,956
Now through the Nutrition Education Piece,
residents might be more encouraged to

104
00:06:26,956 --> 00:06:30,880
try new produce or recipes,
all of which serves to increase fruit and

105
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:33,738
vegetable intake among
low income communities.

106
00:06:33,738 --> 00:06:37,485
Here is an example of a program
that included multiple strategies.

107
00:06:37,485 --> 00:06:42,015
CATCH is a large school-based health
intervention that aims to prevent

108
00:06:42,015 --> 00:06:43,359
childhood obesity.

109
00:06:43,359 --> 00:06:45,984
It has been around since the 1980s.

110
00:06:45,984 --> 00:06:50,980
Today, CATCH has been adopted by 10,000
schools and communities in the US, and

111
00:06:50,980 --> 00:06:52,492
in Canada, and Ecuador.

112
00:06:52,492 --> 00:06:55,288
CATCH has different programs for
children at different grade levels.

113
00:06:55,288 --> 00:06:59,710
The CATCH K-5 program
includes four components.

114
00:06:59,710 --> 00:07:04,500
The Eat Smart nutrition program for
school nutrition services staff members,

115
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:07,890
a nutrition curriculum tailored to
each grade ranging from kindergarten

116
00:07:07,890 --> 00:07:12,140
through fifth grade, a physical education
program that's tailored to the age and

117
00:07:12,140 --> 00:07:14,480
developmental stage of the children, and

118
00:07:14,480 --> 00:07:18,170
a family program that includes letters
sent home to parents, talking points for

119
00:07:18,170 --> 00:07:21,585
parents meetings and
a guide to hosting family fun events.

120
00:07:21,585 --> 00:07:26,818
All four components coordinate their
health messages to maximize its impact.

121
00:07:26,818 --> 00:07:30,742
Evaluation of the CATCH K-5 program
has shown that it reduced total fat

122
00:07:30,742 --> 00:07:31,643
consumption and

123
00:07:31,643 --> 00:07:35,966
increased moderate to vigorous physical
activity among school age children.

124
00:07:35,966 --> 00:07:40,712
A study in Texas of predominantly Hispanic
children also found that the CATCH K-5

125
00:07:40,712 --> 00:07:43,357
program slowed the increase
in overweight and

126
00:07:43,357 --> 00:07:46,428
obesity rates that were seen
in the control schools.

127
00:07:46,428 --> 00:07:50,575
This was observed in girls and
boys across all grade levels.

128
00:07:50,575 --> 00:07:53,738
Now that we've seen many successful
examples of interventions,

129
00:07:53,738 --> 00:07:57,469
there are a couple of things left to
consider when designing your own program.

130
00:07:57,469 --> 00:08:00,712
What is the health issue or
behavior that needs to change?

131
00:08:00,712 --> 00:08:03,015
What level of prevention
will the program target?

132
00:08:03,015 --> 00:08:06,261
Will be primary, secondary or tertiary.

133
00:08:06,261 --> 00:08:10,379
Primary intervention refers to intervening
before the health effects occur,

134
00:08:10,379 --> 00:08:12,289
generally in a healthy population.

135
00:08:12,289 --> 00:08:16,768
Secondary prevention involves intervening
before the onset of signs and symptoms,

136
00:08:16,768 --> 00:08:18,085
like cancer screening.

137
00:08:18,085 --> 00:08:22,111
And tertiary prevention involves
intervening after diagnosis already

138
00:08:22,111 --> 00:08:22,644
occurs.

139
00:08:22,644 --> 00:08:26,149
So for example,
designing a nutrition program for

140
00:08:26,149 --> 00:08:29,337
individuals recovering
from a heart attack.

141
00:08:29,337 --> 00:08:32,770
What level of influence will
the intervention be focused on?

142
00:08:32,770 --> 00:08:37,938
Will it be the individual, the community,
the institutions or the government?

143
00:08:37,938 --> 00:08:41,476
What types of intervention strategies
are known to be most effective?

144
00:08:41,476 --> 00:08:45,494
This is when using the best available
scientific evidence is important in

145
00:08:45,494 --> 00:08:50,350
identifying best practices,
best experiences and best processes.

146
00:08:50,350 --> 00:08:53,420
And finally, would it be better
to use a single strategy or

147
00:08:53,420 --> 00:08:55,490
multi strategy intervention?

148
00:08:55,490 --> 00:08:57,030
And from a practically perspective,

149
00:08:57,030 --> 00:09:00,780
what resources are available to help
them implement this intervention?

150
00:09:00,780 --> 00:09:05,022
This last point may help with answering
some of the other questions as well.

151
00:09:05,022 --> 00:09:08,930
I hope you feel better equipped now to
design your public health intervention.

152
00:09:08,930 --> 00:09:11,404
We'll continue to discuss
examples of existing programs in

153
00:09:11,404 --> 00:09:12,478
the remaining lectures.

154
00:09:12,478 --> 00:09:14,421
Thanks for watching.
