1
00:00:09,850 --> 00:00:13,550
In this module, I'm going to talk to
you about controlling water pollution.

2
00:00:13,550 --> 00:00:17,275
There are billions of people on
Earth who have access to safe and

3
00:00:17,275 --> 00:00:20,325
clean drinking water on a routine basis.

4
00:00:20,325 --> 00:00:22,825
Unfortunately, that's not
the whole planets population, but

5
00:00:22,825 --> 00:00:26,965
we're moving in that direction, but you
might ask well, how do we ensure that that

6
00:00:26,965 --> 00:00:31,565
water is safe and clean to drink, or
if we know the water is contaminated.

7
00:00:31,565 --> 00:00:34,955
How do we actually go about
doing that cleaning process?

8
00:00:34,955 --> 00:00:37,510
Let's dive in and see.

9
00:00:37,510 --> 00:00:40,650
I'd like to bring your attention
back to the hierarchy of controls,

10
00:00:40,650 --> 00:00:42,790
which we've discussed in other modules.

11
00:00:42,790 --> 00:00:45,999
We're call here that the top of
the hierarchy of controls is the most

12
00:00:45,999 --> 00:00:48,833
effective going down to the least
effective at the bottom.

13
00:00:48,833 --> 00:00:52,631
So we can think about prioritizing
elimination and then substitution,

14
00:00:52,631 --> 00:00:56,740
followed by engineering controls and
administrative controls, and last and

15
00:00:56,740 --> 00:00:59,250
least personal protective equipment.

16
00:00:59,250 --> 00:01:03,360
Let's apply this hierarchy
to water treatment.

17
00:01:03,360 --> 00:01:04,860
When we talk about elimination,

18
00:01:04,860 --> 00:01:09,640
we actually have a national plan to
eliminate hazards in the water system.

19
00:01:09,640 --> 00:01:13,600
So there's something called the national
pollutant discharge elimination system or

20
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:15,190
NPDES.

21
00:01:15,190 --> 00:01:19,440
This was created in 1972 as a result
of the Clean Water Act, and

22
00:01:19,440 --> 00:01:21,970
basically set up permit
programs that limit

23
00:01:21,970 --> 00:01:26,240
how much pollution can be emitted
into water from point sources.

24
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:27,540
So there's a permitting program,

25
00:01:27,540 --> 00:01:33,220
there's also enforcement that occurs
via monitoring and inspections.

26
00:01:33,220 --> 00:01:36,510
A second layer of the hierarchy of
controls would be substitutions.

27
00:01:36,510 --> 00:01:40,600
So this can involve using alternative
chemicals in industrial processes

28
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:42,790
that have less severe impacts.

29
00:01:42,790 --> 00:01:47,131
In Michigan right now there's
a special focus on perfluoroalkyl and

30
00:01:47,131 --> 00:01:53,230
polyfluproaalkyl substances or PFAS from
industrial and firefighting activities.

31
00:01:53,230 --> 00:01:57,393
And so, there's a move afoot to make
measurements of these materials which

32
00:01:57,393 --> 00:01:59,540
are still commonly used in industry and

33
00:01:59,540 --> 00:02:03,852
to try to identify different chemicals
that might be used to replace the them.

34
00:02:03,852 --> 00:02:06,058
We can also think about
engineering controls and

35
00:02:06,058 --> 00:02:09,600
at this point we can move into
the realm of drinking water treatment.

36
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:13,640
And so here I'm showing a schematic of
a drinking water treatment system and

37
00:02:13,640 --> 00:02:16,090
the various steps that
the water goes through.

38
00:02:16,090 --> 00:02:19,940
So the first box there that you'll
see is Coagulation and Flocculation.

39
00:02:19,940 --> 00:02:24,390
Basically, this means we add a positive
charge to water using chemicals, and

40
00:02:24,390 --> 00:02:29,350
that charge actually causes particles to
buying together into what's called floc

41
00:02:29,350 --> 00:02:32,270
that can then be removed from the water.

42
00:02:32,270 --> 00:02:35,160
The second step or layer is Sedimentation.

43
00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:39,355
So if we let water sit for long enough,
larger and heavier particles will tend to

44
00:02:39,355 --> 00:02:42,438
settle to the bottom of a tank and
they can then be removed.

45
00:02:42,438 --> 00:02:44,950
The third step is Filtration.

46
00:02:44,950 --> 00:02:48,285
Now we pass the water through
a bunch of different filters made of

47
00:02:48,285 --> 00:02:49,584
different materials and

48
00:02:49,584 --> 00:02:54,059
with different pore sizes to try to strain
out basically everything we possibly can.

49
00:02:54,059 --> 00:02:59,036
And then the fourth and final step is
Disinfection where we either add chemicals

50
00:02:59,036 --> 00:03:02,897
or apply ultraviolet light to
kill any remaining parasites or

51
00:03:02,897 --> 00:03:09,350
bacteria or virus before we send it out
to storage and ultimately to consumers.

52
00:03:09,350 --> 00:03:13,070
We can also think about administrative
controls for water contamination.

53
00:03:13,070 --> 00:03:16,160
These would include for
example advisory information.

54
00:03:16,160 --> 00:03:20,560
So the EPA actually mandates that public
water suppliers in the United States

55
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:24,310
provide their customers with
an annual consumer confidence report.

56
00:03:24,310 --> 00:03:27,830
Basically a report on the quality
of local drinking water,

57
00:03:27,830 --> 00:03:32,920
here you can see some pages actually
from our local report in 2018 for

58
00:03:32,920 --> 00:03:36,650
the Ann Arbor drinking water system.

59
00:03:36,650 --> 00:03:40,680
And so, while it's very difficult to read
on these reports, you have the link that

60
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:44,135
you can go to to review the full report,
and what you'll see here is that

61
00:03:44,135 --> 00:03:47,840
the reports include a list of the various
contaminants that are looked for.

62
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:51,580
It will report the levels that
are measured in the drinking water and

63
00:03:51,580 --> 00:03:56,080
it'll compare those to the EPA limit,
so how much is allowed to be there?

64
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:58,820
And then in this case it will
also report the likely source.

65
00:03:58,820 --> 00:04:03,690
So where do we think this chemical or
other contaminant came from?

66
00:04:03,690 --> 00:04:06,300
Moving down to the last level
of the hierarchy of controls,

67
00:04:06,300 --> 00:04:08,330
we can think about personal
protective equipment.

68
00:04:08,330 --> 00:04:13,710
This may not be so intuitive, but we could
think about in home filtration systems or

69
00:04:13,710 --> 00:04:18,550
in home distillation or
reverse osmosis systems, also in home or

70
00:04:18,550 --> 00:04:22,520
at sink disinfection systems, or you
might even think about a personal water

71
00:04:22,520 --> 00:04:26,490
filter for the drinking water bottle that
you carry around with you every day.

72
00:04:26,490 --> 00:04:30,610
Those might be considered forms of PPE.

73
00:04:30,610 --> 00:04:34,530
Now I'd like to talk about two landmark
bits of legislation that really guide how

74
00:04:34,530 --> 00:04:37,070
we deal with water in the United States.

75
00:04:37,070 --> 00:04:40,237
The first is the Clean Water Act
passed in 1972.

76
00:04:40,237 --> 00:04:44,790
And the second is the Safe
Drinking Water Act passed in 1974.

77
00:04:44,790 --> 00:04:47,120
Let's start actually with
the Safe Drinking Water Act.

78
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:50,951
The legislation here applies
to things like Water Systems,

79
00:04:50,951 --> 00:04:54,565
Ground Water, and
Ground Water used as drinking water.

80
00:04:54,565 --> 00:04:58,808
On the right hand side in blue, we can
see the Clean Water Act, this applies to

81
00:04:58,808 --> 00:05:02,466
wastewater treatment plants,
to surface waters that are used for

82
00:05:02,466 --> 00:05:05,557
a variety of purposes, and
to wastewater discharges.

83
00:05:05,557 --> 00:05:08,783
And then in the middle of this Venn
diagram and gray you can see where

84
00:05:08,783 --> 00:05:14,200
these two overlap which is surface water
that's also used as drinking water.

85
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:15,580
A little more on the Clean Water Act,

86
00:05:15,580 --> 00:05:18,520
so here's some text drawn
directly from the act itself.

87
00:05:18,520 --> 00:05:21,970
The objective of this act is to restore
and maintain the chemical, physical,

88
00:05:21,970 --> 00:05:26,090
and biological Integrity
of the Nation's Waters.

89
00:05:26,090 --> 00:05:30,700
This act is administered by the EPA which
actually grants authority to the state.

90
00:05:30,700 --> 00:05:33,921
So the state defines their own
water quality standards for

91
00:05:33,921 --> 00:05:36,758
the water bodies that
are actually in their state.

92
00:05:36,758 --> 00:05:39,456
And those standards are going to
cover things like designated uses,

93
00:05:39,456 --> 00:05:41,400
which we'll talk about in a moment.

94
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:44,535
The criteria that are applied
to ensure that uses protected,

95
00:05:44,535 --> 00:05:49,280
antidegradation policies again designed
to preserve the quality of the water, and

96
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:53,120
then general policies for
enforcement and monitoring.

97
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:56,630
So what sorts of uses can be
designated under the Clean Water Act?

98
00:05:56,630 --> 00:06:00,430
This could include designating water
body for the protection just of Fish and

99
00:06:00,430 --> 00:06:01,700
Wildlife.

100
00:06:01,700 --> 00:06:04,550
It could include a recreation designation.

101
00:06:04,550 --> 00:06:08,640
We can designated for
use as a public water drinking supply, or

102
00:06:08,640 --> 00:06:13,390
finally we could designate it as being
useful for agriculture industry or

103
00:06:13,390 --> 00:06:16,520
navigation of ships and boats.

104
00:06:16,520 --> 00:06:19,110
We also have to worry about
discharges Waste Water and

105
00:06:19,110 --> 00:06:21,300
Sewer treatment under the Clean Water Act.

106
00:06:21,300 --> 00:06:23,196
And so, we think of domestic sewage or

107
00:06:23,196 --> 00:06:27,347
so-called gray water as well as industrial
wastes as things that need to be treated

108
00:06:27,347 --> 00:06:29,858
before they're released
into the environment.

109
00:06:29,858 --> 00:06:35,370
Issues here include organic and inorganic
compounds and also pathogenic microbes.

110
00:06:35,370 --> 00:06:39,820
So in the US, we have about 15,000
sewage treatment facilities that treat

111
00:06:39,820 --> 00:06:43,930
more than 30 billion gallons
of Wastewater every day.

112
00:06:43,930 --> 00:06:49,120
Globally, there's about 79 cubic miles of
Wastewater that are produced every year,

113
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:53,310
that's about half the volume of Lake Erie
right here in the Great Lakes area.

114
00:06:53,310 --> 00:06:56,380
That's 2 million tons of
waste water every day.

115
00:06:56,380 --> 00:06:59,280
And in fact the United Nations
estimates that about 80%

116
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:03,420
of that waste water is released
without being adequately treated.

117
00:07:03,420 --> 00:07:08,461
By 2050, something like 70% of the world's
population is going to live in cities.

118
00:07:08,461 --> 00:07:09,732
In many of those cities,

119
00:07:09,732 --> 00:07:13,365
the wastewater treatment infrastructure
is already inadequate and so

120
00:07:13,365 --> 00:07:16,888
we need to start preparing for
that system to get stressed even more.

121
00:07:16,888 --> 00:07:20,797
Finally as I mentioned,
enforcement of Wastewater does fall under

122
00:07:20,797 --> 00:07:24,785
the Clean Water Act as part of
these antidegradation requirements.

123
00:07:24,785 --> 00:07:27,910
Wastewater I'd like to highlight
is an untapped resource.

124
00:07:27,910 --> 00:07:31,585
So all of that 80% of Wastewater
that's not well treated

125
00:07:31,585 --> 00:07:34,215
is effectively unusable for
other purposes.

126
00:07:34,215 --> 00:07:37,115
But if we were actually to go
about treating that water and

127
00:07:37,115 --> 00:07:39,225
bringing it back up to save standards,

128
00:07:39,225 --> 00:07:44,140
then we've actually expanded the water
resources that are available to us.

129
00:07:44,140 --> 00:07:46,490
What happens to waste
water once it's created?

130
00:07:46,490 --> 00:07:48,260
Well, we have a couple
of different steps here.

131
00:07:48,260 --> 00:07:52,055
So in this relatively complex diagram
that actually water is going to enter

132
00:07:52,055 --> 00:07:55,785
the system in the upper left corner
here and go through pretreatment and

133
00:07:55,785 --> 00:07:58,584
then primary and secondary and
tertiary treatment,

134
00:07:58,584 --> 00:08:00,968
sort of winding its way
through the graphic.

135
00:08:00,968 --> 00:08:04,640
So, wastewater goes through
a pretreatment stage.

136
00:08:04,640 --> 00:08:08,640
And as you can see here that's sort
of the first line of the graphic.

137
00:08:08,640 --> 00:08:13,402
This would involve things like straining
out trash, adding air to let other solids

138
00:08:13,402 --> 00:08:17,092
bubble up to the surface where
they could be skimmed off as scum.

139
00:08:17,092 --> 00:08:20,645
Now when we move into the primary
treatment on kind of the second row of

140
00:08:20,645 --> 00:08:22,860
this image, we have settling occurring.

141
00:08:22,860 --> 00:08:25,634
So the heavier solids again
are going to settle out, and

142
00:08:25,634 --> 00:08:29,655
lighter greases and liquids will rise to
the top and can be skimmed off there.

143
00:08:29,655 --> 00:08:32,660
After primary treatment,
we move to secondary treatment.

144
00:08:32,660 --> 00:08:34,570
And so this involves a couple of things.

145
00:08:34,570 --> 00:08:39,146
We actually add microorganisms to the
water to remove some of the dissolved and

146
00:08:39,146 --> 00:08:41,169
suspended biological material.

147
00:08:41,169 --> 00:08:45,833
And we add oxygen and air to help
the growth of those microorganisms.

148
00:08:45,833 --> 00:08:50,714
Now, many cities including places like
Ann Arbor can have a problem in heavy

149
00:08:50,714 --> 00:08:55,442
rainfall events, because oftentimes
the storm sewer and the sanitary or

150
00:08:55,442 --> 00:08:59,270
sewage sewer lead to the same
wastewater treatment plant.

151
00:08:59,270 --> 00:09:03,150
And so if there's too much water put
into the system, in the upper left

152
00:09:03,150 --> 00:09:07,150
corner of the graph you'll see there's
an overflow situation where in this case

153
00:09:07,150 --> 00:09:11,540
sometimes untreated or not completely
treated sewage can be released,

154
00:09:11,540 --> 00:09:14,430
again due to these
substantial rainfall events.

155
00:09:14,430 --> 00:09:16,340
Finally we can think
about tertiary treatment.

156
00:09:16,340 --> 00:09:20,470
So after we've removed any sludge
from the Wastewater system,

157
00:09:20,470 --> 00:09:25,100
we can dry and burn that off that might
actually be used as fertilizer in fields.

158
00:09:25,100 --> 00:09:28,991
We can burn methane from
remaining decomposing materials,

159
00:09:28,991 --> 00:09:30,821
maybe to create energy, and

160
00:09:30,821 --> 00:09:36,101
then before water leaves the system out of
the the secondary portion of the graph.

161
00:09:36,101 --> 00:09:38,918
We're probably also going to
apply against some chemical and

162
00:09:38,918 --> 00:09:43,720
physical disinfectants just to make
sure it's as clean as possible.

163
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:48,124
So we have many ways that we discharge
waste water into the environment, and so

164
00:09:48,124 --> 00:09:49,872
you can see a list of them here.

165
00:09:49,872 --> 00:09:53,669
So there are things like
municipal water treatment plants,

166
00:09:53,669 --> 00:09:57,616
storm water systems,
concentrated animal feed operations,

167
00:09:57,616 --> 00:10:01,235
shipping industrial processes
in the list goes on.

168
00:10:01,235 --> 00:10:05,485
So all of these types of facilities are
going to be required to obtain a discharge

169
00:10:05,485 --> 00:10:10,620
permit again from the national
pollutant discharge elimination system.

170
00:10:10,620 --> 00:10:14,020
Now let's shift gears and
focus on the Safe Drinking Water Act.

171
00:10:14,020 --> 00:10:18,171
So this is also administered by
the Environmental Protection Agency and

172
00:10:18,171 --> 00:10:22,470
EPA passes federally promulgated
standards for drinking water quality.

173
00:10:22,470 --> 00:10:26,309
So the EPA has National primary
drinking water regulations, and

174
00:10:26,309 --> 00:10:30,371
those regulations set what are called
maximum contaminant levels.

175
00:10:30,371 --> 00:10:32,902
And the EPA also sets out requirements for

176
00:10:32,902 --> 00:10:37,640
regular testing as we saw Ann Arbor
drinking water report earlier.

177
00:10:37,640 --> 00:10:41,680
So the Safe Drinking Water Act only
applies to public drinking water systems,

178
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:46,730
and each state is responsible for
enforcement of systems in their state.

179
00:10:46,730 --> 00:10:49,500
The good news is, most of us have
very clean and safe drinking water,

180
00:10:49,500 --> 00:10:52,190
unfortunately though,
violations are not uncommon.

181
00:10:52,190 --> 00:10:53,876
So as the map displays here,

182
00:10:53,876 --> 00:10:58,446
there's actually more than 27 million
people in the United States who have

183
00:10:58,446 --> 00:11:02,043
a drinking water system with
at least one supply violation.

184
00:11:02,043 --> 00:11:06,374
In other words, they're breaking at least
one of the limits set by the EPA, and

185
00:11:06,374 --> 00:11:10,707
you can see by the coloration on the map
the basically number of people exposed by

186
00:11:10,707 --> 00:11:13,618
area, so
we're quite fortunate here in Michigan and

187
00:11:13,618 --> 00:11:16,035
much of the Midwest to
have few violations.

188
00:11:16,035 --> 00:11:18,285
But if you look at the West Coast and
the Northeast and

189
00:11:18,285 --> 00:11:22,330
parts of the South,
violations are much more common.

190
00:11:22,330 --> 00:11:24,314
I'd like to end on a high note here and

191
00:11:24,314 --> 00:11:28,299
just highlight how important water
treatment has been to Public Health.

192
00:11:28,299 --> 00:11:32,680
And I'll focus here specifically on
our institution of chlorination as

193
00:11:32,680 --> 00:11:34,610
a disinfection process.

194
00:11:34,610 --> 00:11:40,160
So what we're looking at here in
the graphic is between 1900 and 1960,

195
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:45,490
the death rate for typhoid fever in
the United States per 100,000 population.

196
00:11:45,490 --> 00:11:48,841
So you can see we had a death
rate of somewhere around 25 or so

197
00:11:48,841 --> 00:11:51,556
per 100,000 people from typhoid fever.

198
00:11:51,556 --> 00:11:56,689
In the early 1900's, in about 1908
when we instituted chlorination,

199
00:11:56,689 --> 00:12:00,622
we started to see this dramatic
drop in typhoid fever deaths.

200
00:12:00,622 --> 00:12:04,691
And in fact by the point of 1950 or
so, we'd effectively eliminated this

201
00:12:04,691 --> 00:12:08,651
waterborne disease through chlorination
and some other efforts as well.

202
00:12:08,651 --> 00:12:12,924
So as a result of things like chlorination
and filtration, today in developed

203
00:12:12,924 --> 00:12:17,540
in high-income countries, we're not
really worried about waterborne disease.

204
00:12:17,540 --> 00:12:20,832
We worry a lot more about foodborne
illness, but unfortunately,

205
00:12:20,832 --> 00:12:23,065
there are billions of
people on the planet for

206
00:12:23,065 --> 00:12:25,795
whom waterborne illness is
still their primary risk.

207
00:12:25,795 --> 00:12:29,052
And for those folks the good news is,
we know how to fix the problem, but

208
00:12:29,052 --> 00:12:30,191
we have to actually go and

209
00:12:30,191 --> 00:12:35,093
implement these various controls
we've talked about in this module.
