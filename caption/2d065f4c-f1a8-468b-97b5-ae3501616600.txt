1
00:00:02,290 --> 00:00:08,110
Which? You ready to go?

2
00:00:08,110 --> 00:00:15,230
Got it. They matched with my high school color.

3
00:00:15,230 --> 00:02:30,460
Have a great time. Thank you so much. OK, the rest of the class has two minutes to get here.

4
00:02:30,460 --> 00:02:40,900
I think we're going to get started, so this lecture is a continuation of information on gram negative bacteria,

5
00:02:40,900 --> 00:02:47,860
as you all know from the email that I sent out, I hope you all got it, that this lecture is extremely long.

6
00:02:47,860 --> 00:02:54,130
But I felt that last week I had to cancel class because of the snow.

7
00:02:54,130 --> 00:03:01,630
I don't know how much you got in the Lansing or we got a record snowfall of over 13 inches, so we will make do.

8
00:03:01,630 --> 00:03:06,070
And if we don't get done today, we'll carry it on to the next one.

9
00:03:06,070 --> 00:03:13,390
OK. I'm also I think it would benefit everybody in this class to get the study guide earlier, not just right before the test.

10
00:03:13,390 --> 00:03:18,160
So I will try and put that up on Panopto or excuse me, on on on campus.

11
00:03:18,160 --> 00:03:24,100
And if I don't get it all hands on paper, OK?

12
00:03:24,100 --> 00:03:26,980
Anyone have any questions right now?

13
00:03:26,980 --> 00:03:35,920
OK, so one other thing I wanted to mention I understand that you all are concerned about the amount of memorization in this class.

14
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:42,610
There is a lot. I admit it, there is an awful lot. There is no laboratory associated with this class.

15
00:03:42,610 --> 00:03:47,560
So if you had a lab, it would reinforce what you're seeing and what you're hearing.

16
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:51,130
So there is a great deal of material, but I'll tell you,

17
00:03:51,130 --> 00:03:57,580
when you become infection prevention as you go on to your job in public health, you're sitting in a meeting and someone says,

18
00:03:57,580 --> 00:04:01,030
Hey, we've got five, eight, 10,

19
00:04:01,030 --> 00:04:08,080
12 of these specimens from different patients and they're all gram negative bacteria and they're all oxidase positive them in your head.

20
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:11,980
First thing you think is Pseudomonas aeruginosa, OK,

21
00:04:11,980 --> 00:04:19,630
so you do have to use that type of information will certainly come in very useful when

22
00:04:19,630 --> 00:04:26,200
you get your degrees and you go out working on infection prevention and public health.

23
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:34,600
So, yes, there's a lot to memorize. I hope getting the study guide earlier will help with that, and I'm not quite done correcting the test yet.

24
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:40,280
OK. Does that answer your questions? OK, let's get going.

25
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:45,380
So he's going to say to them, we're going to talk about non fermenters,

26
00:04:45,380 --> 00:04:51,800
the fermenters are like the antibacterial AK that we've already gone over, so we're going to talk about some others.

27
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:58,070
So these are very, very important bacteria because they have so many more resistance factors.

28
00:04:58,070 --> 00:05:02,900
So general characteristics, stuff we talk about asking about, for instance, the of homeowners.

29
00:05:02,900 --> 00:05:08,360
And if you can smell that, you get an extra point. Not really. These are non-food fermenters of glucose.

30
00:05:08,360 --> 00:05:14,180
As I said, they're non lactose from Arizona. McConkey. So on McConkey, they're not going to have that yellow colony.

31
00:05:14,180 --> 00:05:21,140
They're going to be kind of pinkish looking, OK. And they are all oxidase negative.

32
00:05:21,140 --> 00:05:32,150
But if we're talking about Pseudomonas and Burkholderia to very quickly cause some very bad diseases, they're also not tremendous of glucose.

33
00:05:32,150 --> 00:05:37,400
They're both non lactose from those on McConkey, but they are oxidase positive.

34
00:05:37,400 --> 00:05:44,320
So this is the first dividing line for this group of bacteria.

35
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:53,860
So let's talk a little bit about epidemiology and school, public health, all of these types of bacteria are widely distributed in nature.

36
00:05:53,860 --> 00:05:58,240
So it's not like you're going to find them in one place and not in another. They're all over the place.

37
00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:03,070
They all really like moist hospital environments.

38
00:06:03,070 --> 00:06:10,090
That's why epidemiology is so very important in the hospital, as well as cleaning every day.

39
00:06:10,090 --> 00:06:13,300
All of them are opportunistic pathogens.

40
00:06:13,300 --> 00:06:22,930
So our sickest patients in the hospital, many of them are immunocompromised, many of them have other diseases going on.

41
00:06:22,930 --> 00:06:27,670
They have a lot of implants, they have a lot of metal or plastic in their bodies.

42
00:06:27,670 --> 00:06:36,700
These are the patients that have the most problem with these organisms. So the very important to nosocomial or hospital acquired infections,

43
00:06:36,700 --> 00:06:48,040
Burkholderia cepacia can colonize and infect the respiratory tract of cystic fibrosis patients now in the state of Michigan.

44
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:53,030
There are only a few hospitals that take in cystic fibrosis patients.

45
00:06:53,030 --> 00:07:00,010
Michigan, I think spectrum over in Grand Rapids and I think is one of the Detroit hospitals that does.

46
00:07:00,010 --> 00:07:06,250
And that's it because there are such complex patients to take care of with with their

47
00:07:06,250 --> 00:07:13,030
respiratory tract that that they're really treated in the centers of Excellence.

48
00:07:13,030 --> 00:07:24,190
And Burkholderia cepacia can be very, very resistant, not just to one or two, but two whole panels and microbial agents.

49
00:07:24,190 --> 00:07:28,900
These organisms are mainly acquired during long or frequent hospitalizations also,

50
00:07:28,900 --> 00:07:37,630
which is why it's so very important that routine cleaning of hospital rooms and hallways and rails when you're walking through the hall,

51
00:07:37,630 --> 00:07:47,430
everything is so very important. So let's talk a little bit about how they cause disease or the pathogenesis.

52
00:07:47,430 --> 00:07:54,660
So we'll start with Acinetobacter and senator from all this. There they have virulence factors, but we don't really know what they are.

53
00:07:54,660 --> 00:08:00,780
They haven't been clarified yet. Acinetobacter can produce lipopolysaccharide capsule,

54
00:08:00,780 --> 00:08:07,460
which you know anything that has a capsule makes it much, much, much more difficult to be fed advised.

55
00:08:07,460 --> 00:08:08,420
OK.

56
00:08:08,420 --> 00:08:18,790
It survives in a dry environment, it can adhere to mucosal epithelium, and it has these little embryos that help it grab on to that mucosal epithelia.

57
00:08:18,790 --> 00:08:30,040
It has both intrinsic and acquired multidrug resistance, so it is very, very difficult to treat and it can affect the risk to tracks.

58
00:08:30,040 --> 00:08:35,020
Soft tissue wound infections cause bloodstream infections, you name it, it can be there.

59
00:08:35,020 --> 00:08:46,780
Now that was asked me to bacteria and stains we talk about Burkholderia is pathogenesis is not really known yet, but people do a lot of work on it.

60
00:08:46,780 --> 00:08:52,660
But because there there's limited patients, they have Burkholderia and they are so sick when they have it because they

61
00:08:52,660 --> 00:08:56,920
have so many other co-morbidities that not it's never really been figured out

62
00:08:56,920 --> 00:09:01,660
other than the comorbidities make them more susceptible to Burkholderia if they

63
00:09:01,660 --> 00:09:05,680
think that it binds to the rest of the nation in cystic fibrosis patients.

64
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:10,210
But it may have other ways to cause disease.

65
00:09:10,210 --> 00:09:17,200
It has a lot of intrinsic resistance to antimicrobial agents, so once again very, very difficult to treat,

66
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:25,330
and it can infect the respiratory tract, soft tissues, lungs and cause bloodstream infections.

67
00:09:25,330 --> 00:09:29,500
It's a good pathogen, but we don't want it around now.

68
00:09:29,500 --> 00:09:37,900
We go to Pseudomonas, and after hearing about those other two groups, Pseudomonas probably might not sound quite so bad, but it is.

69
00:09:37,900 --> 00:09:43,960
The virulence factors here are has exel toxins, so it gives off toxins.

70
00:09:43,960 --> 00:09:53,950
It has proteolytic enzymes that break down tissue and it has alginate and it has a lot of acquired multidrug resistance.

71
00:09:53,950 --> 00:09:57,070
What is it? What are you finding finding in the respiratory tract?

72
00:09:57,070 --> 00:10:02,440
Soft tissue of infections that causes bloodstream infections causes urinary tract infections, you name it.

73
00:10:02,440 --> 00:10:12,340
It's there. And of course, the major pathogen in the Pseudomonas is Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and it really likes water.

74
00:10:12,340 --> 00:10:16,420
So that hot tub that you want to go sit in or the whirlpool,

75
00:10:16,420 --> 00:10:22,030
they clean it well because it really likes tubs, hot tubs and things like that whirlpools,

76
00:10:22,030 --> 00:10:28,840
close contact lens solutions, which is why everybody, including myself, has to have to be very careful with their contact lens solutions.

77
00:10:28,840 --> 00:10:34,870
I think showers respect risk Typekit equipment it likes where there's water.

78
00:10:34,870 --> 00:10:42,640
It is not usually, not almost always, not a member of the normal microbiota of healthy individuals,

79
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:50,380
but in immunocompromised people or immunocompromised people with a pulmonary focus of that immunocompromised.

80
00:10:50,380 --> 00:10:56,050
It's very happy by making them sound like people.

81
00:10:56,050 --> 00:11:05,890
OK, what do we do for lab diagnosis? Because this is the first step in knowing what a patient is infected with and then how to treat the patient?

82
00:11:05,890 --> 00:11:09,730
So specimen collection, it doesn't need anything special for specimen collection.

83
00:11:09,730 --> 00:11:16,930
We've already talked about routine specimen collection. OK, if it's a sputum, get it down to the lab.

84
00:11:16,930 --> 00:11:20,560
You know, have the person bring up a good sputum, not spit.

85
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:27,280
Spit is not sputum. Saliva is not spinner sputum from down in the lungs, a deep lung specimen.

86
00:11:27,280 --> 00:11:33,760
If it's urine, it should go in a urine transport tube directly to the lab and so on.

87
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:39,400
So we do Graham Staines on almost every specimen that comes in, except for blood, blood,

88
00:11:39,400 --> 00:11:44,560
we don't gram stain until it's flagged as positive by the blood culture machine.

89
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:48,020
But what do we see if we have a urine sample? Well, we don't.

90
00:11:48,020 --> 00:11:54,850
Routine Graham sits underneath the virus twice. Best known Acinetobacter is a plump, short cuckold axillary gram.

91
00:11:54,850 --> 00:12:00,430
Negative rods stand a trove of Morris's short straight gram negative rods.

92
00:12:00,430 --> 00:12:07,540
Burkholderia is a little bit longer than a straight gram negative rod, and Pseudomonas is a medium length straight gram negative rise.

93
00:12:07,540 --> 00:12:13,190
And what this tells you is you cannot identify it from gram stain. OK, now you would.

94
00:12:13,190 --> 00:12:18,690
The people in the lab would get into all sorts of trouble if they did that.

95
00:12:18,690 --> 00:12:23,220
Next slide. So but here's what else needed back Baxter looks like on a gram stain.

96
00:12:23,220 --> 00:12:27,330
And you can see how short wish I could do this for you.

97
00:12:27,330 --> 00:12:34,660
You can see how short the are. They actually look like hot side, but those are short gram negative rods.

98
00:12:34,660 --> 00:12:42,590
And here's the trouble for Morrison, it looks maybe a little bit longer, but not that much.

99
00:12:42,590 --> 00:12:47,000
And here a the Sudmalis, so here you can clearly see that they are gram negative while the others were gram negative,

100
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:59,280
but you can clearly see the right shape. And so, OK, now we can do a stay, we can say a gram negative cocksedge gram,

101
00:12:59,280 --> 00:13:04,920
very short gram negative rods, gram negative rods, but that doesn't really identify it for the caregiver.

102
00:13:04,920 --> 00:13:10,440
So we have to grow it in the laboratory or do a molecular type of detection.

103
00:13:10,440 --> 00:13:16,530
So if we're going to grow it, all the organisms that we're talking about today grow very well on blood after they

104
00:13:16,530 --> 00:13:22,980
grow very well on McConkey and on chocolate over those are the bap cap and Mac.

105
00:13:22,980 --> 00:13:29,940
OK. And if we're concerned about Burkholderia, which we are concerned for the patients with cystic fibrosis,

106
00:13:29,940 --> 00:13:36,210
then they have to be on BCR, which is Burkholderia cepacia specific for Burkholderia patients.

107
00:13:36,210 --> 00:13:43,500
It's selective the color of the colony will vary with how the media is formulated, but it is.

108
00:13:43,500 --> 00:13:51,720
If a lab is using a specific type of BCR, they will know what Burkholderia cepacia looks like on that order.

109
00:13:51,720 --> 00:13:54,840
So what about testing on automated systems?

110
00:13:54,840 --> 00:14:01,860
Because that is the way we we rarely in microbiology, we do almost everything automated that we possibly can.

111
00:14:01,860 --> 00:14:09,570
It saves time. It saves technical time. You get the results more rapidly than doing everything by hand.

112
00:14:09,570 --> 00:14:18,930
So identification and susceptibility testing for this particular group of non matters can be problematic.

113
00:14:18,930 --> 00:14:28,110
OK. Some of the isolates may have a capsule, and if the isolate is big and you still have a capsule on it,

114
00:14:28,110 --> 00:14:33,510
it's very difficult for it to be identified on some systems.

115
00:14:33,510 --> 00:14:41,920
Isolates for cystic fibrosis patients are always tested manually because Burkholderia cepacia may not grow very well in the system.

116
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:45,480
OK, but my friend maldi-tof works very, very well.

117
00:14:45,480 --> 00:14:48,780
So once we have isolated colonies,

118
00:14:48,780 --> 00:14:56,310
we can put them on a mite on a maldi-tof stainless steel plate and the appropriate chemicals are dry and zap them in the machine,

119
00:14:56,310 --> 00:15:08,250
and it will tell us if that's it. So it makes that component of identification much more rapid than using routine biochemicals.

120
00:15:08,250 --> 00:15:17,610
But sometimes if there's a capsule, it gets in the way, so we may have to do additional work to get rid of that capsule.

121
00:15:17,610 --> 00:15:24,970
So what about you, we look at the place and we can say, Oh, this is a super mosque, as we all know, it's in Mosul, so but a lot of or McConkey.

122
00:15:24,970 --> 00:15:29,280
But what are these other organisms, including Pseudomonas?

123
00:15:29,280 --> 00:15:33,600
So let's talk about Acinetobacter. The colonies are generally great.

124
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:41,640
They're smaller than the entire colonies. If you were looking at them on a mcconkey plate, they're smaller than the entire colonies will be bigger.

125
00:15:41,640 --> 00:15:43,080
So they're smaller colonies.

126
00:15:43,080 --> 00:15:52,200
They make it look kind of purplish, but not that yellow that we would see with an E coli, a stone's throw from us as large colonies.

127
00:15:52,200 --> 00:15:56,970
And I'm sorry, it stinks. It smells like ammonia.

128
00:15:56,970 --> 00:16:00,900
You can tell when you open up the plate that there's something that's a different smell.

129
00:16:00,900 --> 00:16:05,220
What is that smell? Well, that's ammonia. That's probably a steam trough, a us.

130
00:16:05,220 --> 00:16:09,990
When we get down to Pseudomonas, that's the easiest one to look at on a plate.

131
00:16:09,990 --> 00:16:17,820
Their colonies are kind of greenish and blood bladder. They're kind of green is the flat they're spreading, maybe even hemolytic on blood agar.

132
00:16:17,820 --> 00:16:23,490
So you see a zone of hemolysis around the colony. Sometimes some people say they smell like grapes.

133
00:16:23,490 --> 00:16:28,050
I think that's kind of a stretch, but some people think that they do smell.

134
00:16:28,050 --> 00:16:37,470
I have kind of a group like water, and they do produce a green pigment green pigment called pile CNN.

135
00:16:37,470 --> 00:16:43,130
And that's that green that we might see on on the other place. And then Burkholder is just a smooth gray color.

136
00:16:43,130 --> 00:16:49,760
You can't see anything except we've got growth. We've got identify and see what it is.

137
00:16:49,760 --> 00:17:00,590
So here's Pseudomonas on solid media, and you can see that the colony itself is kind of a darker green here.

138
00:17:00,590 --> 00:17:10,810
I want to get this arranged right now, probably the last lecture of the year. See the darker green of the colony compared to the media.

139
00:17:10,810 --> 00:17:12,430
And here's a Burkholderia on C.

140
00:17:12,430 --> 00:17:23,620
I remember b c our is specific for Burkholderia cepacia contains politics and b type R Caelynn, which is a type of beta lactam and gentamicin.

141
00:17:23,620 --> 00:17:26,810
So it's got three antibiotics in it and it grows very well.

142
00:17:26,810 --> 00:17:35,620
A media that was designed specifically to isolate patients who have cystic fibrosis may have a lot of other bacteria present,

143
00:17:35,620 --> 00:17:40,720
and so we're always concerned about Burkholderia with cystic fibrosis patients in this.

144
00:17:40,720 --> 00:17:49,180
This media really works very, very well. OK, let's go on with ID.

145
00:17:49,180 --> 00:17:55,810
So Acinetobacter and Centro homeless, they're both oxidase negative.

146
00:17:55,810 --> 00:18:04,330
Of course, Pseudomonas is oxidase positive. They don't look like and terex on gram stain colonies may be very short.

147
00:18:04,330 --> 00:18:13,210
They can be identified by an automated systems, by trend micro scan, whatever or by maldi-tof pseudomonas.

148
00:18:13,210 --> 00:18:17,710
I've already shown you colonies of Pseudomonas. They gram status gram negative.

149
00:18:17,710 --> 00:18:25,720
We know that this is oxidase positive. They grow at 42 degrees, which is another way to tell if it's a Pseudomonas aeruginosa.

150
00:18:25,720 --> 00:18:35,020
Every microbe has a 42 degree incubator that you put it plate, a tube of a suspect in there and see if it grows there.

151
00:18:35,020 --> 00:18:44,050
They produce pigment, they oxidize glucose. They can be identified very easily by automated systems and by MALDI-TOF.

152
00:18:44,050 --> 00:18:45,730
And then, of course, Burkholderia.

153
00:18:45,730 --> 00:18:54,280
It's always more problematic to identify Burkholder because once again, they may have a big caps line and it's very difficult to work with it.

154
00:18:54,280 --> 00:19:02,770
You if if you see, if you're glad that you're working and if your institution sees cystic fibrosis patients in the lab that does,

155
00:19:02,770 --> 00:19:06,900
the testing will have to have a specific culture for Burkholderia,

156
00:19:06,900 --> 00:19:15,550
and that can be ordered specifically because you have to do screenings testing of respiratory specimens from all of patients.

157
00:19:15,550 --> 00:19:21,370
They all get put on PCR designed just for Burkholderia cepacia, and they can be identified by MALDI-TOF.

158
00:19:21,370 --> 00:19:27,250
So even though we think we know what it is on an on a plate, we still have to have confirmatory identification,

159
00:19:27,250 --> 00:19:32,170
either by biochemical testing or by MALDI-TOF or we can do molecular.

160
00:19:32,170 --> 00:19:40,030
But if we do molecular and we don't have a culture, we can't do any susceptibility testing.

161
00:19:40,030 --> 00:19:43,810
So, well, look, susceptibility, testing and therapy.

162
00:19:43,810 --> 00:19:52,900
First one is asking you a backdoor, a backdoor has gotten much, much, much more resistant over the last 10 or 15 years.

163
00:19:52,900 --> 00:19:58,000
Definitely do susceptibility testing if it's clinically significant. So how would you know if it's clinically significant?

164
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:03,680
You look at an on your plate. Is it the predominant growth on the plate?

165
00:20:03,680 --> 00:20:07,120
You look at the Graham saying, is that the predominant bacterial type?

166
00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:12,910
You can't call it Acinetobacter from the ground grandstand. And you say, Hey, there's a lot of really short gram negative rods here.

167
00:20:12,910 --> 00:20:18,460
And then you look at the plate and you say, Oh, it looks like a bastion of active.

168
00:20:18,460 --> 00:20:26,080
So we have resisted antimicrobial resistance in many different classes of antibiotics,

169
00:20:26,080 --> 00:20:31,670
so susceptibility testing is very, very, very important because the results will guide the therapy.

170
00:20:31,670 --> 00:20:39,280
You can't just automatically put the patient under my skin or ampicillin or fluoxetine or something like that without a susceptibility test.

171
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:46,780
And you can do either this diffusion, which is Kirby Bauer or a minimum inhibitory concentration test if both of them work fine.

172
00:20:46,780 --> 00:20:55,750
And then once you have those results in their release, then the physicians know what to treat the patient with and as future epidemiologists.

173
00:20:55,750 --> 00:20:59,440
You don't want a well, you don't want any outbreaks in any institution.

174
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:02,560
People want transmission of organisms in any institution.

175
00:21:02,560 --> 00:21:11,930
But if it has a specific antimicrobial resistance pattern that can help you a lot because you know where it's where it's spread,

176
00:21:11,930 --> 00:21:16,810
OK, and then you can do more investigation. See how it got there. You know who didn't wash their hands?

177
00:21:16,810 --> 00:21:25,270
What happened? OK? Senator Heffernan once again test if it's clinically resistant, is it seen on the gram sting?

178
00:21:25,270 --> 00:21:29,830
Is it growing on the places that the predominant organism on the plates and so on?

179
00:21:29,830 --> 00:21:40,210
It can be even more resistant, so therapy is is can be limited, and the in vitro results for beta lactam drugs are really unreliable.

180
00:21:40,210 --> 00:21:49,360
So you can't use those. And first and foremost, Bactrim or trimethoprim itself is that is the drug of choice,

181
00:21:49,360 --> 00:22:00,230
unless a patient can't take it, they can't take it, then there are problems with therapy for those patients.

182
00:22:00,230 --> 00:22:06,170
Next week, Anderson Morris and once again, susceptibility guides the therapy.

183
00:22:06,170 --> 00:22:17,180
It can be very, very resistant. Sometimes you see some that are not resistant, although that's unusual, but that doesn't happen enough.

184
00:22:17,180 --> 00:22:25,700
Generally, they're treated with A. Pseudomonas beta lactamase, and it may take either side because they become resistant so rapidly.

185
00:22:25,700 --> 00:22:30,080
OK. And then, of course, Burkholderia Typekit burchell.

186
00:22:30,080 --> 00:22:33,650
There's fascia. Once again, you need susceptibility testing.

187
00:22:33,650 --> 00:22:38,510
If the lab that you're associated with your institution doesn't do it for these organisms,

188
00:22:38,510 --> 00:22:46,310
there will have a send out to Mayo or lab for or one of the big commercial labs,

189
00:22:46,310 --> 00:22:53,620
which will be able to provide the information generally to the patients treated with preparazione.

190
00:22:53,620 --> 00:22:59,150
So tragedy mimi and empanel but rarely is the organism eradicated.

191
00:22:59,150 --> 00:23:12,020
It can't be kept under control. But with our cystic fibrosis patients, it's very, very difficult to get rid of it.

192
00:23:12,020 --> 00:23:17,720
So here's an exam type question, Anon, for many gram negative rods, ox positive, green,

193
00:23:17,720 --> 00:23:24,530
pigmented for as well 42 have been isolated from our respiratory specimen from cystic fibrosis patients.

194
00:23:24,530 --> 00:23:29,840
Should susceptibility testing be performed, why or why not? This would be a short answer.

195
00:23:29,840 --> 00:23:34,880
There's no multiple yes here. Do we need to do susceptibility testing?

196
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:38,720
Anybody say no that we need to do it.

197
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:47,170
We definitely need to do susceptibility testing. What are you thinking it is?

198
00:23:47,170 --> 00:23:51,690
Bingo. OK.

199
00:23:51,690 --> 00:23:56,710
Let's go on to some other Gram negatives. The next group is Campylobacter, Legionella and Bartonella.

200
00:23:56,710 --> 00:24:00,690
Fortunate we don't see much Bartonella here in Michigan, but we have seen it.

201
00:24:00,690 --> 00:24:08,880
We see the others a lot. So Campylobacter, there are different species in the genus Campylobacter.

202
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:14,490
We've got Campylobacter coli two, Judy Subspecies two Judy jejuni, subspecies doily.

203
00:24:14,490 --> 00:24:19,780
I am fetus subspecies fetus most common one and here is for humans.

204
00:24:19,780 --> 00:24:24,420
In fact, is two Judy subspecies jejuni.

205
00:24:24,420 --> 00:24:34,630
We see the others, but not as much as the junior suspicious gene and the the slide shows in different sources by which a person can acquire.

206
00:24:34,630 --> 00:24:44,810
And it's not just the live animals, but no lack of handwashing, not cooking foods properly and so on.

207
00:24:44,810 --> 00:24:51,200
And then the human diseases by the chemical batteries, pretty much they all cause gastroenteritis.

208
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:58,820
Most of them have sepsis. But jejuni can also cause meningitis in prior crisis.

209
00:24:58,820 --> 00:25:07,820
So a fetus is known for not only sepsis, sepsis and gastroenteritis, but abortion and meningitis.

210
00:25:07,820 --> 00:25:12,290
So none of them are easy. None of them.

211
00:25:12,290 --> 00:25:16,920
You can't just blow off any of them. They are problematic.

212
00:25:16,920 --> 00:25:25,020
So characteristics of Campylobacter species, so mostly disease is caused by Campylobacter coli and fetus,

213
00:25:25,020 --> 00:25:33,960
they cause the most human disease transmitted through contaminated food, milk and water.

214
00:25:33,960 --> 00:25:38,880
And with that, contaminated food is hand washing and washing down other surfaces.

215
00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:46,620
Also, it does not multiply in the food. It's transmitted in the food from one source to a new source.

216
00:25:46,620 --> 00:25:54,390
OK. There is. Can't by coughing on somebody you can't generally give them, can't pull back.

217
00:25:54,390 --> 00:26:03,240
So the human to human transmission doesn't happen very often. Food, milk or water.

218
00:26:03,240 --> 00:26:08,710
So when do we see careful doctor in the United States late summer or early fall?

219
00:26:08,710 --> 00:26:12,570
OK, people are out picnicking. They want to get the last event in there, you know?

220
00:26:12,570 --> 00:26:18,490
Well, let's go swimming one more time, whatever. It's late summer or early fall.

221
00:26:18,490 --> 00:26:25,830
Generally, because bacterial gastroenteritis, that's most common disease that they cause diarrhea.

222
00:26:25,830 --> 00:26:32,850
The GI disease is self-limiting, but there's nothing that says it will be limited in two days versus 10 days.

223
00:26:32,850 --> 00:26:42,000
OK, so it can be very, very bad. You can have post infectious complications in up to the most important one is Guillain-Barre syndrome.

224
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:57,110
OK, neurologic symptoms. So mostly this does not happen with the NRA because it's diagnosed and is treated appropriately, but it can happen.

225
00:26:57,110 --> 00:27:04,220
So what do we do for love? Well, we got to get a specimen into the lab. And what you see here is a pair of pants and cultures.

226
00:27:04,220 --> 00:27:11,480
See it as it is. And that is a stool container and it has transport media in it.

227
00:27:11,480 --> 00:27:19,370
OK, so once the patient provides a specimen, probably into a bedpan or something,

228
00:27:19,370 --> 00:27:29,630
then because you don't try and hold it while somebody is going take a swab or generally a swab might be in here, might have a little spoon inside.

229
00:27:29,630 --> 00:27:31,520
Some of them have lost and you need to scoop it in there.

230
00:27:31,520 --> 00:27:37,800
You fill it up to the line, close up the top, put the patient's label on there and send it to the lab.

231
00:27:37,800 --> 00:27:47,660
Make sure the top is securely on because it is not being tested. So we need stool to test for Campylobacter and sometimes we need blood also.

232
00:27:47,660 --> 00:27:55,100
And here it says for stool delayed one two hours. Yes, use KEIBLER Transport media but most places have gone just using routine care.

233
00:27:55,100 --> 00:27:59,000
Blair Transport and not saying is it longer than two hours, shorter than two hours?

234
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:01,640
Just put it in the transport and send it to us.

235
00:28:01,640 --> 00:28:08,480
Even if you know you're here and in one side of the hospital and in the other side of the hospital as a laboratory,

236
00:28:08,480 --> 00:28:17,350
it still has to go through the tube system and who knows where I'll end up put it in the transport.

237
00:28:17,350 --> 00:28:24,880
I'm sorry if the school says you can't if it's in a transport tube, OK?

238
00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:30,040
I mean, have you been in the hospital where you couldn't send it? Yeah. To be a hospital, OK?

239
00:28:30,040 --> 00:28:34,390
Do they not have a tube system? They do. They won't send it to school.

240
00:28:34,390 --> 00:28:39,840
Oh, wow, OK. They must have had problems in the past. Yeah.

241
00:28:39,840 --> 00:28:44,110
Yeah, well, we could certainly even at Beaumont and U of M and Henry Ford,

242
00:28:44,110 --> 00:28:52,300
there are times with this when the transport system, the tube system breaks down, but that's more unusual than usual.

243
00:28:52,300 --> 00:29:01,000
And if they're in transport and the top is on and then they can't just send the tube, they have to put it in a double generally double Ziploc bag.

244
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:09,430
So a Ziploc bag inside of another Ziploc bag and then then put it in the Senate and on nurses and the bags is coming.

245
00:29:09,430 --> 00:29:14,430
Oh, I understand that. Yeah. I thought.

246
00:29:14,430 --> 00:29:19,750
No bill. They as long as their package correct. And they can be sent through the tube system.

247
00:29:19,750 --> 00:29:25,810
OK. So we use we could use blood, but wouldn't tell us anything.

248
00:29:25,810 --> 00:29:31,930
So we generally include blood. We also have selective media for stool specimens.

249
00:29:31,930 --> 00:29:36,160
So we've got blood and mcconkey. Those are our general media sort of.

250
00:29:36,160 --> 00:29:45,970
Media include Campi Kva. It's a Brucella organ, so it's very rich and it's got antibiotics in it and I'll knock out the other organisms.

251
00:29:45,970 --> 00:29:48,760
The non can be most of the non can't be organisms,

252
00:29:48,760 --> 00:29:55,510
so you can see the antibiotic stuff appears on Vanko and Amphotericin B and after B is a great antifungal.

253
00:29:55,510 --> 00:29:58,930
OK, and then has she blood in it also?

254
00:29:58,930 --> 00:30:07,280
So there's a can't be blood auger at Bournemouth, University of Michigan and Beaumont Health, so it's giving both the places we use to be.

255
00:30:07,280 --> 00:30:12,640
I used to use a bristle base with antibiotics and you could see the antibiotics there.

256
00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:17,590
It's got five antibiotics and five percent sheep, so you're culturing for Campylobacter.

257
00:30:17,590 --> 00:30:23,920
We're going to grow it at 42 degrees and that will inhibit the growth of most of the other stool flora.

258
00:30:23,920 --> 00:30:29,860
OK. And then you reduce the amount of oxygen so that micro aerobic, as you can see here,

259
00:30:29,860 --> 00:30:36,640
it's 10 percent CO2, five percent oxygen, 85 percent nitrogen, and you incubated for up to 72 hours.

260
00:30:36,640 --> 00:30:51,210
And between the micro, aerobic and the antibiotics in the media, you get pretty good growth of candy without much other organisms growing there.

261
00:30:51,210 --> 00:31:05,400
So what about blood cultures? We can if you think a patient is septic from a diarrheal illness, yes, you need to do a blood culture.

262
00:31:05,400 --> 00:31:09,570
We can detect campylobacter in the blood cultures. That's not a problem.

263
00:31:09,570 --> 00:31:21,460
But if we do, if you have to subculture to do biochemical I.D., we have to put it in the right atmosphere, which is my brother.

264
00:31:21,460 --> 00:31:26,140
OK. Going on with our lab diagnosis on microbiology diagnosis.

265
00:31:26,140 --> 00:31:33,490
OK. Campylobacter grows at 40 to remember that micro Arabic British colonies.

266
00:31:33,490 --> 00:31:38,650
It's a gram negative rods, and it may not take up the sting very well.

267
00:31:38,650 --> 00:31:45,610
They look kind of a faint pink instead of bright pink. Small rods, they might be curved.

268
00:31:45,610 --> 00:31:50,860
They might be single shaking and single shape is like this. OK.

269
00:31:50,860 --> 00:31:55,060
It might be that with if they're stuck together, they are mortal.

270
00:31:55,060 --> 00:32:04,660
If you have a wet prep, they dart like that on the leper oxidase and catalyze positive and you report out Campylobacter species.

271
00:32:04,660 --> 00:32:15,570
You cannot call into duty without doing additional testing. So here's a jejuni, and you can see it on.

272
00:32:15,570 --> 00:32:21,030
This is on special media for Campylobacter. And this is from CDC public.

273
00:32:21,030 --> 00:32:28,350
You know what pictures? CDC is a great place for pictures, for anything in the laboratory or any diseases.

274
00:32:28,350 --> 00:32:31,710
So this is a CDC field public health image library.

275
00:32:31,710 --> 00:32:35,940
I was on a CDC committee for two years and I learned all sorts of things.

276
00:32:35,940 --> 00:32:41,160
So, yeah, great. Great pictures from CDC, OK?

277
00:32:41,160 --> 00:32:49,080
DNA CCR, which is what we use, is a Columbia blood donor base such as the same as we use for blood out of Columbia blood.

278
00:32:49,080 --> 00:32:57,020
It has seven percent life, tourist blood and antibiotics, and the antibiotics will knock out that normal flora for the most part.

279
00:32:57,020 --> 00:33:06,390
A few might get through, but not very much. OK, so here's a skinny hop in the upper left hand side, a scanning medium of Campbell, Patrick Stewart,

280
00:33:06,390 --> 00:33:11,940
and you can see there are actually curved rods, but you can imagine what the magnification is on this.

281
00:33:11,940 --> 00:33:17,760
So if you look on the right hand side here, you can kind of tell that there might be a little bit curved,

282
00:33:17,760 --> 00:33:22,950
but you don't know how many are stuck together. But they do look a little curved and they're not very plump.

283
00:33:22,950 --> 00:33:34,800
They're fairly thin. So what do we treat a patient with Campylobacter with antibiotics?

284
00:33:34,800 --> 00:33:42,810
They should be susceptible to the macrolides like a risk for myself and clindamycin, the tetracyclines, the aminoglycosides,

285
00:33:42,810 --> 00:33:50,670
which is gentamicin and the quinolones erythromycin is generally the drug of choice for campylobacter

286
00:33:50,670 --> 00:33:56,700
for severe illness and Cipro is the alternative if the patient can't take erythromycin,

287
00:33:56,700 --> 00:34:00,300
if it is a systemic infection in the blood.

288
00:34:00,300 --> 00:34:15,930
The patient will need I.V. fare. So going on to another lovely little organism called Legionella Species.

289
00:34:15,930 --> 00:34:20,130
We have this list keeps growing the list as of a couple of years ago,

290
00:34:20,130 --> 00:34:27,690
I did not update the list pneumophila serotypes one through 15 big data Ibos money I do mafia.

291
00:34:27,690 --> 00:34:34,650
I used to be, you know, more that you do not need to be here in Michigan feeling like you can go on down the list

292
00:34:34,650 --> 00:34:40,260
down towards worthy species isolated from the environment only is on the right hand side.

293
00:34:40,260 --> 00:34:49,380
So we really don't need to worry about these too much until they get the ability to infect humans is over 40 different species in the genus,

294
00:34:49,380 --> 00:34:57,030
but Legionella pneumophila is the predominant one.

295
00:34:57,030 --> 00:35:01,780
So it is everywhere in the environment, and it likes water.

296
00:35:01,780 --> 00:35:07,710
They like standing water. It likes water from systems that have been used regularly.

297
00:35:07,710 --> 00:35:13,210
So all those buildings that were closed last summer and their water systems weren't being used.

298
00:35:13,210 --> 00:35:22,170
Many of them had a problem with legionella when they started using the water again, widely distributed nature.

299
00:35:22,170 --> 00:35:26,490
Both a natural and manmade environment. It's a quiet environmentally.

300
00:35:26,490 --> 00:35:35,870
There's no person to person spread. OK. I you can get exposed through aerosolized organisms.

301
00:35:35,870 --> 00:35:42,410
You know, sometimes there are some I don't know what the companies are, but they blow humid air out from the back of the company.

302
00:35:42,410 --> 00:35:49,820
I don't know what it is and you could. That's a good way to get exposed. They can infect and multiply within free living parasites.

303
00:35:49,820 --> 00:35:57,650
And so they survive in very well in the environment and they resist the resist destruction by phagocytosis,

304
00:35:57,650 --> 00:36:02,480
which means trying to kill them once they're in a human, so they survive very well.

305
00:36:02,480 --> 00:36:13,640
It's like the ideal pathogen. So I assume that all of you know that we didn't know about Legion of Legionella until 1976,

306
00:36:13,640 --> 00:36:24,800
where there was a bad outbreak at the American Legion Convention in Philadelphia did not grow on routine media identification required months by CDC,

307
00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:35,030
which is not unusual with a totally new organism caused fever pneumonia case fatality rate was 10 to 20 percent, the higher number that 20 percent.

308
00:36:35,030 --> 00:36:48,490
If you think about the Legionnaires, many of them are older, and so probably they were more susceptible to a pulmonary infection.

309
00:36:48,490 --> 00:37:00,290
So the highest risk populations are immunocompromised, as you would expect heavy smokers and people who are over the age of 60.

310
00:37:00,290 --> 00:37:07,460
Now, this is a interesting organism, because it can manifest itself differently in different humans,

311
00:37:07,460 --> 00:37:12,380
so sometimes it might be a pulmonary infection, not too bad.

312
00:37:12,380 --> 00:37:18,740
Sometimes it could be a rip roaring pulmonary infection. Sometimes there could be some other type of an infection.

313
00:37:18,740 --> 00:37:22,760
And this is also impacted by the human's own immunity.

314
00:37:22,760 --> 00:37:29,570
And how much of a dose? How much did that patient breathe in?

315
00:37:29,570 --> 00:37:36,290
So what do we do in the lab? Well, we have to have a specimen and the best specimen is not sputum.

316
00:37:36,290 --> 00:37:40,100
The best person is a more invasive respiratory specimen.

317
00:37:40,100 --> 00:37:48,320
So pleural fluid, bronchial alveolar fluid, anything that's more invasive, we can culture sputum.

318
00:37:48,320 --> 00:37:53,750
But the further we can give the specimen from deeper in the chest, the better off it will be.

319
00:37:53,750 --> 00:38:02,870
We can look at blood tissue biopsy material. We use standard precautions, which means we work up everything in a biological safety cabinet.

320
00:38:02,870 --> 00:38:11,230
The tech working there has gloves on lab coat mask, even though she's working in the biological safety cabinet.

321
00:38:11,230 --> 00:38:19,420
And if it's a liquid specimen, we can concentrate it by centrifugation.

322
00:38:19,420 --> 00:38:22,870
So what about this is a serious illness really,

323
00:38:22,870 --> 00:38:31,660
truly is serious because people over the age of 60 may have other co-morbidities, probably especially pulmonary issues.

324
00:38:31,660 --> 00:38:36,880
And this is it starts out as a pulmonary disease, so it can be very, very bad.

325
00:38:36,880 --> 00:38:46,570
So we can do direct fluorescent antibody as a direct test on specimens from the respiratory system.

326
00:38:46,570 --> 00:38:53,170
It's good. It's not as good as a molecular test. This is an antigen detection test.

327
00:38:53,170 --> 00:38:59,980
We can do a urine antigen test, which is really a pretty good test and just on a sample of urine it.

328
00:38:59,980 --> 00:39:14,200
But it only detects Legionella pneumophila serogroup one. But Legionella pneumophila serogroup one is the most common legionella that causes disease.

329
00:39:14,200 --> 00:39:23,050
So here is a lead in all of DFA, and you can't tell anything about the grandstand from that, can you, because it's a fluorescent test.

330
00:39:23,050 --> 00:39:27,160
Don't get tripped up on a question like that with all abrahamsen.

331
00:39:27,160 --> 00:39:35,590
Well, it's a fluorescent test, and there's just an example of one of the urine antigen tests.

332
00:39:35,590 --> 00:39:39,850
We can culture it. We have specialized media for legionella.

333
00:39:39,850 --> 00:39:45,880
It has buffered charcoal, has yeast extract, so it's called B.S. wipe off of charcoal yeast extract.

334
00:39:45,880 --> 00:39:50,230
Auger of the charcoal will detoxify the specimen.

335
00:39:50,230 --> 00:39:56,050
We're not talking to detoxify the organism or detoxify the specimen assisted and inhibitors,

336
00:39:56,050 --> 00:40:05,950
antibiotic inhibitors that are shown here by mix and be in the semis in a supplemental a 35 37 in room air, not CO2.

337
00:40:05,950 --> 00:40:13,060
Most things we would say we want CO2. We can incubate rumor that culture has to go for seven to 10 days.

338
00:40:13,060 --> 00:40:17,530
So what do we do with the patient for seven to 10 days?

339
00:40:17,530 --> 00:40:24,900
Generally, they will start the patient on therapy. And most lads, if if they don't have a molecular test for legionella,

340
00:40:24,900 --> 00:40:33,330
which most do know how to they don't, they would send the specimen off to the state.

341
00:40:33,330 --> 00:40:42,480
So what do we how do we identify this small group white to blue green colonies there with they kind of sparkle like a grand glass appearance.

342
00:40:42,480 --> 00:40:49,000
It's a thin gram negative rod. That's what you see on gram stain.

343
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:52,840
We can identify the colony using FAA reagents.

344
00:40:52,840 --> 00:41:00,130
They work very, very well. You would then reported this legionella species because the FAA reagents don't seem pneumophila.

345
00:41:00,130 --> 00:41:05,380
They just go to legionella species. You get that it's immediately after the state public health lab.

346
00:41:05,380 --> 00:41:18,490
No question about it. Here's the colonies on B.C. why you can't really see in this, that they're kind of sparkly,

347
00:41:18,490 --> 00:41:28,030
the kind of glitter kilograms, and you can see the long, thin gram negative rods kind of curved.

348
00:41:28,030 --> 00:41:39,130
So susceptibility testing the in vitro results do not correlate with in vivo response, so we don't do susceptibility tests, not routinely.

349
00:41:39,130 --> 00:41:48,510
If you have a highly immunocompromised patient, the infectious disease physician, seeing the patient may say, okay, just set it off somewhere.

350
00:41:48,510 --> 00:41:55,060
It's just that this is not working. So, you know, the we will search and say, Mayo can do this.

351
00:41:55,060 --> 00:42:05,050
You know what's involved, Mayo? Generally, patients are treated with azithromycin for what's called atypical pneumonia.

352
00:42:05,050 --> 00:42:14,410
So azithromycin works very, very well. If the patient is really, really seriously ill, might give them a fluoroquinolone.

353
00:42:14,410 --> 00:42:18,110
But no, the antibiotics that we generally use will not work here.

354
00:42:18,110 --> 00:42:23,620
Penicillin, cephalosporins and aminoglycosides may have like sites like Jeremiah's gentamicin,

355
00:42:23,620 --> 00:42:28,210
total mice and selfless ones like self-testing and so on.

356
00:42:28,210 --> 00:42:39,990
And you know, they do not work. So now we go to Bartonella species.

357
00:42:39,990 --> 00:42:53,160
Now, where are we in time? Well, we do agree there are thirty five species of Bartonella at last count, but only for 14 of them cause human disease.

358
00:42:53,160 --> 00:43:00,590
And here are the two most important Bartonella when Tana and Bartonella and sell and sell and sell.

359
00:43:00,590 --> 00:43:14,080
So where do we get them? The reservoirs and failures from domestic cats and countries, from other humans, or maybe from rodents.

360
00:43:14,080 --> 00:43:25,310
How is it transmitted, the human body allows for Clinton, on the other hand, sell as cat bites, scratches, fleas, ticks and so on.

361
00:43:25,310 --> 00:43:28,700
What is it cause it causes very, very serious illness.

362
00:43:28,700 --> 00:43:36,310
We generally don't see trench fever in the United States, but a serious case of Bartonella could cause trench fever.

363
00:43:36,310 --> 00:43:41,280
And this is more like something from World War Two causes relapsing fever.

364
00:43:41,280 --> 00:43:45,380
A bacteremia can cause endocarditis can cause death.

365
00:43:45,380 --> 00:43:53,270
Laryngeal the. With that nasty can cause multiple types of very serious illnesses and silly.

366
00:43:53,270 --> 00:44:02,300
I'm sure some people have heard of cat scratch disease. That's what it causes. Can cause, can also cause bacteremia endocarditis.

367
00:44:02,300 --> 00:44:11,390
That's laryngeal mitosis and so on. So there can be some very, very serious illnesses caused by Bartonella species.

368
00:44:11,390 --> 00:44:14,510
We don't see much of it. But if it's suspected,

369
00:44:14,510 --> 00:44:25,690
there will be an infectious diseases physician on board directing what to do with this patient and the kind of testing that's needed.

370
00:44:25,690 --> 00:44:36,580
So these are primarily from zoonotic infections transmitted from humans, from animals to humans, not humans, animals, from animals to humans.

371
00:44:36,580 --> 00:44:43,870
And if patients are immunocompromised and they can't remove that immunocompromised state,

372
00:44:43,870 --> 00:44:49,810
the disease will become much more important because they can't fight it off.

373
00:44:49,810 --> 00:44:57,940
OK. The diseases all seem to be played by the different organisms, pathologically similar,

374
00:44:57,940 --> 00:45:09,040
but we really don't know that much about the pathogenesis of this. So let's talk a little bit about political characteristics of trench fever.

375
00:45:09,040 --> 00:45:19,240
So this is transmitted from the human body louse, which I hope we don't have much of many soldiers who fought in the war is used to get this.

376
00:45:19,240 --> 00:45:23,680
It causes an influenza like headache, bone pain.

377
00:45:23,680 --> 00:45:28,750
The spleen can get enlarged, but there can be a natural path to a rash.

378
00:45:28,750 --> 00:45:35,290
It can cause a bloodstream infection might be blood culture negative because it won't

379
00:45:35,290 --> 00:45:40,870
grow in the blood culture system can cause infection of the heart and endocarditis.

380
00:45:40,870 --> 00:45:48,100
Chronic look that nobody likes homelands can't actually cause something you may have heard about Besler, NGO Metulla,

381
00:45:48,100 --> 00:45:56,240
which if you can say that you're doing really well, it's a vascular proliferation of the disease in the skin, and we don't see it very often.

382
00:45:56,240 --> 00:46:02,980
But when we do have people, look at this. Let's get some pictures.

383
00:46:02,980 --> 00:46:09,970
So, but I assume some of you have heard of cat scratch fever and not just the song, but cat scratch.

384
00:46:09,970 --> 00:46:17,140
It's a popular puzzle can develop at the sight of the cat scratch or cat bite also.

385
00:46:17,140 --> 00:46:22,360
It can cause really tender regional lymphadenopathy very, very tender.

386
00:46:22,360 --> 00:46:27,490
But it takes a while for that to develop and the person may not remember the cat scratch.

387
00:46:27,490 --> 00:46:32,920
OK. It's from one to seven weeks while six weeks out. Are you going to remember if you got scratched by your cat?

388
00:46:32,920 --> 00:46:40,690
Probably not, since the disease itself can be chronic mean going on for a long time,

389
00:46:40,690 --> 00:46:47,890
can be self-limited, can have another thing to a very, very severe systemic illness.

390
00:46:47,890 --> 00:46:57,040
Patients in the ICU so it can have lots of different forms of this disease.

391
00:46:57,040 --> 00:46:59,590
So here's an example of cat scratch disease on the top,

392
00:46:59,590 --> 00:47:05,500
and you can see a person who's been scratched here on the hand and you've got some redness around it.

393
00:47:05,500 --> 00:47:18,510
And then in the bottom tissue you see a lymphadenopathy. I do the Bartonella, and that's a very large, swollen lymph.

394
00:47:18,510 --> 00:47:24,180
What do we do to diagnose it in the laboratory, have to get a specimen into the lab before we can do anything,

395
00:47:24,180 --> 00:47:32,850
and the appropriate specimen would be blood tissue from an infected side or what appears to be an infected site and biopsy material.

396
00:47:32,850 --> 00:47:37,390
There is a PCR for detection in tissue or body fluids.

397
00:47:37,390 --> 00:47:42,030
However, most labs, most clinical labs do not have the reagents to do that.

398
00:47:42,030 --> 00:47:52,790
And it would probably go to public health or a major reference lab such as Mayo.

399
00:47:52,790 --> 00:47:56,840
Well, next thing on the list is culture, can we culture it?

400
00:47:56,840 --> 00:48:01,070
This is very fastidious organism, meaning it doesn't just grow on blood Typekit,

401
00:48:01,070 --> 00:48:08,630
you've got to have specialized media, specialized conditions and so on. So generally, we don't culture for Bartonella.

402
00:48:08,630 --> 00:48:11,840
There's a very low recovery rate.

403
00:48:11,840 --> 00:48:20,510
And then of course, there's that the other issue that if you're not used to seeing it, you're not used to what it looks like on plates or in tubes.

404
00:48:20,510 --> 00:48:25,910
There can be lab accidents. So generally, it's not cultured.

405
00:48:25,910 --> 00:48:35,350
It's diagnosed based on pathologic diagnosis or maybe a molecular assay.

406
00:48:35,350 --> 00:48:41,470
So we can also do a thorough diagnosis, we can look for antibodies. And this is the main means for diagnosis.

407
00:48:41,470 --> 00:48:45,400
Here is an immunofluorescence assay.

408
00:48:45,400 --> 00:49:03,490
But to remember, the patients who have HIV that is not well controlled may not develop any antibodies to this organism because of their HIV infection.

409
00:49:03,490 --> 00:49:13,010
So not only do you have an immunocompromised patient, but you have a disease that's very difficult to diagnose.

410
00:49:13,010 --> 00:49:18,200
And this is where the cloned micro laboratories all get together and they call each other to, have you ever seen this?

411
00:49:18,200 --> 00:49:21,080
What have you done? You know, how did you get it diagnosed and so on?

412
00:49:21,080 --> 00:49:29,690
And the major reference labs are pretty good at handling things like this, as well as public health.

413
00:49:29,690 --> 00:49:41,660
So we don't do susceptibility testing because it's so fastidious and we have to have specific methods if we even saw one patient with this a year.

414
00:49:41,660 --> 00:49:44,600
That would be surprising. That's how rare it is.

415
00:49:44,600 --> 00:49:51,110
So if they need susceptibility patients got a lot of drug allergies or something, they'd have to go to a reference lab or public health.

416
00:49:51,110 --> 00:49:53,210
The CDC, probably.

417
00:49:53,210 --> 00:50:04,850
Patients can be treated with immediate like sites like any other media like sites, Meissen and so on will work better, like MS Erythromycin and Doxy.

418
00:50:04,850 --> 00:50:21,620
Now, individuals who are immunocompromised so they're at risk should avoid cats because certainly cats can transmit.

419
00:50:21,620 --> 00:50:32,090
Now they're going on to his office in Bordetella and office, actually one of my favorite organisms watertight to that, but I like so.

420
00:50:32,090 --> 00:50:39,260
And you will see a lot more infections with Haemophilus influenzae in particular in your career.

421
00:50:39,260 --> 00:50:43,670
Hopefully, not too many botulism. So marvelous influenza.

422
00:50:43,670 --> 00:50:51,260
The organism is normal flora of the human respiratory tract, particularly the upper respiratory tract.

423
00:50:51,260 --> 00:50:57,950
It can spread by person to person, spread by droplets and sometimes endogenous spread.

424
00:50:57,950 --> 00:51:04,730
So there are other human Haemophilus species also normal for the human upper respiratory tract.

425
00:51:04,730 --> 00:51:11,390
They don't spread that easily because they're not that good of pathogens.

426
00:51:11,390 --> 00:51:18,260
So but they can spread to non respiratory tract sites where they can cause disease.

427
00:51:18,260 --> 00:51:27,200
This, though, is not common at all whatsoever. Each flu is the is the common one here, and that's the one that we all have to worry about know about.

428
00:51:27,200 --> 00:51:30,530
I wouldn't say worried. Just know about it.

429
00:51:30,530 --> 00:51:39,500
So novel influenza has a capsule, I remember if an organism has a capsule, it's very, very difficult to phagocytosis it.

430
00:51:39,500 --> 00:51:48,680
OK? It's like a big spiny area all around the organism, and the white blood cells can't really gather it in.

431
00:51:48,680 --> 00:51:53,480
OK, so it's got enhanced resistance to phagocytosis by the capsule.

432
00:51:53,480 --> 00:51:57,890
Their capsule always affects serologic typing.

433
00:51:57,890 --> 00:52:03,950
And so there are six different serologic types easily named A, B, C, D E F,

434
00:52:03,950 --> 00:52:08,270
and of these, B is the most common causes, the most serious types of infections.

435
00:52:08,270 --> 00:52:15,920
How does anybody here have a little kid? Little kids are particularly susceptible to Haemophilus influenzae type b,

436
00:52:15,920 --> 00:52:21,980
everything from respiratory infections, ear infections all the way to bloodstream infections.

437
00:52:21,980 --> 00:52:25,790
It is a serious pathogen, particularly in little kids.

438
00:52:25,790 --> 00:52:32,780
Now, that doesn't mean that adults can't get it certainly can get it, but little kids are particularly susceptible to it.

439
00:52:32,780 --> 00:52:37,790
The infections may be systemic. They may be life threatening. Could be meningitis.

440
00:52:37,790 --> 00:52:46,760
We see that commonly with this organism. Epiglottis cellulitis with bacteremia and even septic arthritis and pneumonia.

441
00:52:46,760 --> 00:52:53,090
More is more common in septic arthritis. And because it has this capsule, that makes it more virulent.

442
00:52:53,090 --> 00:52:58,280
But it has other factors that promote attachment to human epithelial cells,

443
00:52:58,280 --> 00:53:07,590
and it loves those epithelial cells, likes to grab on and set up an infection.

444
00:53:07,590 --> 00:53:11,520
So there are I said there are the capsule strains are type of ball, a b,

445
00:53:11,520 --> 00:53:21,870
c d e f r non-tech tropical strains that do not produce a or non non-tribal because they don't have a capsule that have that capsule to be drivable.

446
00:53:21,870 --> 00:53:27,720
So and then these strains, because they don't have the capsule that can't help cause illness.

447
00:53:27,720 --> 00:53:33,450
They have virulence mediated through the attachment, so they have pillai and so on.

448
00:53:33,450 --> 00:53:41,430
To help grab on to a susceptible cell and set up an infection, generally, the infections are less serious, more localized.

449
00:53:41,430 --> 00:53:44,640
So ear infections with age flu are very common.

450
00:53:44,640 --> 00:53:52,020
Otitis media, they're very common in sinusitis, very common conjunctivitis and bronchitis, very common.

451
00:53:52,020 --> 00:53:56,790
Now, if a patient has underlying medical conditions,

452
00:53:56,790 --> 00:54:02,310
they can have more serious illnesses with a flu pneumonia, and that bacteria is certainly very, very serious.

453
00:54:02,310 --> 00:54:10,140
People bacteremia. This is a major pathogen in patients with cystic fibrosis.

454
00:54:10,140 --> 00:54:15,220
But we know that their risk to our system does not work the way that it should

455
00:54:15,220 --> 00:54:22,470
because of the disease here when we see a specimen from a cystic fibrosis patient.

456
00:54:22,470 --> 00:54:29,400
And an encapsulated organism that organism can take over that capsule is big and juicy,

457
00:54:29,400 --> 00:54:38,880
and nothing's going to go around it because their immune system is not working the way that it should.

458
00:54:38,880 --> 00:54:41,910
So there are other hemophilia species also, we don't worry too much about them,

459
00:54:41,910 --> 00:54:47,790
there are lower virulence and there they can be opportunistic pathogens, but we just don't worry about them that much.

460
00:54:47,790 --> 00:54:52,920
They can cause infections, similar age flu, but that's less common.

461
00:54:52,920 --> 00:54:53,790
We worry about them.

462
00:54:53,790 --> 00:55:03,150
Office influenza now, if you see another Haemophilus species in blood or isolated directly from tissue, that will be very serious.

463
00:55:03,150 --> 00:55:11,300
Also, but not for influenza, is the one to worry about here.

464
00:55:11,300 --> 00:55:17,210
So once again, lab diagnosis, what do we do? Well, we have to get a specimen in the laboratory.

465
00:55:17,210 --> 00:55:22,820
And I said before we come up with influenza likes a lot of different sites in the human body,

466
00:55:22,820 --> 00:55:25,980
so it can be recovered from many different types of clinical specimens.

467
00:55:25,980 --> 00:55:34,400
Certainly the most common is respiratory, but in a child, we easily get it out of the eye of a blood culture from the child.

468
00:55:34,400 --> 00:55:42,140
Children have relatively large amounts of Haemophilus influenzae in their blood when they're infected with it, when they have sepsis with it.

469
00:55:42,140 --> 00:55:46,990
So the thing to remember here is this organism is susceptible to drying and temperature extremes.

470
00:55:46,990 --> 00:55:52,370
So we have to be very careful about your hand how you handle that specimen before it gets to the lab.

471
00:55:52,370 --> 00:55:56,870
Don't put it in the refrigerator. You don't have a long transport time.

472
00:55:56,870 --> 00:56:12,090
You want to get to the laboratory as soon as possible. We can detect the organism by a gram stain, depending on the specimen type.

473
00:56:12,090 --> 00:56:17,250
Certainly the most common type would be a respiratory specimen or a blood specimen.

474
00:56:17,250 --> 00:56:25,470
If it's a blood specimen, the organism in the specimen would have been put into bottles and after the flag is positive,

475
00:56:25,470 --> 00:56:27,930
then an alcohol is taken out of the bottle.

476
00:56:27,930 --> 00:56:36,270
Slimy and stained, and that's where you could see these sort of fairly faintly staining gram negative bacilli.

477
00:56:36,270 --> 00:56:42,270
OK. Certainly, you can see that in good respiratory specimens. Also, that'd be a good sputum.

478
00:56:42,270 --> 00:56:49,350
Did I tell you how to tell if it's a good sputum? I don't know if I did or not. Good sputum specimen will have a patient who is infected.

479
00:56:49,350 --> 00:56:56,420
Very few epithelial cells and lots of polyps.

480
00:56:56,420 --> 00:57:08,270
OK, if it's a bad specimen, you're going to see a lot of the fetal cells and probably any polls.

481
00:57:08,270 --> 00:57:15,380
So here is a gram stain, and this is from a culture, this is not from a specimen and this is the very,

482
00:57:15,380 --> 00:57:24,300
very small gram negative rods and you can hardly tell if their rods at all.

483
00:57:24,300 --> 00:57:25,830
So how do we culture it?

484
00:57:25,830 --> 00:57:36,360
It's a very fastidious organism, so it will not grow on sheep blood because she blood only has him and it requires human and friendly factor.

485
00:57:36,360 --> 00:57:38,340
I'm sure you've heard about X and B factors.

486
00:57:38,340 --> 00:57:46,200
The X Factor's human need is de facto you have to have both to grow Haemophilus influenzae so it will grow on chocolate.

487
00:57:46,200 --> 00:57:58,720
But it will not grow on sheep blood either, unless you co cultivated with another organism that would provide the B factor.

488
00:57:58,720 --> 00:58:03,700
But here's the way an old fashioned way of test for identification. We don't do this anymore.

489
00:58:03,700 --> 00:58:14,230
So we have the X Factor and the B factor on strips of kind of the V is upside down and then the bottom one is has both X and B this nutrient auger.

490
00:58:14,230 --> 00:58:25,750
And you can see that it's growing around the X Factor strip, but not by all, not by the single a the or the single X Factor.

491
00:58:25,750 --> 00:58:36,940
So in these bold X and these factors for growth. So what about growing it in the laboratory is the actually fairly easy go in the laboratory,

492
00:58:36,940 --> 00:58:45,480
at least thirty five to thirty seven degrees must have five to 10 percent CO2 and really some of the will go on 24 hours.

493
00:58:45,480 --> 00:58:52,110
A lot of it depends on the load of the organism, but certainly by three days we should be seeing growth.

494
00:58:52,110 --> 00:59:00,240
There's small transistor colonies. Once again, they won't grow in blood either, unless there's a staff source close by to provide the entity.

495
00:59:00,240 --> 00:59:07,260
So talk it over is the way to go with these. But when you're supporting a positive blood culture, you put it on some culture and blood,

496
00:59:07,260 --> 00:59:13,510
chocolate and bookies to increase your chances that you're going to see growth in the next day.

497
00:59:13,510 --> 00:59:18,490
So here it is on Chocolate Auger. And then you see, they're kind of what colonies?

498
00:59:18,490 --> 00:59:24,040
Not really Newport, but close to they can have colonies, but not seen in this one.

499
00:59:24,040 --> 00:59:37,240
In this photograph? So when we identify in the laboratory by old fashioned methods, non non Maldi,

500
00:59:37,240 --> 00:59:41,560
we look what we look to see, what is going on is a growing up blood droplet.

501
00:59:41,560 --> 00:59:47,020
Both McConkey know it's not going to ever be grown. Maconochie that will run blood unless his staph aureus nearby.

502
00:59:47,020 --> 00:59:57,010
So does only grow on on chocolate. Yes. We look at the Graham Stanley morphology very short gram negative rods we can test for X and B factor.

503
00:59:57,010 --> 01:00:08,990
So I showed you an example of X Factor testing. And you can add other biochemical tests or you can just go to body.

504
01:00:08,990 --> 01:00:19,670
So we absolutely have to do susceptibility testing on every Haemophilus influenza from a serious infection and in the lab,

505
01:00:19,670 --> 01:00:20,750
we don't know which ones are serious.

506
01:00:20,750 --> 01:00:31,490
So anything from tissue, blood, anything, you know, if it's just a throat, we probably wouldn't do anything but to be the litmus test on it.

507
01:00:31,490 --> 01:00:37,040
But anything else, we have to do susceptibility testing. We can do this diffusion, the Kirby Bower method.

508
01:00:37,040 --> 01:00:44,510
We can do solution either micro evolution or to do it in most labs now to do broad market solution.

509
01:00:44,510 --> 01:00:48,830
Once again, we have to have special supplement media so that it will grow.

510
01:00:48,830 --> 01:00:55,460
We just want to put it in just so broad. It's not going to grow and have to do beta lactamase.

511
01:00:55,460 --> 01:01:04,130
Testing the incidence of beta lactamase positivity and Haemophilus influenzae has skyrocketed so over the last 20 years or so.

512
01:01:04,130 --> 01:01:10,610
And in fact, it's unusual now to find one that's not a beta lactamase producer.

513
01:01:10,610 --> 01:01:18,980
So when we talk about testing a panel of drugs for Haemophilus influenza, that's a bit of LACMA's producer.

514
01:01:18,980 --> 01:01:25,470
Penicillin is a no go. Almost all of the beta lactamase spawns want more.

515
01:01:25,470 --> 01:01:30,590
Sometimes the third generation may work depending on how you know the organism and the patient.

516
01:01:30,590 --> 01:01:38,540
But generally that's resistant. But if you can give the patient these higher level syphilis points of a taxi, Swift reacts reaction.

517
01:01:38,540 --> 01:01:45,630
It may work. So what about vaccine?

518
01:01:45,630 --> 01:01:48,300
It's a wonderful vaccine.

519
01:01:48,300 --> 01:01:56,400
I am a huge fan of vaccines, as if you didn't know that this is routinely given to little kids starting at two months of age.

520
01:01:56,400 --> 01:02:00,660
Remember, little kids are particularly susceptible to this organism.

521
01:02:00,660 --> 01:02:07,680
So we start the vaccine at about two months a it's a routine every pediatrician gives it,

522
01:02:07,680 --> 01:02:15,240
and it probably every family practitioner also gets a protein polysaccharide conjugated vaccine.

523
01:02:15,240 --> 01:02:25,080
It has amazing results in reducing the incidence of serious and life threatening infections in children.

524
01:02:25,080 --> 01:02:32,330
It is a wonderful, wonderful vaccine and it has saved many children's lives.

525
01:02:32,330 --> 01:02:45,710
So this is a very old chart. I downloaded from CDC years ago, and I just wanted to show you that with the advent of the use of vaccine,

526
01:02:45,710 --> 01:02:49,510
you can see that the rate of disease due to type B,

527
01:02:49,510 --> 01:02:58,250
the most serious type of Haemophilus influenzae type B bottomed out in just a few years after starting routine vaccination of little kids.

528
01:02:58,250 --> 01:03:04,010
And that number has stayed down. And it's it's a wonderful thing this is one of the best.

529
01:03:04,010 --> 01:03:14,060
Well, there are a lot of good vaccines, but this is one of the best newer ones. OK, broke on the board of Tesla.

530
01:03:14,060 --> 01:03:19,810
No joking pertussis. Got to make a joke one for one.

531
01:03:19,810 --> 01:03:24,830
Pertussis, pair of pertussis and bronchial cepted that will see all of them here in Michigan.

532
01:03:24,830 --> 01:03:29,050
Unfortunately, we don't see too much pertussis, but it does occur in outbreaks.

533
01:03:29,050 --> 01:03:37,840
It is not part of a person's normal flora. Person should not have Bordetella pertussis in their throat or in their lungs.

534
01:03:37,840 --> 01:03:45,820
It is transmitted person to person via coughs, and many people cough and don't cover.

535
01:03:45,820 --> 01:03:55,210
Now, in the age of masks, it were much better off. But there are still people who aren't wearing the masks correctly and can transmit diseases.

536
01:03:55,210 --> 01:04:03,970
Parrot pertussis is not part of the normal flora. It's only present during an infection, and we don't see that much pure pertussis.

537
01:04:03,970 --> 01:04:10,170
It was transmitted once again person to person airborne transmission via cough.

538
01:04:10,170 --> 01:04:20,070
And then Broncos ex-couple tell Broncos such that this is normal flora of animals and it inhabits the upper respiratory tract of animals and,

539
01:04:20,070 --> 01:04:30,570
you know, little kids like to get near their bunnies and their cats and the dogs and pet owners it there's no soft money how it's transmitted.

540
01:04:30,570 --> 01:04:36,390
So exposure to contaminated droplets following close contact with animals.

541
01:04:36,390 --> 01:04:41,550
And it would be an interesting study to see now that everybody's hopefully wearing masks.

542
01:04:41,550 --> 01:04:49,800
If the rate of this brought a subsequent disease to a broadcast that drops down, that would be very interesting.

543
01:04:49,800 --> 01:04:57,750
So I wanted to show you this American Journal of Public Health 1947,

544
01:04:57,750 --> 01:05:05,580
and it was written by Dr. Kendrick and Dr Elder Ling and then a couple of other people,

545
01:05:05,580 --> 01:05:14,920
Kendrick and Elder, and started the public health lab in Lansing. And at that time, all that time, the lab was in Grand Rapids,

546
01:05:14,920 --> 01:05:19,700
and they still have a small lab in Grand Rapids, but now almost everything comes to Lansing,

547
01:05:19,700 --> 01:05:29,810
and they they did the studies that showed that you could prevent pertussis or whooping cough by using the vaccines.

548
01:05:29,810 --> 01:05:36,950
And they did mouse protection tests. And this is one of the first great studies about pertussis.

549
01:05:36,950 --> 01:05:48,230
And I think everybody going into public health, particularly in this state, needs to know who drink and al-Dulaimi were.

550
01:05:48,230 --> 01:05:51,920
So. Talk about pertussis and of pertussis,

551
01:05:51,920 --> 01:05:59,960
because upper respiratory tract infections in humans doesn't make a difference if as pertussis or pair of pertussis,

552
01:05:59,960 --> 01:06:06,800
the symptoms are going to be the same. The epidemiology on this and the therapy are all going to be same.

553
01:06:06,800 --> 01:06:13,190
Pertussis is whooping cough, and it is very, very serious.

554
01:06:13,190 --> 01:06:19,460
Prior to the time of vaccination, and even now in families in which they don't believe in vaccinations,

555
01:06:19,460 --> 01:06:26,540
children would die of of whooping cough because they couldn't breathe. And I've got something that I hope will work and show it to you.

556
01:06:26,540 --> 01:06:32,180
I don't know if we're working here or not. We need special culture media to grow.

557
01:06:32,180 --> 01:06:35,750
This organism can't just grow one on one order.

558
01:06:35,750 --> 01:06:42,020
We need pertussis, specialized media. And then there's more to tell the Broncos skeptical.

559
01:06:42,020 --> 01:06:51,680
It's an opportunity. Hutton has an opportunistic infection in immunocompromised patients, and they get it from animals and can cause pneumonia,

560
01:06:51,680 --> 01:07:00,550
bacteremia, urinary tract infection, meningitis and you name it, it can cause it.

561
01:07:00,550 --> 01:07:04,090
So what's the epidemiology of all species?

562
01:07:04,090 --> 01:07:11,950
Pertussis, as I said before, is primary close, but until a pertussis may rarely be caused by a pair of pertussis,

563
01:07:11,950 --> 01:07:20,350
but generally it's pertussis, and it's pertussis causes much more serious disease than pure pertussis does.

564
01:07:20,350 --> 01:07:26,060
Higher infection rates, higher duration of illness. Higher death rates.

565
01:07:26,060 --> 01:07:33,770
Prior to the vaccine, epidemic, disease occurred in two to five year cycles,

566
01:07:33,770 --> 01:07:39,470
and this still is occurring in unvaccinated populations, not so much in the United States,

567
01:07:39,470 --> 01:07:42,200
although there are a lot of people don't believe in vaccines anymore,

568
01:07:42,200 --> 01:07:50,090
but certainly in other countries where they don't have access to the vaccines, they still have outbreaks of pertussis.

569
01:07:50,090 --> 01:08:01,520
We can all service reservoirs and transmit if we're not vaccinated will be transmitted to unvaccinated or vaccinated people with waning immunity.

570
01:08:01,520 --> 01:08:13,730
The vaccine does not last forever. Let's tell you what I did when I went to Bill Beaumont from the health department.

571
01:08:13,730 --> 01:08:18,320
I realized that I was really behind on all my vaccines, really behind.

572
01:08:18,320 --> 01:08:26,240
And the person who was the chief of infectious diseases and now he's a vice president of the institution or something I went to and I said,

573
01:08:26,240 --> 01:08:32,450
Chris, I need to be brought up to date. I'm behind on every single vaccine that I could possibly be behind on.

574
01:08:32,450 --> 01:08:38,510
He said, OK, I'm making your appointments. He's a real good friend of mine, also making your appointments in the infectious diseases clinic.

575
01:08:38,510 --> 01:08:45,680
I got so many vaccines within three months. It was crazy. They were like, they're giving me vaccines every other week.

576
01:08:45,680 --> 01:08:52,670
But he brought me up to date. I would not advise any of you to do that because I certainly didn't feel well for a while.

577
01:08:52,670 --> 01:08:56,930
Keep your vaccines up to date, please. I beg of you. I beg of you.

578
01:08:56,930 --> 01:09:05,930
OK, so we can serve as reservoirs and we don't want to give it to anyone, and we need to be boosted occasionally.

579
01:09:05,930 --> 01:09:09,420
So there are multiple virulence factors with pertussis.

580
01:09:09,420 --> 01:09:20,260
There's an adhesion, the vaccine clip to a cell and it has Hembree and filamentous filamentous hemagglutinin.

581
01:09:20,260 --> 01:09:30,410
It is has toxins which are even worse as a pertussis toxin, tracheal cytotoxic and cyclers toxic toxins are always bad.

582
01:09:30,410 --> 01:09:37,270
These are even worse. So here we have the spectrum of diseases control.

583
01:09:37,270 --> 01:09:44,120
It's like a mild cold, and you can last several weeks, not just by the average cold last five seven days.

584
01:09:44,120 --> 01:09:45,940
So this would be several weeks.

585
01:09:45,940 --> 01:09:56,260
We have paroxysmal where the severe coughing or whooping, and that's when two falls and then we have the convalescent period with decreasing symptoms.

586
01:09:56,260 --> 01:10:02,840
The patient may not feel clinically well for months.

587
01:10:02,840 --> 01:10:14,990
Symptoms that adults tend to be milder, they're often misdiagnosed his bronchitis, simple bronchitis doesn't tend to be mixed with other pathogens.

588
01:10:14,990 --> 01:10:32,020
I hope this works. I don't know if there's sand out here. Yes, we do want to.

589
01:10:32,020 --> 01:10:37,840
I don't want an ad. Dismiss.

590
01:10:37,840 --> 01:10:45,360
No, no, no, skip the ad. Well, please give me sound.

591
01:10:45,360 --> 01:10:50,550
No sound. Listen to this on your own, because most people don't know what whooping cough sounds like.

592
01:10:50,550 --> 01:10:55,060
Kids cough until they throw up. It is very, very serious.

593
01:10:55,060 --> 01:11:00,000
I can't get sound out here, I don't think.

594
01:11:00,000 --> 01:11:10,950
But listen to it at home. OK, so you know what it sounds like?

595
01:11:10,950 --> 01:11:16,230
And I probably just lost where I was, too. Oh, yeah, OK.

596
01:11:16,230 --> 01:11:22,270
I'm not going to even try and bring up the other one, but please listen to it so you know what it sounds like.

597
01:11:22,270 --> 01:11:24,340
So what do we do about lab diagnosis?

598
01:11:24,340 --> 01:11:32,480
Well, got to get a good specimen and a good specimen to be an MP swabbed and an MP swab is not just a nasal swab,

599
01:11:32,480 --> 01:11:42,190
and he's the one that goes really back far back. It's the one that nobody likes the use of very many tick swab, not the regular sized swab.

600
01:11:42,190 --> 01:11:47,590
And you think they're going to take your brain out? That's a good specimen.

601
01:11:47,590 --> 01:11:56,230
If you're doing a culture method, it has to be immediately inoculated to media.

602
01:11:56,230 --> 01:11:59,080
Andrew, excuse me, right at the bedside after you inoculate the media,

603
01:11:59,080 --> 01:12:03,520
don't make the smears before you nightly media because the slides are not sterile.

604
01:12:03,520 --> 01:12:10,510
If they're not directly inoculate, you have to put them in transport media and get into the lab as soon as possible.

605
01:12:10,510 --> 01:12:15,970
OK. But the better method is molecular. There's no question about it.

606
01:12:15,970 --> 01:12:19,570
The culture can take days and days to turn positive culture.

607
01:12:19,570 --> 01:12:25,480
We get the results within a much mature, usually 24 hours, submit the swab specimen to the lab.

608
01:12:25,480 --> 01:12:30,850
Usually, usually we reduce viral transport or even transport the system to the lab.

609
01:12:30,850 --> 01:12:38,750
Maybe using may have their own transport system, and you should use that. But the lab would let you know.

610
01:12:38,750 --> 01:12:50,390
We can do direct detection with the DFA of using public bodies to pertussis and ferroptosis once again, not as good as a molecular test.

611
01:12:50,390 --> 01:12:57,020
But if you don't have access to a molecular test, the lab may be able to do that if they have it in their repertoire.

612
01:12:57,020 --> 01:13:01,370
The sensitivity of this test, though, is limited at 50 to 70 percent at best.

613
01:13:01,370 --> 01:13:07,460
So you should also use a culture also if you're going to be using a BFA. There are various PCR methods.

614
01:13:07,460 --> 01:13:12,800
The commercial methods are excellent. I don't know any laboratories in using a homebrew PCR anymore.

615
01:13:12,800 --> 01:13:22,680
The commercial assays for pertussis are very, very good, and they're replacing culture is the gold standard here.

616
01:13:22,680 --> 01:13:33,460
So here is a DFA for Bordetella pertussis. You can see it's freezing and it's a short ride kind of plump.

617
01:13:33,460 --> 01:13:37,960
So historically, the culture was the gold standard, we didn't have molecular methods,

618
01:13:37,960 --> 01:13:44,380
we didn't have even antigen detection, we had to do culture and sometimes we had to do culture in an animal.

619
01:13:44,380 --> 01:13:48,760
But we've come so far in microbiology with molecular testing.

620
01:13:48,760 --> 01:13:49,720
You have to do culture.

621
01:13:49,720 --> 01:14:00,220
If you're doing a study, you need regular media, which is a charcoal logger with 10 percent horse blood and then to inhibit the normal flora.

622
01:14:00,220 --> 01:14:06,440
And it has a very limited shelf life because of the antibiotic. It's in the media.

623
01:14:06,440 --> 01:14:11,780
So if you're going to do a culture and say thirty five to thirty seven degrees as you would for any specimen from a human,

624
01:14:11,780 --> 01:14:19,850
just about I need CO2 five to 10 percent. And look at the activation time 10 to 12 days.

625
01:14:19,850 --> 01:14:25,940
Most days, let's grow in three to five days. But then you'd have to do an identification test also.

626
01:14:25,940 --> 01:14:31,250
So 10 to 12 days until you can say it's negative. Colonies are small.

627
01:14:31,250 --> 01:14:38,120
They sure they're kind of shiny. They're kind of pretty. They look like mercury drops. If you've ever seen the mercury drop, most people haven't.

628
01:14:38,120 --> 01:14:44,390
And the gravity will show a small, vaguely stinging gram negative half of the cells fairly small.

629
01:14:44,390 --> 01:14:48,620
Also, you can if you see that, you can.

630
01:14:48,620 --> 01:14:51,950
If you have the reagents and the test is approved for use in your laboratory,

631
01:14:51,950 --> 01:14:58,860
you can do a DFAT identified and that can distinguish between pertussis and pure pertussis.

632
01:14:58,860 --> 01:15:06,780
But most labs nowadays can't do that. They were doing molecular assay.

633
01:15:06,780 --> 01:15:12,450
So here is the the the colonies on Reagan law, which is specific for pertussis,

634
01:15:12,450 --> 01:15:20,220
and they look, do they have a kind of shiny appearance, a little like a mercury dress?

635
01:15:20,220 --> 01:15:33,770
And here's a crime scene, and you can see now this is not greatly magnified, but you can see that the cells are very, very short, very short.

636
01:15:33,770 --> 01:15:42,410
What about susceptibility testing? Nope, erythromycin invasive through my son are your choices.

637
01:15:42,410 --> 01:15:48,110
And so if somebody is allergic to erythromycin, they'll get azithromycin or vice versa, the other drugs of choice?

638
01:15:48,110 --> 01:15:51,680
If the patient can't take those drugs, there may be other choices.

639
01:15:51,680 --> 01:16:00,220
But those are the two drugs of choice for pertussis. What about the vaccine?

640
01:16:00,220 --> 01:16:08,260
It is wonderful. And I say that again, it is wonderful. Please, please, please keep your vaccines up there.

641
01:16:08,260 --> 01:16:13,810
Typically, in the past, historically also vaccines were used,

642
01:16:13,810 --> 01:16:19,750
but they had a lot of side effects and people didn't want to get vaccinated because of the side effects.

643
01:16:19,750 --> 01:16:23,320
And then they didn't last very long, those waning immunity.

644
01:16:23,320 --> 01:16:33,250
Now we have a cellular vaccines and these have booster shots for all the children and adults and less side effects.

645
01:16:33,250 --> 01:16:42,910
So this the ACLU vaccine, there are certainly a great improvement here.

646
01:16:42,910 --> 01:16:47,350
OK, now in Syria and more so.

647
01:16:47,350 --> 01:16:54,310
Does anybody know what's slide number one? Well, we're going to get through it myself.

648
01:16:54,310 --> 01:16:59,590
So nice here in Marcella Gram negative diplomatic oxide oxidase positive.

649
01:16:59,590 --> 01:17:07,000
Please do not ever forget that they're the only ones that are gram negative depiction of today's positive.

650
01:17:07,000 --> 01:17:14,710
I listed information about epidemiology and pathology, depending on which version of Bailey's got here you can look at.

651
01:17:14,710 --> 01:17:19,570
We've got the 13th, 14th and 15th and I listed the different tables in them.

652
01:17:19,570 --> 01:17:27,820
So you know what to look at? They talk about epidemiology and they talk about the pathogenesis.

653
01:17:27,820 --> 01:17:30,850
There are other Neisseria species there, nonpathogenic.

654
01:17:30,850 --> 01:17:35,950
For the most part, anything can be pathogenic in an immunocompromised person, but they're the generally other nice.

655
01:17:35,950 --> 01:17:44,360
Here are our colonizers or non pathogens. So here's an example of Table 45 when it talks about Marcelo Neisseria gonorrhea,

656
01:17:44,360 --> 01:17:48,700
Neisseria meningitidis and other Neisseria species talks about the habitat.

657
01:17:48,700 --> 01:17:50,860
Where do we find them?

658
01:17:50,860 --> 01:17:59,950
Whether it's part of the normal flora, Neisseria gonorrhea is not part of the normal flora only found on mucous membranes genitalia in a rural area.

659
01:17:59,950 --> 01:18:07,300
So on, Neisseria meningitidis can be a colonizer. Most people make it.

660
01:18:07,300 --> 01:18:11,680
They don't know if they have until something happens that their immunity is changed.

661
01:18:11,680 --> 01:18:17,060
Neisseria other Neisseria species can be part of a normal life. You don't worry about them at all.

662
01:18:17,060 --> 01:18:23,950
Marcella Kincardine colonized the upper respiratory tract, causing colonies colonized the female genital tract.

663
01:18:23,950 --> 01:18:38,330
And so this is the type of information that is in the charts. No, the mode of transmission and so on, which from whichever manual book you're using.

664
01:18:38,330 --> 01:18:42,320
Here's another example of the pathogenesis in the spectrum of disease.

665
01:18:42,320 --> 01:18:47,750
So let's talk about more cell first virulence factors. What we really don't know it's uncertain.

666
01:18:47,750 --> 01:18:56,390
So associated with a cell envelope will probably probably probably facilitate attachment to respiratory epithelial cells.

667
01:18:56,390 --> 01:19:01,490
And then it will tell you most infections are localized to sites associated with the respiratory tract,

668
01:19:01,490 --> 01:19:09,680
since that's where we think most of these infections happen can also cause sinusitis can cause pneumonia,

669
01:19:09,680 --> 01:19:17,360
and the lower respiratory tract infections oftentimes are much worse in older patients because they have

670
01:19:17,360 --> 01:19:25,310
more problems with lung function and also in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or cell.

671
01:19:25,310 --> 01:19:36,900
It generally doesn't present as a disseminated bacteremia or meningitis, but it can if it gets into the wrong patient.

672
01:19:36,900 --> 01:19:40,560
So I'm not going to spend time today reading this to you.

673
01:19:40,560 --> 01:19:45,390
You guys have it in front of you and you can also read it in the textbooks.

674
01:19:45,390 --> 01:19:51,390
But you should know the various the main pathogenic mechanisms and who how it's true.

675
01:19:51,390 --> 01:19:55,360
These organisms are transmitted kinds of diseases that are caused.

676
01:19:55,360 --> 01:20:07,000
And so. What about other Neisseria species, don't worry about them at all until somebody says, Oh, we've got a new one and it's causing this.

677
01:20:07,000 --> 01:20:10,030
So other than that, don't worry about the other Neisseria species,

678
01:20:10,030 --> 01:20:19,630
but many gonorrhea and then more solid generals are the very important ones, and more so I used to be in the nice serious.

679
01:20:19,630 --> 01:20:23,950
So here's a grandstand Neisseria of a specimen with Neisseria.

680
01:20:23,950 --> 01:20:27,700
And what do you see you see here?

681
01:20:27,700 --> 01:20:37,240
Lots of Poly's lots and lots and lots of Harleys and lots of gram negative duplicates, and you can actually see up at the top here.

682
01:20:37,240 --> 01:20:42,880
There's two of them side by side, difficult side, but see that pretty clearly, clearly.

683
01:20:42,880 --> 01:20:50,410
Well, what you would see, especially with a GC revenue engine, lots and lots of pollies and gram negative duplicate side.

684
01:20:50,410 --> 01:20:54,820
And if you saw this in my lab, it took a couple of years.

685
01:20:54,820 --> 01:21:05,470
Dr. Robinson But this is what I'm seeing. And I'd say, let's call the physician first and then let's report it out as heavy.

686
01:21:05,470 --> 01:21:15,640
If this was all over the side, heavy amount of pounds by heavy amount of ground and the difficulty level because we called them,

687
01:21:15,640 --> 01:21:24,960
they would know what we were thinking about, OK, particularly for spinal fluid or blood.

688
01:21:24,960 --> 01:21:32,730
OK, here's a more axilla. It looks suspiciously similar without all the white blood cells, of course.

689
01:21:32,730 --> 01:21:40,270
So more so, as I said, used to be part of my series until you split out.

690
01:21:40,270 --> 01:21:45,940
Lab diagnosis. What are we going to do? First thing, always going to get a specimen into the lab, right?

691
01:21:45,940 --> 01:21:52,520
So. We can just use a regular swab to collect the specimen for Marcela and put it in,

692
01:21:52,520 --> 01:22:01,730
transport me and get it to the to the laboratory, but pathogenic Neisseria are very picky about how they're handled in the house.

693
01:22:01,730 --> 01:22:07,490
You have to they're very susceptible to drying. They're very susceptible to temperature extremes.

694
01:22:07,490 --> 01:22:15,500
So if you have to transport this swab specimen, always, you always have to put it in transport media.

695
01:22:15,500 --> 01:22:25,190
But if it's transported in a vehicle, it is winter in Michigan. You know, it needs to not just be in the back of the van, that's not heated.

696
01:22:25,190 --> 01:22:31,550
So you take a lot of care there. If you want to do a culture for the nice, you're done over here.

697
01:22:31,550 --> 01:22:37,160
That works fine, but you have to get the squad interest transport media to the lab within six hours.

698
01:22:37,160 --> 01:22:48,200
So if it's coming from a doctor's office, that will be a staff pick up. And once again, see is here, gonorrhea.

699
01:22:48,200 --> 01:22:53,540
If it's body fluids, they have to be kept at room temperature and not before 37.

700
01:22:53,540 --> 01:23:03,920
Don't refrigerate them, OK? They cannot be cold before they get inoculated to media.

701
01:23:03,920 --> 01:23:12,230
If you have volume greater than one mil of serum or CSF or joint fluid can be concentrated by

702
01:23:12,230 --> 01:23:22,360
centrifugation and then you plate the sediment that will increase the positivity of your culture.

703
01:23:22,360 --> 01:23:29,950
Once again, we do a lot of direct detection for Neisseria gonorrhea, particularly for Neisseria species also.

704
01:23:29,950 --> 01:23:37,090
So they are gram negative depiction of side Neisseria and more more cells are bigger, they're fatter.

705
01:23:37,090 --> 01:23:41,830
But we can't say this is a more. Put it out in a report. OK, that's that.

706
01:23:41,830 --> 01:23:51,910
That would not work. So Neisseria or gram negative side large cells might be something that would be seen or there would be a call to the

707
01:23:51,910 --> 01:24:03,620
physician gram negative duplicate side in payments from the urethral discharge of a male is diagnosis of gonorrhea.

708
01:24:03,620 --> 01:24:08,510
Way back, way back in my undergraduate days in Boulder, Colorado, many,

709
01:24:08,510 --> 01:24:14,030
many years ago, I worked at the Boulder City County Free Clinic in different states,

710
01:24:14,030 --> 01:24:20,540
and we saw a lot of gonorrhea there and it was you could tell what it was, just from the Graham thing.

711
01:24:20,540 --> 01:24:33,260
Absolutely. So remember also the normal specimens from the vaginal and rectal flora may have a negative duplicate side,

712
01:24:33,260 --> 01:24:38,310
so you can't call it Neisseria gonorrhea just from a gram stain.

713
01:24:38,310 --> 01:24:45,380
You have to have confirmation, except for this one from a urethral discharge from a symptomatic male.

714
01:24:45,380 --> 01:24:52,770
That's only you can call characteristic for a Neisseria gonorrhea.

715
01:24:52,770 --> 01:25:02,130
So what about antigen detection now? No, don't don't do it, don't have your lab, do it for sensitivity, but the molecular methods are fabulous.

716
01:25:02,130 --> 01:25:11,160
Absolutely fabulous. They're more sensitive, as you would expect from the not amplified methods they have since they came on the market.

717
01:25:11,160 --> 01:25:17,670
They have increased the detection of gonorrhea at every site where they was thought you can.

718
01:25:17,670 --> 01:25:26,850
Oftentimes they're it's a test with you can also test for Chlamydia trachomatis at the same time, since the diseases are often very, very similar.

719
01:25:26,850 --> 01:25:35,790
And so with molecular tests, you get an identification for Neisseria gonorrhea and trachoma is whether or not they're they're here at Michigan.

720
01:25:35,790 --> 01:25:44,010
They use the BD Viper, which is an automated instrument at Beaumont, who use the Roche 40 800 both pairs of great great machines.

721
01:25:44,010 --> 01:25:51,790
They do molecular detection. I'm sure there are other machine equipment manufacturers who have just the automated test for molecular detection.

722
01:25:51,790 --> 01:25:57,350
I'm not pushing just these two, but high volume labs need to do something.

723
01:25:57,350 --> 01:26:02,430
Tell us what we expect to see this and want to go to automation.

724
01:26:02,430 --> 01:26:11,160
They need to do their fair projects, get more rapid results and you can be linked with the computer.

725
01:26:11,160 --> 01:26:17,550
This is just what the bomb the Viper looks like, and I've showed this before.

726
01:26:17,550 --> 01:26:25,920
OK, culture. So when we talk about a Democrat, so we have to consider this your meningitidis.

727
01:26:25,920 --> 01:26:30,060
I see going gonorrhea, Marcella and the Sapper phytic Neisseria.

728
01:26:30,060 --> 01:26:34,620
There are a lot of sap phytic Neisseria. They grow very well on blood on her and chop it out.

729
01:26:34,620 --> 01:26:40,260
So just because it's going on blood, a chocolate doesn't mean that it's a pathogen.

730
01:26:40,260 --> 01:26:46,650
The growing gonorrhea, you're concerned about gonorrhea, that a genital specimen,

731
01:26:46,650 --> 01:26:58,860
you have to have a rich chocolate outer while $12 enriched and you have to grow at thirty five to thirty seven with CO2 for up to 72 hours,

732
01:26:58,860 --> 01:27:01,350
you need some humidity in there also.

733
01:27:01,350 --> 01:27:14,490
We have selective media that will block growth of normal flora from the dental tract and from other sites and allow an engine to grow modified.

734
01:27:14,490 --> 01:27:20,580
Their environment has isolated legs to help support the growth of Neisseria species that has as antibiotics,

735
01:27:20,580 --> 01:27:31,200
colistin, nice down vancomycin and trimethoprim. Very good at inhibiting the growth of all that normal fly that you would find in those specimens.

736
01:27:31,200 --> 01:27:40,470
And then, of course, you need to know the texto know in the laboratory what the colonies look like chocolate or on top of their Martin Luther same.

737
01:27:40,470 --> 01:27:48,400
So here's. Well, you know, I didn't think about this, this is not a chocolate on a plate.

738
01:27:48,400 --> 01:28:00,540
So this is probably the culture of management because it will grow in blood and more juicy one that.

739
01:28:00,540 --> 01:28:05,670
And here's my theory on chocolate, I need to see the colonies are fairly large.

740
01:28:05,670 --> 01:28:14,940
It's not the greatest photograph of what I found and kind of shiny may have a little bit of a texture to it.

741
01:28:14,940 --> 01:28:20,840
And that's at a 48 hour incubation, you may not see anything at twenty four.

742
01:28:20,840 --> 01:28:26,660
Now, here's the mark, so it was very, very well and does not look like in vitro growth,

743
01:28:26,660 --> 01:28:39,440
does not look at all like you can separate it very easily from pathogenic Neisseria, whereby on a gravestone you cannot.

744
01:28:39,440 --> 01:28:49,750
OK, lab identification and detection. Neisseria and work still up for oxidase positive.

745
01:28:49,750 --> 01:28:58,660
So you start out when you got girl with colleagues that look typical. We started with an access test and you can set up biochemicals.

746
01:28:58,660 --> 01:29:06,790
It's usually in a test strip for fermentation of glucose, maltose and lactose in sexual abuse cases.

747
01:29:06,790 --> 01:29:08,710
I hate to talk about sexual abuse, but we have to.

748
01:29:08,710 --> 01:29:20,650
When we talk about these organisms sexual abuse cases, the identification must, must, must be confirmed because the case will hopefully go to court.

749
01:29:20,650 --> 01:29:24,230
There and there cannot be any ifs, ands or buts. Well, you know, what is it?

750
01:29:24,230 --> 01:29:28,840
No, it is or it isn't. And this is where you standardize methods.

751
01:29:28,840 --> 01:29:34,150
And we did this and this is what it turned out in our laboratories license the whole bit.

752
01:29:34,150 --> 01:29:39,980
We generally don't identify colonizers, as would be the non pathogenic Neisseria.

753
01:29:39,980 --> 01:29:44,200
They they can be present in respiratory cultures. We've got Neisseria, all of our bodies.

754
01:29:44,200 --> 01:29:52,840
So there is a risk because of that. We don't identify that if it's a in growth better than she does, if it's imminent, we have to serotype it.

755
01:29:52,840 --> 01:30:03,710
And the important serotypes are ABC and 135.

756
01:30:03,710 --> 01:30:12,380
What about susceptibility testing for more so generally don't do susceptibility testing officer, immunocompromised, patient, yes,

757
01:30:12,380 --> 01:30:17,900
everything will get suspect susceptibility testing, but generally not performed because there's so many options for therapy.

758
01:30:17,900 --> 01:30:23,060
The beta lactamase are available and they're available with beta lactamase inhibitors.

759
01:30:23,060 --> 01:30:32,720
Also cephalosporins, macrolides like you read through my son, the clindamycin, the quinolones and back of they'll work for GC.

760
01:30:32,720 --> 01:30:38,220
There's generally no Iceland because labs are using molecular methods for detection.

761
01:30:38,220 --> 01:30:46,910
So antimicrobial resistance is a huge issue and the it's a public health issue.

762
01:30:46,910 --> 01:30:54,050
If you give the patient the wrong drug, what will happen? They won't be cured of it and it will be transmitted.

763
01:30:54,050 --> 01:30:59,030
So we need to do susceptibility testing.

764
01:30:59,030 --> 01:31:05,060
So if we have a positive molecular test, set up a culture also, then we have an isolate.

765
01:31:05,060 --> 01:31:13,160
Cortisol resistance is widespread and Neisseria gonorrhea we haven't yet documented cept we have some resistance,

766
01:31:13,160 --> 01:31:19,130
but I'm sure it will show up eventually and put a little resistance is emerging.

767
01:31:19,130 --> 01:31:22,580
So we absolutely have to have an isolate for susceptibility testing now.

768
01:31:22,580 --> 01:31:31,190
Some of the molecular tests do have molecular determinants of resistance in them, but they don't have all the drugs.

769
01:31:31,190 --> 01:31:38,960
And then for oh, resistance is rare in Neisseria meningitidis, but I've read it can occur.

770
01:31:38,960 --> 01:31:53,280
Generally, patients are treated with penicillin or syphilis born. How do we prevent meningitis?

771
01:31:53,280 --> 01:32:00,360
The vaccine is wonderful. It's available for Serotypes AC 135.

772
01:32:00,360 --> 01:32:06,660
It's given to military recruits, college students and people who have no spleen and are better than two years old.

773
01:32:06,660 --> 01:32:14,910
OK. I assume everyone in this room has had eminent vaccine because I think you've Michigan is very strict on that.

774
01:32:14,910 --> 01:32:16,270
On that policy as they should be.

775
01:32:16,270 --> 01:32:24,960
There have been huge outbreaks in college dormitories in the past, but the the use of the vaccine has helped tremendously.

776
01:32:24,960 --> 01:32:34,800
If a patient is exposed to a person who has meningitis, they can be chemoprophylaxis with rifampin, ciprofloxacin or swift reaction.

777
01:32:34,800 --> 01:32:40,800
And this is for just for close contacts. Say a person in your family develop meningococcal meningitis.

778
01:32:40,800 --> 01:32:52,110
The family would be prophylaxis. There's no chemoprophylaxis for pneumococcal meningitis just for meningococcal and then neonates

779
01:32:52,110 --> 01:32:59,100
are given antibiotics or die to prevent gynecological infections just after they're born.

780
01:32:59,100 --> 01:33:08,070
They are delivered and they get the eye drops. And that's standard across the United States and many other countries also.

781
01:33:08,070 --> 01:33:10,830
So we're almost to the end,

782
01:33:10,830 --> 01:33:23,710
which organism is the most common kinds of gastritis in the United States and may result in Guillain-Barre syndrome as a post-infection complication?

783
01:33:23,710 --> 01:33:35,460
Bingo. Which method is becoming the new gold standard for detection of Bordetella?

784
01:33:35,460 --> 01:33:44,820
PCR, PCR, PCR, PCR, yes. And that was the end of this lecture, we just got through a hundred slides.

I felt like I was talking very rapidly. I'm sorry about that. But we did it at six o'clock right now, so I thank you all for your attention.

01:33:55,770 --> 01:34:08,710
If you have any questions, let me know and I will see you on Wednesday. I'm sorry.

01:34:08,710 --> 01:34:15,640
We'll leave it there, and I will try and get them done. I've got some things going on with my family right now, but I will try.

01:34:15,640 --> 01:34:46,500
That'll be Monday. OK, thank you. Yep. Sorry.

789
01:34:46,500 --> 01:34:51,659
Yeah, I just need to go. I just need to.
