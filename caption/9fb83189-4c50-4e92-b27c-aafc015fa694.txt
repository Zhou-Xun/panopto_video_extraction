1
00:00:09,400 --> 00:00:14,170
So as we learned, the federal government has grown into a larger stakeholder in public health.

2
00:00:14,830 --> 00:00:21,910
Let's have a look at some of the federal agencies that are responsible for public health that make up that significant role of the federal government.

3
00:00:22,900 --> 00:00:29,230
I think it's best to start with one of the federal government's largest departments, and that's the Department of Health and Human Services.

4
00:00:29,770 --> 00:00:36,610
This, of course, is housed inside of the executive branch and the department is headed by the Secretary of Health and Human Services,

5
00:00:36,940 --> 00:00:40,570
who is nominated by the President and then confirmed by the US Senate.

6
00:00:41,380 --> 00:00:46,510
If you take a look here, you can see an organizational chart of the Department of Health and Human Services.

7
00:00:46,840 --> 00:00:54,010
And as you can see, there are various administrators and assistant secretaries that oversee federal involvement in public health.

8
00:00:54,550 --> 00:01:01,150
They make up what we call the US Public Health Service, which is the focal point for health concerns at the federal level,

9
00:01:01,420 --> 00:01:06,730
and addresses a wide range of activities from research to training to surveillance.

10
00:01:07,630 --> 00:01:13,540
You might be familiar with some of these agencies, not with others, but let's take a few minutes to review them.

11
00:01:14,860 --> 00:01:20,770
The Health Resource and Services Administration provides resources for medically underserved populations.

12
00:01:21,340 --> 00:01:25,300
It's work is involved in overseeing the organ transplantation system.

13
00:01:25,540 --> 00:01:29,950
It's working to decrease infant mortality, improving maternal and child health.

14
00:01:31,150 --> 00:01:38,080
The Indian Health Service is responsible for providing federal health services to Native American and Alaska Natives.

15
00:01:39,370 --> 00:01:43,090
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, or the CDC,

16
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:49,930
works with states and other partners to provide a system of health surveillance to monitor and prevent disease outbreaks.

17
00:01:50,350 --> 00:01:57,130
This might also include bioterrorism threats. The CDC also maintains national health statistics.

18
00:01:57,310 --> 00:02:02,050
It provides immunization services. It supports research into disease and injury.

19
00:02:02,290 --> 00:02:05,770
And prevents and guards against international disease transmission.

20
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:10,590
If you think about an example, if you come down with the flu, which I hope you would not,

21
00:02:11,140 --> 00:02:15,160
the CDC would record this as part of its surveillance responsibilities.

22
00:02:16,420 --> 00:02:22,810
The National Institutes of Health or now H. Is responsible for medical and behavioral research for the United States.

23
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:29,620
The NIH encompasses 27 separate health institutes and is headquartered in Bethesda, Maryland.

24
00:02:30,100 --> 00:02:36,640
The NIH has more than 16,000 employees who all work on research designed to improve health and wellness.

25
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:42,250
Another one that you might be familiar with is the Food and Drug Administration, or FDA.

26
00:02:42,670 --> 00:02:46,510
This one's responsible for ensuring that all the food we're eating is safe,

27
00:02:46,690 --> 00:02:53,050
that the cosmetics we use are not going to harm us, and that medications and medical devices are safe and effective.

28
00:02:53,980 --> 00:03:00,280
A new agency called the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration was established in 1992.

29
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:08,530
This was established to strengthen the nation's health care capacity to prevent, diagnose and treat substance abuse and mental illness.

30
00:03:09,430 --> 00:03:14,169
The Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry works with other states and

31
00:03:14,170 --> 00:03:19,450
other federal agencies to prevent exposure to hazardous substances from waste sites.

32
00:03:20,050 --> 00:03:24,070
Finally, the Agency for Health Care Research and Quality, or H.R.

33
00:03:24,070 --> 00:03:31,390
Q This agency is supporting innovative research on health care systems, health care quality and cost issues.

34
00:03:31,690 --> 00:03:38,020
And taking a look at how to effectively provide medical treatment and what the effectiveness of different interventions are.

35
00:03:38,980 --> 00:03:42,940
While these agencies may sound like they are responsible for a lot,

36
00:03:43,570 --> 00:03:48,670
they actually only represent a small part of the Department of Health and Human Services.

37
00:03:49,150 --> 00:03:52,690
And there are a lot of other important divisions inside of HHS,

38
00:03:52,690 --> 00:03:58,420
Department of Health and Human Services that include the Administration for Children and Families.

39
00:03:58,750 --> 00:04:03,940
The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. And the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Aging.

40
00:04:04,690 --> 00:04:11,740
Beyond the Department of Health and Human Services, public health responsibilities are actually spread in all kinds of other federal agencies.

41
00:04:12,190 --> 00:04:19,660
The Environmental Protection Agency handles health care related needs that connect to protecting the environment and different resources.

42
00:04:20,290 --> 00:04:24,610
The Department of Homeland Security has a role to play in public health delivery.

43
00:04:25,270 --> 00:04:34,089
And if you think about the Department of Veterans Affairs, its responsibility is nested inside of its role to help our veterans and

44
00:04:34,090 --> 00:04:38,980
military families deliver health care and receive the services that they need.

45
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:48,300
The federal government is the largest purchaser of health related services, and this represents about one fourth of the federal budget.

46
00:04:49,110 --> 00:04:50,310
So as you can see,

47
00:04:50,580 --> 00:04:59,639
the federal government has expanded its involvement in a wide range of health related services and offerings and continues to see an evolving

48
00:04:59,640 --> 00:05:07,590
role where it becomes larger and larger in delivering public health and acting as an important stakeholder in our public health system.
