1
00:00:01,170 --> 00:00:08,010
Know, I was very lucky.

2
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:27,780
I was very lucky. I would still write a disclaimer to Curb Your Enthusiasm for Gay.

3
00:00:29,310 --> 00:00:36,780
I don't want to give up my bag.

4
00:00:37,260 --> 00:00:41,160
I don't look like you're old. Thanks for looking out for me.

5
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:44,850
Let's see. I'll go. 36 years.

6
00:00:45,660 --> 00:00:50,240
I don't want something that I've that away.

7
00:00:51,140 --> 00:01:18,380
Because the idea that we all feel like, oh, you don't know everything and there is nothing.

8
00:01:20,030 --> 00:01:26,920
So you find something very useful.

9
00:01:27,670 --> 00:01:37,410
But I think someone I you to focus on some things.

10
00:01:38,340 --> 00:01:41,490
Yes. Okay. Let's get started.

11
00:01:42,570 --> 00:01:47,220
We only have two more classes left and don't mean to say it's all good.

12
00:01:47,310 --> 00:01:55,140
You guys are moving on to bigger and better things. It's going to be great. Next week, we will have a guest speaker.

13
00:01:55,560 --> 00:02:03,930
He is the senior director of benefits for the University of Michigan, coming to talk to and share with you guys from our human resources department.

14
00:02:04,260 --> 00:02:10,469
So as prior to with previous guests, please come in.

15
00:02:10,470 --> 00:02:18,180
Person is what I'm looking for. Knowing Michigan, it's a beautiful day today, but next week it could be like five feet of snow.

16
00:02:18,510 --> 00:02:27,540
So if it's bad, bad weather for next Thursday, I am willing to do this class and he is willing to do this class virtual.

17
00:02:27,750 --> 00:02:33,750
Just show your work because winter for Michigan you know what I'm talking about so just doesn't fly.

18
00:02:35,670 --> 00:02:38,910
So again two classes next class class will end with benefits.

19
00:02:39,150 --> 00:02:40,920
You saw the infographic design.

20
00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:49,470
He will actually be not talking specifically about that, but really talking about benefits and how the University of Michigan designs,

21
00:02:49,770 --> 00:02:56,810
monitors, tracks, and engages with the 51,000 employees that we manage and our other qualifying adults.

22
00:02:57,270 --> 00:03:03,090
So I just want to give you that. I'm going to keep the music on while we do this.

23
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:09,960
So that will be fun because this is my kind of my last lecture with you and I enjoyed fun stuff like this.

24
00:03:10,410 --> 00:03:17,470
So I'm going to scroll down and there's going to be a couple of words that you can make new words from.

25
00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:28,110
Right. They need to be at least three, three letters long, not just two things, three letters long.

26
00:03:28,530 --> 00:03:34,440
And the winner, if you it's completely up to you.

27
00:03:35,100 --> 00:03:38,429
I do not want to force anybody into doing this, but if you would like,

28
00:03:38,430 --> 00:03:46,130
the winner will get a $5 scratcher and you can win up to $500,000 just on your own.

29
00:03:51,010 --> 00:03:59,840
The Guard and I have a fun little game that I and I've gotten actually from u h r that we'll go with if it's a tie.

30
00:04:00,260 --> 00:04:05,510
I bought two of those. So I want to have you make you write, you make or break the tie.

31
00:04:05,510 --> 00:04:09,860
I'll just get down to $5 myself and have fun.

32
00:04:09,860 --> 00:04:14,290
And so for those online, I'm going to scroll down.

33
00:04:14,300 --> 00:04:17,570
It's up to you now. I will be timing this.

34
00:04:18,960 --> 00:04:29,180
You know, I'll go to the my time.

35
00:04:29,180 --> 00:04:37,370
Let's see what he says.

36
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:45,380
Okay. We're all we don't get that money. I want to you take a scratch.

37
00:04:48,090 --> 00:04:52,070
All right. All right.

38
00:04:54,690 --> 00:05:00,980
I could write. I right know.

39
00:05:01,140 --> 00:05:14,760
I told you I was looking for my problems. So what? I think that's going to be good for me.

40
00:05:16,190 --> 00:05:29,800
Yeah. Let's dial which one? That's not on 73424910260.

41
00:05:30,020 --> 00:05:34,280
You're problem 7342491026.

42
00:05:34,640 --> 00:05:43,220
Yeah, it's a drag under that white back waistband.

43
00:05:43,700 --> 00:05:50,870
So I have to tell you, I used to never forget them.

44
00:05:50,870 --> 00:05:54,800
Thank you. Thank you. Okay. All right.

45
00:05:54,890 --> 00:05:59,760
Those online. Give me a thumbs up if you're ready. Everybody in class.

46
00:05:59,760 --> 00:06:05,130
Ready? Very good. Okay, so he just walked in the side speak.

47
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:09,810
So this is the icebreaker for today.

48
00:06:10,230 --> 00:06:18,060
I last class them and have a little bit fun with you. The winner will get a $5 scratcher in a small little game.

49
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:27,990
The words that I am displaying what you need to write needs to be at least three letters long and the person who comes up with the most in 3 minutes.

50
00:06:29,790 --> 00:06:34,800
So. All right, so we get my little dreamer here.

51
00:06:35,190 --> 00:06:46,340
We lost the music. Okay, are we ready? The music blazing loud, just like.

52
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:51,750
There it goes. Okay. Hey. Thank you.

53
00:06:53,430 --> 00:06:59,850
All right, in three, two, one.

54
00:07:01,540 --> 00:07:04,950
Go. Oh, no, no. But their letters.

55
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:09,220
We can use the letters. You can make the word man. You can make the word here.

56
00:07:09,220 --> 00:07:13,000
You can make. Yeah, just using those letters.

57
00:07:13,390 --> 00:07:17,700
But the letters and none of them sends just words. Three.

58
00:07:18,010 --> 00:07:25,390
Can we use any other. Any word? Any. Any of those letters are totally plausible for you to make a word, a new word.

59
00:07:26,590 --> 00:07:35,890
A word, and. Someone.

60
00:07:41,130 --> 00:07:47,790
Do those words count? I think the question the answer is yes.

61
00:07:48,520 --> 00:07:58,320
We've all got to move. We'll take them and I'll let you know when it's 30 seconds.

62
00:08:01,870 --> 00:08:13,490
Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

63
00:08:19,090 --> 00:08:24,570
You are short of time. But if you'd like to participate, you can win in 5 hours from now.

64
00:08:25,230 --> 00:08:29,290
Are on the screen. How many words can you make those words?

65
00:08:30,310 --> 00:08:34,420
Everybody's doing it. It's like rearranging the letters.

66
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:39,460
Just make a word. How many words can you have?

67
00:08:39,940 --> 00:08:50,110
You're going to get 3 minutes. You now have 2 minutes. Oh.

68
00:08:57,910 --> 00:09:16,640
So. One minute.

69
00:09:23,160 --> 00:09:28,620
My city board in Hanover has the selection of a commercial market for your car.

70
00:09:29,520 --> 00:09:37,730
It also has the best hours shopping, including on Mondays and Thursdays.

71
00:09:37,740 --> 00:09:44,100
And not just one stop on your first evening.

72
00:09:44,530 --> 00:09:52,259
Hi, baby girl. We're all doing the ice breaker, so I'm going to have to let you not participate.

73
00:09:52,260 --> 00:09:55,740
So you should. All right, you got 30 seconds.

74
00:09:55,860 --> 00:10:07,390
It can be expensive on all our student loan cost plans for your budget.

75
00:10:07,560 --> 00:10:11,850
We want a machine to help in finding insurance with great cleansing clinics like

76
00:10:12,450 --> 00:10:16,589
preventive care and mental health coverage included with health insurance.

77
00:10:16,590 --> 00:10:27,060
That opens as you and your wallet covered it in five, four, three, two, one.

78
00:10:27,090 --> 00:10:31,130
Hands up, everybody. Hands up. Got to make that happen.

79
00:10:31,140 --> 00:10:42,990
Okay. And for those online, no cheating honor code. Okay, so count your words, please sum up your words for those online.

80
00:10:43,020 --> 00:10:49,139
Can you put it in chat? Oh, wow. Somebody actually go, oh, hey, you dropping that?

81
00:10:49,140 --> 00:10:52,650
I see what I ran.

82
00:10:52,830 --> 00:10:58,770
Okay. Count your words, Brand, and then tell me how many you have for everybody else online.

83
00:10:58,770 --> 00:11:01,790
Just tell me how many you have as a number in ten.

84
00:11:03,330 --> 00:11:08,900
So can I play game? All right.

85
00:11:10,500 --> 00:11:14,400
Why not let me have at least 20?

86
00:11:15,730 --> 00:11:18,780
Hey, just keep your hand up until I get to the number where you got to put it down.

87
00:11:19,560 --> 00:11:24,840
How many have at least 30 or 35?

88
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:30,420

89
00:11:30,810 --> 00:11:34,440

Yeah. Hi. Okay. All right. 45.

Do you want 50? 54 TV? Okay.

00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:07,559
Thanks for doing this or we just got lost some words you got our and yeah those next one check

00:12:26,760 --> 00:12:31,460
All right. All right. 49.

98
00:12:31,700 --> 00:12:35,519
I have 52. You have 52. You have 50?

99
00:12:35,520 --> 00:12:42,990
Yeah. It took me a while to come. I kept losing my nose.

100
00:12:43,140 --> 00:12:48,110
Oh, yeah. I got to do this.

101
00:12:52,010 --> 00:12:59,140
All right. $5 scratch off, and this is a little.

102
00:12:59,840 --> 00:13:05,490
So our university human resources was giving out things to make people positive about feelings.

103
00:13:05,900 --> 00:13:20,160
And you can share what it is when you open it up. We want to share with you guys if you want to know where we all go at lunch.

104
00:13:20,660 --> 00:13:24,020
Do you have regulations on that? No.

105
00:13:25,700 --> 00:13:30,050
Interesting. It's the little thingy.

106
00:13:30,500 --> 00:13:33,670
Cornhole desk. Cornhole. Really?

107
00:13:36,290 --> 00:13:39,710
All right. Thank you for playing. Everybody. Totally cliched it.

108
00:13:41,090 --> 00:13:48,860
Okay, if you want anything, it's the real things you want to try to make.

109
00:13:51,960 --> 00:13:59,360
You want it to be in order.

110
00:14:01,030 --> 00:14:04,970
I'm exhausted. You don't have a pen and paper.

111
00:14:06,440 --> 00:14:11,120
How do you know that? I don't know. You want to do a splitter?

112
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:22,890
That's my goal. I mean, I don't want to hear it.

113
00:14:24,410 --> 00:14:33,290
Oh, no, no. I mean, you wanted to know that.

114
00:14:37,130 --> 00:14:45,680
I guess I just.

115
00:14:48,060 --> 00:15:03,530
I guess for those that are online.

116
00:15:03,560 --> 00:15:30,020
Can you see the presentation that you and your colleagues will be shut out if you want something?

117
00:15:33,140 --> 00:15:38,180
That's why we're scratching.

118
00:15:38,210 --> 00:15:42,950
So I'm going to wait to see. I'm just excited as you are.

119
00:15:45,560 --> 00:15:51,110
You know, it's it's a little intense.

120
00:15:51,320 --> 00:15:55,850
Don't want you see it. Can you get the legs?

121
00:15:56,000 --> 00:16:04,130
Yeah, I've. Oh.

122
00:16:06,330 --> 00:16:09,540
You got that? So there you go.

123
00:16:12,440 --> 00:16:18,110
Your love of money. Okay, well, think again. Thinking of 2010 as my last lecture.

124
00:16:18,110 --> 00:16:22,760
You guys have been a great class. Next. Like I said, next week you're going to have a guest speaker.

125
00:16:23,210 --> 00:16:32,150
So when we started this journey, I asked a couple of questions and wanted to set the foundation about human resources,

126
00:16:32,150 --> 00:16:37,220
and so does the human resource management systems.

127
00:16:37,850 --> 00:16:46,010
And looking at things internally around what what are we stupid within our department and what are the things that they need to consider.

128
00:16:46,430 --> 00:16:57,680
But there's also and you heard from Denise Stegall about systems that support H.R. thinking a little bit outside of the facility and realm of the

129
00:16:57,980 --> 00:17:06,709
H.R. department and what kind of what methods and thoughts that are happening from the business leader and others that need to help support H.R.,

130
00:17:06,710 --> 00:17:13,850
do the work that they do because they are internally working through the process around who they are, what they are, what the chip provides.

131
00:17:14,120 --> 00:17:26,660
So this is kind of give going to sort of give you some methods, tips and tools for when and you heard me say many times when you become that leader,

132
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:31,280
some of the things that you can think about as you engage from your unit, your department,

133
00:17:31,290 --> 00:17:39,379
what you're doing through H.R. and how you can support or how how the alignment of thinking from your area firm should be.

134
00:17:39,380 --> 00:17:46,290
So trying to tie a little bit all together and then next week sort of leave you with just we go forward,

135
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:48,979
think about your benefit package, things about think about the impact,

136
00:17:48,980 --> 00:17:55,400
think about those that you're managing and the benefits that they have and why it's important

137
00:17:55,400 --> 00:18:01,280
to really have that in your knowledge base and sharing that with your employees so that again,

138
00:18:01,580 --> 00:18:08,090
they can become quality employees who are always trying to figure out how to be healthy going forward.

139
00:18:08,090 --> 00:18:19,100
So what you heard before so I'm on the right screens here, you've seen this screen before because this was way, way, way back up in September.

140
00:18:19,340 --> 00:18:26,300
So like a lifetime ago, the H.R. Human Resource Management performance and it's definition.

141
00:18:27,080 --> 00:18:34,819
Right, will not sort of read that to you, but it's it was important to say when we think about the internal human resources,

142
00:18:34,820 --> 00:18:40,850
this is this is the performance that they're trying to sort of coddle and work through so

143
00:18:40,850 --> 00:18:45,860
that they are as effective as they can be and then having the impact that they need to have.

144
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:53,150
And you've seen this one before as well. And this is just setting the context for the day, which is the practices and processes.

145
00:18:53,150 --> 00:19:01,639
Right, that that really sort of drive those goals, that internal strategic direction for human resources,

146
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:06,860
the planning, the staffing, the performance management, the AI an employee will be.

147
00:19:06,860 --> 00:19:13,009
And then again on sort of the right are just some of the some of the thoughts about those particular areas.

148
00:19:13,010 --> 00:19:16,970
And again, we've sort of gone over these before. You just wanted again, set the context.

149
00:19:17,570 --> 00:19:25,400
So getting into sort of the meat of this presentation, H.R. again plays a strategic role in business management.

150
00:19:26,540 --> 00:19:34,909
It just sits at the table, is at leadership. And so thinking through when they're at the table, who else is at the table?

151
00:19:34,910 --> 00:19:38,650
Who else is hearing that voice? Who else is engaging in that voice?

152
00:19:38,930 --> 00:19:47,870
We know that the mission and visions are set from a group of core leaders in an employer and.

153
00:19:49,170 --> 00:20:02,130
It's important for us to know that the implementation and workplace culture is also a huge factor in which plays a strategic role.

154
00:20:02,460 --> 00:20:06,630
And again, it's a factor that can contribute significantly to the country's overall success.

155
00:20:06,630 --> 00:20:12,450
And in trying to sort of demonstrate that a little bit throughout the class as a department.

156
00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:18,800
H.R. takes care of those following, in my mind, those following areas.

157
00:20:20,060 --> 00:20:22,850
And look, we've talked about employee motivation.

158
00:20:22,860 --> 00:20:29,930
What would you that compensation and benefits, recruitment, organizational development safety employee relations and training.

159
00:20:30,590 --> 00:20:34,890
So. Want to pause here for a second.

160
00:20:35,910 --> 00:20:42,390
If you're reading the Becker's report, if not link to it, find it great information.

161
00:20:43,320 --> 00:20:48,360
How many are aware that just recently 14 hospital CEOs.

162
00:20:50,260 --> 00:20:54,610
Excellent. Literally left their jobs.

163
00:20:55,150 --> 00:21:00,040
There's another one, another CEO that I just saw leaving.

164
00:21:02,200 --> 00:21:06,460
Wondering what I had to do. Wonder what the culture of that place had.

165
00:21:07,240 --> 00:21:12,760
What was the culture that literally let those CEOs walk out the door?

166
00:21:13,240 --> 00:21:16,480
What would it have been? What would it take for you?

167
00:21:16,660 --> 00:21:19,860
What's not there for you to support you?

168
00:21:20,410 --> 00:21:29,170
14. That's a that's a I mean, there's a lot of health care systems going wrong, but 14 is a number to stand up and say what's what's going on?

169
00:21:29,170 --> 00:21:33,040
What's the culture in that organization? You know, is it they're bored?

170
00:21:34,390 --> 00:21:38,410
Is it staff complaining? Is it the leadership ousting, not wanting?

171
00:21:38,530 --> 00:21:44,830
What is what is it? And how did H.R. kind of play a role in that?

172
00:21:45,670 --> 00:21:54,880
In addition to just looking at several employers health care systems,

173
00:21:55,120 --> 00:22:02,949
heavily investing in their staff, whether it's nurses for nurses care and payroll,

174
00:22:02,950 --> 00:22:08,530
having to go through H.R. and looking at all those numbers that we sort of talked about earlier as well,

175
00:22:09,910 --> 00:22:17,379
just thinking through who's at that table, proving that with H.R., what other systems are out there.

176
00:22:17,380 --> 00:22:21,940
We know payrolls aren't there. But when you think about the other the other leaders at the table, who's there.

177
00:22:23,290 --> 00:22:26,290
So I'm begging the question to you.

178
00:22:29,820 --> 00:22:33,750
You are the CEO of your own health care system. Congratulations.

179
00:22:35,580 --> 00:22:42,930
Would you. Instead in-house your human resources or outsource your human resources?

180
00:22:44,040 --> 00:22:49,710
And why or why not? Would you would you want to do that?

181
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:54,090
I'm a split the room in half we just had was.

182
00:22:54,100 --> 00:23:02,430
Yeah, I'm going to take this group of CEOs and say, you want to outsource your human resources.

183
00:23:03,700 --> 00:23:07,620
Give you a minute to think about it. So, you know, on this side, I'm going to keep it in-house.

184
00:23:08,040 --> 00:23:11,130
What are you. What are you telling your executives?

185
00:23:11,790 --> 00:23:15,180
To keep it or to lose it?

186
00:23:19,320 --> 00:23:23,010
What is the purpose of having it? Why have it?

187
00:23:23,580 --> 00:23:27,480
Why not human resources? Why not?

188
00:23:29,290 --> 00:23:33,320
All right. My own site.

189
00:23:35,750 --> 00:23:41,060
I think if you're outsourcing H.R., then maybe it helps to have them be like a very neutral party.

190
00:23:41,330 --> 00:23:45,470
I know there are supposed to be neutral, you know, when there's conflict or any sort of issue.

191
00:23:46,250 --> 00:23:49,760
HRC seems to be sort of the, you know, the mediator in those instances.

192
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:55,850
But I feel like if they're outsourced, then they can be like relief neutral as opposed to neutral, maybe.

193
00:23:56,320 --> 00:24:02,510
Okay. If I ask you, you have to decide.

194
00:24:03,330 --> 00:24:07,710
HRC fate. What comes to mind.

195
00:24:09,870 --> 00:24:13,140
I do perspective. But again, from the new perspective.

196
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:24,579
New perspective. I say you depend on how big we are and sort of what is our sort of long term strategic goals.

197
00:24:24,580 --> 00:24:30,250
Are we trying to be like a premier institution that will just attract a lot of great talent?

198
00:24:30,250 --> 00:24:33,010
And if so, it would make a lot of sense to have it be in-house.

199
00:24:33,550 --> 00:24:39,520
But if we are a very small organization where financially we're not as well equipped to have an in-house one,

200
00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:44,770
we can then just really be very particular in how we go about outsourcing within where

201
00:24:44,770 --> 00:24:49,209
there is at least maybe an in-person contact that could be a liaison between the two.

202
00:24:49,210 --> 00:24:55,300
So I think it just depends on what the priorities are, what we can actually accomplish and what we want to accomplish down the road.

203
00:24:55,840 --> 00:25:00,520
Okay. So you're now the CEO and you have all that data. Then what do I mean?

204
00:25:01,480 --> 00:25:05,050
Are we a big place? Okay, let's assume we're a big place where we are.

205
00:25:05,230 --> 00:25:09,940
We want to be a premier location. Then I think it is best to then have to be in-house.

206
00:25:12,190 --> 00:25:18,549
The reasons that I mentioned just a little earlier than the reasons you may hear a little bit.

207
00:25:18,550 --> 00:25:31,510
I'm from this from this group. Yeah, I agree with I think in terms of recruitment especially, it's important to have you for or against.

208
00:25:32,440 --> 00:25:37,330
Well, I thought we were I thought this site was supposed to be for. Yeah. So the site is.

209
00:25:38,430 --> 00:25:42,050
This race that you guys are outsourcing. You guys are in-house.

210
00:25:42,270 --> 00:25:49,210
Okay. So you felt like you're an argument to keep it in-house, depending on what the priorities are?

211
00:25:49,230 --> 00:25:55,559
Yeah. Well, no outsourcing, you know.

212
00:25:55,560 --> 00:25:59,070
Yes. In-house. Yes. So I guess I'm on the wrong side. Okay.

213
00:26:00,390 --> 00:26:08,210
I'll get with you once I. I think in regard to outsourcing, which is a good point, but I think it's better to outsource.

214
00:26:08,220 --> 00:26:15,959
I should get that neutral kind of view is if you have an in-house, you might already have connections with certain members in the organization.

215
00:26:15,960 --> 00:26:23,880
So you're going to be able to probably the more human we're going to like want to lean towards one way or another versus if it's a outsource,

216
00:26:23,880 --> 00:26:29,880
it's like you don't have those personal connections. You can kind of just look at the numbers and make a decision in that way.

217
00:26:29,910 --> 00:26:33,780
Kind of like consultants, in a way. It's kind of interesting.

218
00:26:35,190 --> 00:26:43,090
Yeah. For you were in house group and I get it.

219
00:26:43,100 --> 00:26:48,100
But I can make an argument for a house or if you want me to. Let's do it because I clearly got it.

220
00:26:48,820 --> 00:26:52,640
I mean, there are certain tasks that make sense to outsource.

221
00:26:52,660 --> 00:27:05,080
If there's a company that solely does H.R. and they are excellent at payroll benefits, advising you on compensation strategies and things like that.

222
00:27:05,410 --> 00:27:11,569
Then. Why have your company, which is not an h.r.

223
00:27:11,570 --> 00:27:16,450
Company, focus on h.r those those types of tasks with nature.

224
00:27:16,940 --> 00:27:20,299
So I think there are certain tasks within the purview of h.r.

225
00:27:20,300 --> 00:27:24,560
That could be outsourced effectively. All right.

226
00:27:24,650 --> 00:27:27,800
Any other thoughts from either side now that i got myself confused?

227
00:27:31,780 --> 00:27:34,280
I think kind of like a hybrid between the two can be really good.

228
00:27:34,360 --> 00:27:40,150
Like, one thing I like to do, like one of the places I worked was that you didn't go into like an eight hour person got a question instead of email.

229
00:27:40,660 --> 00:27:44,100
You just like ask H.R. and you never knew who was going to respond.

230
00:27:44,110 --> 00:27:51,249
So there there's like no bias like you got. But then also like it was up like like you feel like it's someone who understands the organization,

231
00:27:51,250 --> 00:27:53,319
like when you go when you have an issue or something like that.

232
00:27:53,320 --> 00:28:00,760
Because I can see from like an employee perspective, if it's someone who's outsourced, what if they deal with a bunch of other company is different?

233
00:28:01,120 --> 00:28:07,600
Some are bigger, some are smaller. They might not understand exactly what you are saying, and so that could feel unauthentic.

234
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:12,879
But then also like it could be way more cost effective and kind of what it is saying,

235
00:28:12,880 --> 00:28:18,490
like if you get I just get like they're specialized that you can get a better price and a better

236
00:28:18,490 --> 00:28:23,050
bang for the buck for saving my lose some of that authenticity that employees are looking for.

237
00:28:25,450 --> 00:28:31,419
Yeah similar that's what's we're. I guess one pro from outsourcing could be that this company may have other clients

238
00:28:31,420 --> 00:28:36,430
like they have that perspective of what's working for other places of similar size.

239
00:28:36,670 --> 00:28:43,230
So maybe they could use what they know, like what's working and what's being productive about their other clients to then be like.

240
00:28:48,480 --> 00:29:00,210
So for team in-house, I would say like if you have it in-house, then those employees are making decisions based on your special vision values.

241
00:29:00,300 --> 00:29:06,990
Or if you outsource, they're not doing that. And then also, if they're in-house, hopefully that means they're physically present.

242
00:29:07,260 --> 00:29:11,310
So they're able to handle issues quicker and they're accessible.

243
00:29:11,640 --> 00:29:18,660
And I think employees would be more comfortable coming to someone that they see and that they know is constantly

244
00:29:19,740 --> 00:29:25,680
like wanting to do right by them as close to like this external entity that you don't really hear from.

245
00:29:25,680 --> 00:29:32,370
And it's just doing the bare minimum. Okay. Neither does support for what was stated.

246
00:29:34,770 --> 00:29:39,599
Oh, I agree. That's a good point. Very good.

247
00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:45,510
Very good. So can those C.E.O.s go to H.R.?

248
00:29:50,160 --> 00:29:54,630
Should those CEOs have gone to H.R.? Did those CEOs go to H.R.?

249
00:29:56,400 --> 00:30:00,140
Let me bring it home just a little bit closer for you, Mark.

250
00:30:00,180 --> 00:30:08,940
Listen, these are real, real, real life applications right here.

251
00:30:10,320 --> 00:30:21,740
Do you think H.R. was involved? In one of the circumstances you might be talking about there is the CEO of Metro Health was let go for,

252
00:30:21,740 --> 00:30:30,620
I think a number of reasons, but the board was looking for a replacement CEO for him because his retirement was coming up soon.

253
00:30:30,620 --> 00:30:36,980
And as they asked H.R. to look into his compensation data so that they could recruit another CEO.

254
00:30:37,670 --> 00:30:47,060
It found that he had approved almost $2 million himself for himself, which was pretty unethical.

255
00:30:47,900 --> 00:30:53,840
So he was let go? Yeah, I was watching. It was monitoring who's engaged with it.

256
00:30:53,840 --> 00:30:58,160
And that's an H.R. department that was asked to do that work.

257
00:30:59,610 --> 00:31:04,230
Was finance at the table. Check in all of these bonuses, checks and balances.

258
00:31:04,280 --> 00:31:07,010
Who else benefited from that? I'd be looking for the trickle down.

259
00:31:08,200 --> 00:31:19,930
Just going to say, but I'm trying to put this in front of you because your awareness expands your awareness of what's happening around you.

260
00:31:20,440 --> 00:31:27,430
How is your H.R. involved or not involved for the University of Michigan to outsource its H.R. department?

261
00:31:30,400 --> 00:31:34,930
From Metro Health to have outsourced their human resource department.

262
00:31:36,620 --> 00:31:43,849
There are transactional. And I will go back to the very beginning when we talked about transactional air being very direct.

263
00:31:43,850 --> 00:31:56,510
That is an absolute true statement. Payroll, Paychex, PPA was CHC X is a great company and I do agree that depending on size,

264
00:31:57,890 --> 00:32:02,660
if a lot of transactional work, depending on the size of your organization can be moved.

265
00:32:04,850 --> 00:32:10,670
But then there's a human resource aspect of you thinking about your people.

266
00:32:11,970 --> 00:32:23,160
Because what will happen when you outsource a lot of your human resources is you become you specifically become human resources.

267
00:32:27,090 --> 00:32:33,270
Managing a cancer center, infectious disease and Travel Medicine Clinic.

268
00:32:34,500 --> 00:32:42,840
There were 13 physicians, six nurses, ten chemo chairs, seven EMS, five billers.

269
00:32:45,300 --> 00:32:51,840
Etc., etc. And we outsourced human resources transactional.

270
00:32:53,070 --> 00:32:57,210
Now there was conflict of interest because one building didn't like the other.

271
00:32:57,990 --> 00:33:06,240
There's a conflict of interest between a discriminatory situation that the physician did something to the nurse.

272
00:33:06,570 --> 00:33:11,440
The nurse against nurse. Where are they going to go to?

273
00:33:11,760 --> 00:33:16,990
Who were they going to talk to? They could just leave.

274
00:33:19,390 --> 00:33:22,870
They came here and quickly.

275
00:33:22,960 --> 00:33:28,330
You are going to learn your tolerance for conflict.

276
00:33:29,290 --> 00:33:37,090
Conflict conversations. What the laws are, what the rules are when you outsource.

277
00:33:39,380 --> 00:33:48,650
When you try to have one or two individuals, depending on size, that stay and that have been designated as a human resource person.

278
00:33:50,130 --> 00:33:54,450
You get to have that third party view. Someone who can mediate,

279
00:33:54,630 --> 00:34:05,670
someone who can be there for you and tell you the laws and the rules of the way have to learn depending on where you're going and what you're doing.

280
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:13,079
I asked you look at each other and how they are utilized at the table and from that leadership level, how are they engaging in?

281
00:34:13,080 --> 00:34:20,640
How are they being watched? So I put out on the screen a little bit about inhouse versus outsourced h.r.

282
00:34:20,910 --> 00:34:28,050
Rate and you guys mentioned this, i mentioned this in some of your points, but, you know, it's a significant investment.

283
00:34:28,680 --> 00:34:33,870
It will be people who are being trained, certified, sherm certified.

284
00:34:34,230 --> 00:34:40,050
And in that regard, it'll make tasks feel more personal for you.

285
00:34:41,370 --> 00:34:46,379
Because what if your boss does something inappropriate and there is no end until outsource?

286
00:34:46,380 --> 00:34:52,200
Where are you? Are you leaving or are you putting in the resignation rhythms?

287
00:34:53,080 --> 00:35:02,870
Cleaning up was I look like. Can more easily assist with company growth and help businesses remain compliant with local, state and federal laws.

288
00:35:06,180 --> 00:35:12,570
We are very well aware of audits. We are very well aware of what fines and.

289
00:35:14,060 --> 00:35:22,610
Different compliance entities can do to an organization and imagine not having a human resource person on tap.

290
00:35:23,030 --> 00:35:31,840
So one of the things when we. Outsource the transactional components of H.R. in the cancer center practice.

291
00:35:33,280 --> 00:35:47,950
We had a lawyer. We hired a lawyer in he hired a lawyer in an H.R. law to be on call.

292
00:35:49,050 --> 00:35:52,410
And for anything that I needed to mediate. He was on call.

293
00:35:52,470 --> 00:35:55,770
He was right there in the practice with me. Maybe some that was.

294
00:35:56,220 --> 00:36:02,820
So again, are there other other systems that are that are helping you legal system depending on

295
00:36:03,210 --> 00:36:08,370
where we have an entire UGC Office of general counsel here at the University of Michigan.

296
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:13,320
We also have a full on, well invested H.R. department that is functioning,

297
00:36:13,320 --> 00:36:20,220
but we also have some things that we've outsourced that we decided not to do internally at Michigan.

298
00:36:20,820 --> 00:36:26,220
Outsourcing will save you money in time you need to purchase and implement in our system.

299
00:36:26,230 --> 00:36:34,740
What you heard Denise Steagall talk about that was that was usually employees may resent someone from the outside telling them what to do.

300
00:36:35,430 --> 00:36:42,329
And I apologize. Somebody did bring that up, you know, making for certain that it's it's impersonal.

301
00:36:42,330 --> 00:36:47,220
It feels impersonal going forward. So thank you for that conversation.

302
00:36:49,080 --> 00:36:52,830
The way I see each are there are some core competencies.

303
00:36:53,340 --> 00:36:56,700
And whether you outsource or in-source in-house,

304
00:36:56,700 --> 00:37:04,499
in-house or outsource some core competencies you want to continue to have and sustain in your practice,

305
00:37:04,500 --> 00:37:09,600
in your business, things you want to see, things you want to have available to communication, right?

306
00:37:09,750 --> 00:37:13,140
I think earlier on we talked a lot about communicating what that means.

307
00:37:14,580 --> 00:37:22,380
How then will that third party vendor communicate any information of benefit changes or payroll changes or compensation compensation?

308
00:37:24,180 --> 00:37:27,660
Who's going to do. Who's going to give them that guidance?

309
00:37:28,310 --> 00:37:31,440
Will they just know? What's that connection? Was that?

310
00:37:31,440 --> 00:37:35,070
Was that. So you are now the leader. It's going to come from you because you outsource.

311
00:37:35,160 --> 00:37:39,930
So you're constantly doing. Do you have the communications department that you're working with?

312
00:37:40,410 --> 00:37:46,680
Depending on size? What are they doing? Was I look like business.

313
00:37:47,070 --> 00:37:54,030
Business? Understanding Asia teams must have some business insight to understand how our policies contribute to the organization.

314
00:37:55,230 --> 00:38:03,330
I'm the only administrator I know all the policies with with legal law.

315
00:38:03,660 --> 00:38:09,510
Some of them had to be developed on the fly. Some of them have been presence of practice in place.

316
00:38:10,020 --> 00:38:19,170
But imagine yourself as a clinical administrator. If you're in a large organization, you're going to hear about the strategic plan.

317
00:38:19,200 --> 00:38:28,470
You're going to hear about those things. But then if you're not and depending on size, it's you, how are you connected with those leaders?

318
00:38:28,480 --> 00:38:31,530
What does that look like and feeling? Ethics.

319
00:38:31,630 --> 00:38:35,370
H.R. needs to build trust within the organization to be effective.

320
00:38:35,400 --> 00:38:38,700
I take a little I think I want to change the slide to H.R.

321
00:38:38,700 --> 00:38:42,240
Needs to build confidence within the organization to be effective.

322
00:38:42,270 --> 00:38:44,910
Trust and confidence, in my mind, are two different things.

323
00:38:46,170 --> 00:38:55,170
And you want your employees to be confident that no matter where they go and deal with other units or departments within the organization,

324
00:38:55,170 --> 00:39:06,870
they have confidence that that unit has understood the laws by which they need to practice to that employees are going to pay well.

325
00:39:07,380 --> 00:39:13,230
What do they know as each other? Giving them their direction. They're going they're going to use the benefits department.

326
00:39:13,230 --> 00:39:16,620
Has H.R. engaged with. I know they're going to go to quality.

327
00:39:16,920 --> 00:39:22,450
What's. Ethics that someone is being ethical.

328
00:39:25,620 --> 00:39:29,460
Even? Yes. Ethics.

329
00:39:29,820 --> 00:39:33,540
What was crossed with Metro? What do you think was crossed?

330
00:39:34,700 --> 00:39:42,600
Um, well, I mean, I think specifically he was accepting payments for some of the social determinants of health work that he did.

331
00:39:44,370 --> 00:39:51,930
So I think I think that I think the assumption was that that work was not going to be paid for.

332
00:39:53,910 --> 00:39:57,900
I think I don't know that there's a lot of trust that's lost.

333
00:39:57,910 --> 00:40:04,280
There's a lot of like financial stewardship, that's he's supposed to be a good steward for the organization.

334
00:40:04,280 --> 00:40:15,120
And if he's getting 1.1. $9 million bonus when AMA is the minimum wage in his organization is probably like $10 an hour.

335
00:40:15,390 --> 00:40:21,050
It's just. Yeah. What was he at the table fighting for and having each other battle him back?

336
00:40:22,140 --> 00:40:27,990
So he's right. When it's you, it's your voice.

337
00:40:27,990 --> 00:40:32,820
And you heard me say. What is your style? In the beginning, you will have the tools and the science and the data.

338
00:40:33,390 --> 00:40:41,670
What is your style to deliver this change? If you're on behalf of each arm, what is your calling point?

339
00:40:42,150 --> 00:40:47,610
Because you represent part of the system in alignment to keep and help.

340
00:40:47,610 --> 00:40:51,270
Each are doing its functional work.

341
00:40:51,510 --> 00:41:01,420
Literally. It's important to know that human resources has knowledge.

342
00:41:01,660 --> 00:41:03,549
They have enough that they're doing.

343
00:41:03,550 --> 00:41:11,260
And you can see over the course of the class that what they've been trying to do but you can help is what I'm saying.

344
00:41:11,260 --> 00:41:17,680
And for somebody, the way I saw that conversation going when I discovered it.

345
00:41:19,670 --> 00:41:28,280
Was was our process to ring the bell, to make this private meeting with to share this data, the accurate,

346
00:41:28,280 --> 00:41:36,850
truthful data, and coming out of that with an action plan to literally be able to address that.

347
00:41:36,860 --> 00:41:39,860
And if it was outsourced, what does that look like?

348
00:41:40,010 --> 00:41:45,660
They probably would have gone to legal. To be able to help that's going forward.

349
00:41:45,690 --> 00:41:54,860
But so there's knowledge, there's continuous learning. I am sure after that incident, Metro will probably have a new process.

350
00:41:55,460 --> 00:42:04,040
We seem to react to in crisis and changing things and moving things because

351
00:42:04,040 --> 00:42:09,010
they're in crisis hands down because of the culvert work and we were in crisis.

352
00:42:09,020 --> 00:42:14,480
We absolutely changed a lot of our behavior, whether it was H.R. or finance quality.

353
00:42:14,780 --> 00:42:20,780
We changed a lot of things. But that was just because we were in crisis trying to.

354
00:42:22,860 --> 00:42:28,770
It's better when you have time to be thoughtful and can think about things. So there's the planning aspect of what you do and what you're doing.

355
00:42:29,100 --> 00:42:38,130
Try not. I can't tell you how to be and who to be, but what I ask for and in giving advice and think about things in the downtime,

356
00:42:39,510 --> 00:42:44,040
think about things in the downtime versus having to react interests.

357
00:42:46,020 --> 00:42:47,800
So core competencies of HRT.

358
00:42:50,280 --> 00:43:02,069
So what are the areas that I've seen really kind of also help move and motivate each other to being as effective as it can be?

359
00:43:02,070 --> 00:43:05,850
Other systems, human resources, information system.

360
00:43:05,850 --> 00:43:09,720
Again, you heard from Denise SIEGEL looking at the data, looking at the information, looking at what's there,

361
00:43:10,050 --> 00:43:15,750
looking at the staffing and trying to get the story about what will we look like going forward.

362
00:43:15,750 --> 00:43:21,600
Human resource management systems, which I just sort of shared with you before, human capital management,

363
00:43:21,630 --> 00:43:33,120
which we haven't really touched upon in class, but that is really your financial aspect of looking at solutions to help eliminate costs, redundancies.

364
00:43:33,330 --> 00:43:36,270
That's your financial partner coming into play,

365
00:43:36,720 --> 00:43:45,810
helping you take a look at how can you tell the story and take a look at the data that's helping you be a successful you can be today and tomorrow.

366
00:43:46,170 --> 00:43:56,780
Applicant tracking systems. When there's a position posted for my assistant.

367
00:43:57,620 --> 00:44:04,050
I received probably 500 mentions at that time for one AMA.

368
00:44:05,630 --> 00:44:09,740
So how am I? It's if it's you, how are you tracking that?

369
00:44:09,770 --> 00:44:16,879
What does that look like? Are you outsourcing that? Are you looking for a temp staffing service to help you do temp to perm?

370
00:44:16,880 --> 00:44:18,170
Because that is expensive.

371
00:44:18,650 --> 00:44:25,610
Just so you know, when you do the work yourself, what do you do when you're you're being cost effective, but when you've got 500.

372
00:44:26,330 --> 00:44:32,170
So that was probably a process. But I will say that I know I physically had 120.

373
00:44:32,210 --> 00:44:38,220
I think it was like seven or eight applications for an end. And having to go through that.

374
00:44:38,460 --> 00:44:42,480
What's your criteria? What do you do? Who else? Who else should have helped me make that decision?

375
00:44:42,510 --> 00:44:47,040
Who else am I leaning on? What am I leaning on? I got EEOC laws.

376
00:44:47,040 --> 00:44:51,150
I've got all types of. I don't have any kind of legal.

377
00:44:52,760 --> 00:44:56,419
Looking at my friend. You asked my positions what it is. You know, looking at the practice.

378
00:44:56,420 --> 00:45:02,809
What are we doing? What is we need to do? Going from their payroll systems.

379
00:45:02,810 --> 00:45:11,810
Right, and helping each other be as effective. We think about payroll, and I kind of alluded to this a little bit before, too.

380
00:45:12,350 --> 00:45:15,770
You think it's just compensation and benefits, right?

381
00:45:15,890 --> 00:45:19,310
Put in 40 hours a week so that to some.

382
00:45:20,420 --> 00:45:26,300
Place. People are monitoring and looking at that and pay that person on time.

383
00:45:27,140 --> 00:45:38,470
It feels as simple as that. Your employees or you yourself will want to have more questions about your compensation.

384
00:45:39,730 --> 00:45:46,470
What are the deductions? Why are there deductions? You know, how how can I get a loan off of this?

385
00:45:46,480 --> 00:45:49,500
How can I get an advance?

386
00:45:49,510 --> 00:45:55,930
How can I make these changes? You may not be you, but it might be your boys coming to you and asking you these questions.

387
00:45:55,930 --> 00:46:02,320
And if it's you and you've insource, you've got payroll that you can go to as far as your human resources, what does that look like?

388
00:46:02,620 --> 00:46:06,759
Where does that. Where does that request come? 51,000 employees.

389
00:46:06,760 --> 00:46:15,250
We get a ton of requests about. And as you've seen it, can I get paid early and I get paid two days early?

390
00:46:16,090 --> 00:46:19,270
How would it feels? Your employees get paid two days early.

391
00:46:19,840 --> 00:46:23,350
They can show up. They're going to show up. They're going to feel like you care.

392
00:46:24,610 --> 00:46:29,680
So payroll can be more than just the transaction of paying somebody.

393
00:46:29,860 --> 00:46:38,560
It starts to get into the personal human side of what's happening to create a quality, caring culture for your employees.

394
00:46:38,770 --> 00:46:41,139
What do you know? What will you know about payroll?

395
00:46:41,140 --> 00:46:48,520
If you're going into a fellowship opportunity, you know what your salary is going to be and congratulations.

396
00:46:49,270 --> 00:46:53,230
But what else do you need to know?

397
00:46:54,490 --> 00:46:58,960
Learn it because someone's going to ask you as their leader.

398
00:47:00,190 --> 00:47:06,150
Can you explain to me why and how can we have you can send them to a payroll department.

399
00:47:06,160 --> 00:47:12,250
They can do that. But also, what is it that you can do to help the payroll feel more humanistic to them,

400
00:47:12,730 --> 00:47:19,480
sending them to just a website because it's outsourced to be away or sending them

401
00:47:19,480 --> 00:47:27,100
to an Internet where they can do calculations and what have you is great example,

402
00:47:28,050 --> 00:47:40,800
do you think? You are wanting to provide.

403
00:47:42,540 --> 00:47:47,160
Your staff just romped out a beautiful quality improvement program.

404
00:47:48,110 --> 00:47:54,069
You know, want to give a reward to them. Because you're trying to create the right culture.

405
00:47:54,070 --> 00:47:57,620
You're trying to do the right thing. Who does it.

406
00:47:58,040 --> 00:48:04,489
It's going to be 1500. Who's going to do the work to put that into payroll?

407
00:48:04,490 --> 00:48:11,510
Make that happen? Are they going to get 1500 dollars grossed up, you know, 1500 dollars with taxes taken out?

408
00:48:17,720 --> 00:48:26,990
Voices of the staff. True story. President Obama's speech basically stated that was his staff is going to provide 1500 dollars to individuals.

409
00:48:27,530 --> 00:48:35,809
Let me say different. He submitted application. There will be 1500 dollars that we will award to you based on the application and the

410
00:48:35,810 --> 00:48:39,050
development that you would like to do that will come back and benefit the university.

411
00:48:39,380 --> 00:48:42,850
1300 dollars for the individual. $5,000 for a group.

412
00:48:45,020 --> 00:48:53,630
Absolute. It zinged through the employees, absolute zing through the employees, because they're like something for us.

413
00:48:54,050 --> 00:48:58,400
We could do this day, 167 applications.

414
00:48:59,690 --> 00:49:03,260
But the question then became the devil in the details.

415
00:49:03,890 --> 00:49:11,960
You said 1500. How would you feel as an employee that I've said in public communications, 1500 dollars.

416
00:49:12,560 --> 00:49:18,200
And then you realize I'm only getting 15 or.

417
00:49:19,910 --> 00:49:23,989
We got 1500. How how were you going to present these?

418
00:49:23,990 --> 00:49:30,680
These if you're trying to give a reward. These are things you will have to do yourself or rely on someone else to do.

419
00:49:30,890 --> 00:49:34,610
But this is how human resources looks.

420
00:49:35,740 --> 00:49:43,389
To the outside. When you have partners who help try to keep things in alignment with the right culture, we're trying to say we respect our employees.

421
00:49:43,390 --> 00:49:48,610
We care for our employees. We we do these things. But I'm only going to give you 850 when I said 1500.

422
00:49:52,300 --> 00:50:02,320
That's begging the question. So as you heard me sort of trying to convey, I want to make sure I don't have anything.

423
00:50:02,320 --> 00:50:13,980
And yet it's nice that ice cream. Okay so that online guys thank you for persuading the interdependencies.

424
00:50:15,050 --> 00:50:19,850
From the strategic level, you're thinking there's going to be units that will happen.

425
00:50:19,850 --> 00:50:26,330
But from a strategic level, you've heard me talk about the enterprise and that's in its purpose and what it's for.

426
00:50:27,170 --> 00:50:30,920
Then the enterprise sort of informs the business strategy.

427
00:50:30,920 --> 00:50:34,670
The business strategy informs the organizational capability.

428
00:50:35,030 --> 00:50:40,040
Organizational capability supports the design of what you're trying to do.

429
00:50:40,040 --> 00:50:46,900
And if you're designing it right, your management systems. We'll literally give you what you're looking for.

430
00:50:48,240 --> 00:50:51,360
Every system is designed to get exactly what it deserves.

431
00:50:53,570 --> 00:50:58,940
What system are you working in? From an H.R. and leadership perspective.

432
00:50:59,270 --> 00:51:03,229
And so, you know, how well does our business strategy fulfill our enterprise purpose?

433
00:51:03,230 --> 00:51:07,080
Right? How well does organizational capability support our delivery of our business strategy?

434
00:51:07,100 --> 00:51:13,640
I mean, I'm not going to read the words you, but that's their what I wanted to do if this works.

435
00:51:18,470 --> 00:51:24,550
So it's going to be a lot of back and forth if I can do it. I will upload this presentation.

436
00:51:25,600 --> 00:51:30,550
What I was trying to share with you is that we have a new president, President O'Neill.

437
00:51:31,120 --> 00:51:35,350
He is feverishly putting together a strategy of how he wants to lead.

438
00:51:36,280 --> 00:51:40,920
We had previous strategies on the presidential website.

439
00:51:40,930 --> 00:51:47,830
The president, the president's website, office of the president's website tells you about his initiatives and focus.

440
00:51:48,100 --> 00:51:50,229
And so what you have up there is four links.

441
00:51:50,230 --> 00:51:56,890
And the first link tells you about the mission and what we're supposed to be doing here at the University of Michigan.

442
00:51:58,300 --> 00:52:03,220
I will tell you. 11 years ago.

443
00:52:04,060 --> 00:52:07,180
That mission was never on the office of the President's website.

444
00:52:09,430 --> 00:52:14,750
We proved by being the leaders in the best. That was our mission.

445
00:52:16,040 --> 00:52:20,870
Work was completed. Work was put into place, and now there's a mission.

446
00:52:20,960 --> 00:52:24,890
Office of the President. Bless you, Mr. Edu. Again, I'll upload this.

447
00:52:25,310 --> 00:52:27,350
It's up to you if you want to take a look and see what that says.

448
00:52:27,740 --> 00:52:32,510
But what I was getting at is that now that the President has aligned with carbon neutrality,

449
00:52:32,840 --> 00:52:39,260
inclusive history, project D and I and just lots of wonderful things that he will do.

450
00:52:41,100 --> 00:52:45,749
Business and finance is his partner. Business is finance.

451
00:52:45,750 --> 00:52:50,940
Business and finance is what LHR is nestled under. So business and finance.

452
00:52:51,480 --> 00:52:52,830
You've got that link there.

453
00:52:53,220 --> 00:53:01,890
Tells you how they're going to align to the president's mission, the enterprise purpose and their business strategies and what that looks like.

454
00:53:02,550 --> 00:53:13,030
And so when they do that, you are here's the president hears business and finance and says, okay, here is our what we think organizational capability.

455
00:53:13,080 --> 00:53:18,350
Here's our strategic plan. And this is how we're designing it. That's what that looks like.

456
00:53:19,220 --> 00:53:29,070
And then you get a little bit further into the management systems that's going to support that, which somehow that has to get communicated to you.

457
00:53:29,840 --> 00:53:35,120
How was that communicated to you? What does that look like to the employees?

458
00:53:35,570 --> 00:53:44,930
What is the management system that's going to be in place that we're going to train and educate and share with and and go from there?

459
00:53:45,980 --> 00:53:51,230
So I beg the question and I apologize to but MetroHealth,

460
00:53:51,230 --> 00:53:58,670
it's like when you it's easy to go back in hindsight and even with the other 14 CEOs and hindsight and say,

461
00:53:58,970 --> 00:54:07,520
what should we have done differently but proactively, what units and areas were supporting H.R. because.

462
00:54:07,790 --> 00:54:11,870
Is it just words or are we really living this practice?

463
00:54:12,470 --> 00:54:15,410
Is it just a link for Feel Good?

464
00:54:15,860 --> 00:54:25,820
Are we really digging deep and doing our job to call things out, to have the courage to be able to speak the truth and manage something different?

465
00:54:27,020 --> 00:54:28,030
You could have just words.

466
00:54:28,040 --> 00:54:34,820
I am sure when you did your fellowship interviews you probably looked at the mission of that organization and what they're doing.

467
00:54:35,140 --> 00:54:44,480
I also ask that you look at how they're holding themselves accountable to that and who is at the table with H.R. to make sure that that happens.

468
00:54:45,330 --> 00:54:51,520
University, Michigan has internal audits. We do our own internal audits before other audits come into play.

469
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:55,540
We do them on our grants. We do them on our research information.

470
00:54:55,540 --> 00:55:01,670
We do that on. Payroll practices.

471
00:55:02,420 --> 00:55:07,250
We can call our internal audit team to do a number of different things.

472
00:55:07,920 --> 00:55:14,840
I know that we're actually looking across the board as an internal audit of what are we spending,

473
00:55:14,840 --> 00:55:18,560
what are we doing, are we doing it right from a mental health perspective? And h.r.

474
00:55:18,620 --> 00:55:29,040
Is involved with that. Different different practice, different leader, really trying to make certain that our systems are in place to be able to.

475
00:55:31,860 --> 00:55:37,530
To provide and put out what it is we're saying we need to to get quality outcomes.

476
00:55:37,530 --> 00:55:41,070
So the and this is the interdependency at that macro level.

477
00:55:41,850 --> 00:55:57,630
What does this mean for you? Your reality versus your leader's reality.

478
00:56:00,530 --> 00:56:04,700
Positive for something they're going to be working. You're going to be doing some things early on.

479
00:56:06,020 --> 00:56:12,170
How connected are you with your leadership? When I say leadership is multiple people at the table, it's not just your boss.

480
00:56:12,740 --> 00:56:16,080
How connected are you with your leaders?

481
00:56:16,120 --> 00:56:21,740
Business world. You have your reality and what you're trying to provide and what you're trying to put in place.

482
00:56:22,340 --> 00:56:25,190
Where's the common ground? What that what that looks like?

483
00:56:25,190 --> 00:56:32,390
And so on our websites, you'll be able to kind of see the interconnected interconnectedness that was written.

484
00:56:33,320 --> 00:56:38,450
But then what's actually practice? So I'm begging you to get down to what is your reality?

485
00:56:39,650 --> 00:56:43,310
You can you can say one thing and we all know something else can happen.

486
00:56:43,460 --> 00:56:46,700
You can and somebody else will do something else and do another.

487
00:56:47,840 --> 00:56:58,820
I am sure, and I am feeding this dead horse that MetroHealth has the best mission, has the best, you know, they have laid it out.

488
00:56:58,880 --> 00:57:02,300
I am sure that they are trying to be premier and what they do.

489
00:57:03,650 --> 00:57:06,940
Why did they allow in reality practice to happen?

490
00:57:08,560 --> 00:57:14,860
And the same with the other CEOs. There's probably going to be in your world the feeling that you have.

491
00:57:14,860 --> 00:57:19,630
And so how is each our being supported from other places in areas and spaces?

492
00:57:19,810 --> 00:57:25,360
It also depends on you as as future leaders and trying to find your common ground

493
00:57:25,360 --> 00:57:29,520
with what you know about H.R. and your business and the business strategy.

494
00:57:29,530 --> 00:57:38,130
How are you using it? Where's. How are you trying to find common ground?

495
00:57:38,970 --> 00:57:44,130
What does that sound like? What does that look like from the human resources?

496
00:57:44,280 --> 00:57:51,060
Here's an exercise to fight to build common ground. When you go in to your new job after your fellowship.

497
00:57:51,360 --> 00:57:56,879
What? What are the. What are a few big projects? This can either be you or your h.r.

498
00:57:56,880 --> 00:58:05,390
Team is working. Just right off the bat, asking your boss what's.

499
00:58:07,040 --> 00:58:10,460
What's the plan? What's the future look like? What are the things we're going to engage in?

500
00:58:10,820 --> 00:58:14,630
What are the things that I can start working on?

501
00:58:14,870 --> 00:58:21,830
How can I align with that? How is the work of H.R. supporting the focus of your business?

502
00:58:23,810 --> 00:58:29,030
How is the working of what you are doing? Supports the focus of the H.R. business.

503
00:58:30,620 --> 00:58:34,850
What are a few key performance goals your business leader is focused on?

504
00:58:37,390 --> 00:58:45,280
I would be curious to ask all those exiting what they thought their business leader was focusing on.

505
00:58:47,240 --> 00:58:53,180
Did it not align with them any more? Did they have the culture and climate to be able to speak up and speak out?

506
00:58:54,140 --> 00:59:00,130
Was truth able to be told what was being what was literally being codified?

507
00:59:00,230 --> 00:59:02,540
What is the real truth of something?

508
00:59:02,810 --> 00:59:11,810
And I think I said earlier, you're going to have your employees who are trying to do the work and do the work the best that they can.

509
00:59:12,200 --> 00:59:21,080
And a new person you're going to hire, new person coming in. What is that new person going to hear about your area, your work, your employer?

510
00:59:21,830 --> 00:59:26,600
And it's going to be yeah. When we go in the meeting, he's going to talk about quality.

511
00:59:26,630 --> 00:59:30,380
He or she is going to be talking about quality and they'll be talking about this.

512
00:59:31,460 --> 00:59:35,510
Well, let me tell you what we're really focusing on. This is what you really need to do to survive here.

513
00:59:36,080 --> 00:59:39,680
If you really want to know how to make it and you Tammy's been here for 15 years.

514
00:59:39,680 --> 00:59:45,950
That's what she's done. She has connected herself with Dr. So-and-so, and then she has connected herself with leader so-and-so.

515
00:59:45,950 --> 00:59:50,620
And she has played politics. How does each manage that?

516
00:59:51,970 --> 01:00:01,210
How do you manage that? How does how do you feel that you've learned from your leader the business this is?

517
01:00:01,390 --> 01:00:05,080
And then how will you share that for your employees to care? Right.

518
01:00:06,220 --> 01:00:13,090
So again, just doing a little bit of an exercise for yourself when you you do now your fellowship, you know, now when you're in a job.

519
01:00:13,090 --> 01:00:15,940
But begging these questions is going to be important.

520
01:00:15,970 --> 01:00:24,760
So I wanted to sort of give a creating that common ground, connecting the dots type of feel and what that could look like in an organization.

521
01:00:26,770 --> 01:00:32,260
You've got the h.r. Initiatives here on the left side, the workforce priorities and the balance scorecard.

522
01:00:35,310 --> 01:00:38,879
So H.R. initiatives, right? New employer.

523
01:00:38,880 --> 01:00:45,330
Any new employee or new employee onboarding or new employee diversity and inclusion.

524
01:00:45,330 --> 01:00:51,479
H.R. initiatives. This is what, you know, after they've learned the president's mission, what it's going to be and what they're going to be doing.

525
01:00:51,480 --> 01:00:58,500
This is sort of their their initiatives that they would like to align and have management systems that's going to help them in that respect.

526
01:00:59,370 --> 01:01:05,340
An H.R. delivery model, job design, leadership development, professional development of who, what and why, right?

527
01:01:07,170 --> 01:01:09,450
And so the blue are just H.R. initiatives.

528
01:01:09,450 --> 01:01:18,000
But layered on top of that are the workflow priorities, onboarding excellence, living our values, brand promise.

529
01:01:18,330 --> 01:01:21,510
And so that's. Being layered on.

530
01:01:22,590 --> 01:01:26,910
So you work first priorities for external customers. There's internal and external.

531
01:01:27,840 --> 01:01:36,000
You're going to see the employment brand, dignity health brand is leading that dead horse.

532
01:01:37,350 --> 01:01:40,980
Metro Health brand went where after that.

533
01:01:44,740 --> 01:01:48,819
Where did our brand go? And we're not beating up on them.

534
01:01:48,820 --> 01:01:53,350
But where did our brand go with much less where did what happened with that brand with President Obama?

535
01:01:55,450 --> 01:02:04,540
What does that look like? What does that feel like in the balance scorecard is looking at the financial outcomes and the interim ops,

536
01:02:04,900 --> 01:02:11,560
clinical integration, smart growth, quality outcomes. That's sort of what you're on the back end, but your story is.

537
01:02:11,830 --> 01:02:13,450
So there's what the initiatives are,

538
01:02:13,690 --> 01:02:19,629
there's the workforce priorities and that's the balance scorecard from from high above what it is you're trying to achieve.

539
01:02:19,630 --> 01:02:22,720
But what does that mean? What does that look like? What does that feel like?

540
01:02:22,720 --> 01:02:26,740
How are you engaged? Where would you be engaged in any of that?

541
01:02:26,740 --> 01:02:34,400
Are you in any of the balanced scorecard? Are you in any of the balanced scorecard discussions?

542
01:02:35,390 --> 01:02:39,680
Will you be in the job design? Like, what is your role in all that?

543
01:02:39,680 --> 01:02:46,610
Because you are helping the H.R. system move things forward to create the culture for what it is you need in health care.

544
01:02:48,640 --> 01:02:54,630
So. Getting to an example. We're talking about creating a shared understanding.

545
01:02:55,470 --> 01:02:59,940
One of the options you saw was onboarding excellence as a future state.

546
01:03:00,690 --> 01:03:04,350
Right. So there's recruitment. You hire somebody.

547
01:03:05,910 --> 01:03:12,420
Do you just put them on the job? We talked about that, you know, Disney and what they do and a people two weeks before they hit the floor.

548
01:03:13,170 --> 01:03:21,120
But just as a non disease face and in health care the future state is we want new employees feel welcome

549
01:03:21,120 --> 01:03:27,720
supported value managers are actively immersed in our culture and understand the importance of onboarding.

550
01:03:28,050 --> 01:03:32,070
The new employee experience is viewed as strategically important.

551
01:03:32,970 --> 01:03:38,130
How we live, our brand attracts and retains key talent.

552
01:03:38,610 --> 01:03:46,860
Interesting. I look at the University of Michigan and I basically sort of do a comparison about those four bullet points.

553
01:03:47,250 --> 01:03:50,910
I can totally support that. Our brand attracts people.

554
01:03:51,920 --> 01:04:00,830
Folic acid for that. New employees have a onboarding training that they go through where they're getting a ton of information coming at them.

555
01:04:01,070 --> 01:04:08,840
So they come in and then they go to the department and then most of the time they get additional training even for.

556
01:04:11,200 --> 01:04:15,220
Dr. Ernst, who I worked with, moved into his chief health officer role,

557
01:04:15,310 --> 01:04:22,570
and we both agreed that there will be things coming at him that he will need to make decisions on relatively quickly.

558
01:04:23,020 --> 01:04:32,650
But there's some onboarding that he has to do in that role, because people were used to the previous chief health officer and he's somebody new.

559
01:04:32,710 --> 01:04:36,520
And so those relationships have to be built from an onboarding perspective,

560
01:04:36,520 --> 01:04:40,300
even though he's been working here at the University of Michigan for 30 years.

561
01:04:42,890 --> 01:04:47,510
There's some onboarding that he had to go through, and that's to give.

562
01:04:49,080 --> 01:04:55,980
From an H.R. perspective to build the confidence and the trust not only in him, but who he's engaging in for finance for.

563
01:04:56,940 --> 01:05:02,790
Again, just just other areas of I.T., making sure that there's an engagement there.

564
01:05:02,790 --> 01:05:08,010
And he knows the players. He knows what's happening. He's continuing to create the culture going forward.

565
01:05:08,490 --> 01:05:13,290
How does that differ from the current state rate? So I gave you an example.

566
01:05:13,290 --> 01:05:17,460
These are not you of them examples, but just kind of wanted to further out those thoughts.

567
01:05:17,700 --> 01:05:24,689
How does this differ from the current state? Employees may not make a connection with their manager for several days or even weeks.

568
01:05:24,690 --> 01:05:31,079
If you just don't have an onboarding. Welcoming new employees is something that's nice to have.

569
01:05:31,080 --> 01:05:39,060
And when there's time, not a must have or viewed as strategically important other areas to make that decision.

570
01:05:39,360 --> 01:05:42,640
You will be in other areas making that decision.

571
01:05:42,670 --> 01:05:48,899
What is the consequence of doing that, especially if the goal is having a nice onboarding experience?

572
01:05:48,900 --> 01:06:02,660
Do you sacrifice that? So leadership is at the table as leadership is at the table being.

573
01:06:03,830 --> 01:06:11,450
Being engaged, trying to set the master plan of the management systems that they understood the organizational

574
01:06:11,450 --> 01:06:14,900
capability and then get the business strategy that's going to tie to the purpose.

575
01:06:15,350 --> 01:06:23,180
But you yourself as a leader in alignment, try to establish the why behind the organization.

576
01:06:26,030 --> 01:06:31,220
I really think about the why and leaders should be challenged when you're at the table.

577
01:06:31,520 --> 01:06:35,000
You should be begging the why. Why are we doing this? Does this align?

578
01:06:37,250 --> 01:06:41,550
We're doing that work right now in a committee where we're taking our time to understand,

579
01:06:41,630 --> 01:06:48,500
to build our principles, to build our values, because that's what we're going to hold ourselves to.

580
01:06:49,730 --> 01:06:53,240
Being on a committee with like 40 other individuals from across.

581
01:06:53,240 --> 01:07:01,520
We're doing that work right now because if we are going to go out there and tell students, faculty and staff to participate and engage,

582
01:07:02,270 --> 01:07:07,190
what are the values and principles that we are standing on that they can trust and have confidence in?

583
01:07:07,460 --> 01:07:10,560
And we thought about it makes sense. This is a building block.

584
01:07:10,560 --> 01:07:15,290
That's what we're doing. And it's H.R. Plus. It's H.R. Plus.

585
01:07:17,090 --> 01:07:24,139
Define the culture necessary to support the Y. Agree on a shared vision and the results that need to be achieved.

586
01:07:24,140 --> 01:07:29,990
So could be you and a colleague trying to do some sort of improvement.

587
01:07:30,200 --> 01:07:35,240
Did you ask the question? Why did you ask the question up? Why and did you ask the question down why?

588
01:07:35,570 --> 01:07:38,959
But what's your shared vision? If you're working with your other colleagues?

589
01:07:38,960 --> 01:07:43,030
What do you what are you begging from them? Define what success looks like.

590
01:07:44,910 --> 01:07:49,470
You're being asked to put together the company picnic.

591
01:07:49,500 --> 01:07:54,850
What does success look like for that? People just come get their takeaway box and leave.

592
01:07:54,930 --> 01:08:03,300
Or what does success look like for you? Because that helps leaders align with what you're doing and you to align with others.

593
01:08:03,310 --> 01:08:09,000
It's okay to ask your colleagues and coworkers, Why are we doing?

594
01:08:09,690 --> 01:08:14,430
I constantly love doing that with the crooked face.

595
01:08:14,460 --> 01:08:20,250
Why we don't want to be the one I want somebody help me and not understand.

596
01:08:20,580 --> 01:08:29,610
Help me understand. And it's just that exasperation of I hear and respect what's happening, but can you help me?

597
01:08:29,610 --> 01:08:35,040
Because I cannot align. We talk about alignment to a number of leaders.

598
01:08:35,400 --> 01:08:38,580
What have you said to tell that employee? To engage, to align.

599
01:08:38,850 --> 01:08:41,880
It's coming from elsewhere and they're asking you to do it.

600
01:08:43,020 --> 01:08:50,040
H.R. is usually the one trying to get that articulate who is accountable, responsible and informed.

601
01:08:50,040 --> 01:08:54,400
You heard about the race earlier. Other that regular check ins to stay aligned.

602
01:08:54,420 --> 01:09:00,570
What does that status look like? Would have been nice again.

603
01:09:02,460 --> 01:09:08,670
So the medical help for us to understand we did some social determinants of health where

604
01:09:10,020 --> 01:09:16,830
what was stated there and when we put out payments who had a status check on them?

605
01:09:17,370 --> 01:09:22,020
Did anybody check that? And whose responsibility was it?

606
01:09:22,620 --> 01:09:29,250
Do you think his secretary was going to blow the whistle? When his friend at the job was on.

607
01:09:30,370 --> 01:09:33,940
What politics played at the table.

608
01:09:34,450 --> 01:09:37,810
And I'm saying that because, again, our needs help.

609
01:09:38,140 --> 01:09:43,180
It needs supportive places and spaces and data and information and people to.

610
01:09:44,430 --> 01:09:48,420
Keep its churn happening to keep the confidence and the trust there.

611
01:09:50,070 --> 01:09:55,560
Going forward. So sending regular check ins to stay alive, did we did we go off course?

612
01:09:56,310 --> 01:09:59,969
Somebody went off course somewhere.

613
01:09:59,970 --> 01:10:07,900
Some way. How does what do those words look like?

614
01:10:08,590 --> 01:10:11,800
How do you how do you bring that forward? What is your style? Right.

615
01:10:11,830 --> 01:10:21,580
How do you develop? Well, I'm going to recommend that we or this X happens really and really understand that

616
01:10:21,580 --> 01:10:29,380
future state and try to check off the list the gaps that that are occurring.

617
01:10:31,860 --> 01:10:38,040
What that does is it will either curb something that is going down the wrong way and does this quite a bit.

618
01:10:38,760 --> 01:10:44,069
We look at where we currently are with the data, what we have and where we're trying to go and what we're trying to align with,

619
01:10:44,070 --> 01:10:51,690
what other people are saying, what's the gap and how to get there. When you do that determination, you get recommendations for potential next steps.

620
01:10:53,460 --> 01:11:00,720
It is a tool that you can use. Right.

621
01:11:01,710 --> 01:11:07,200
The last like the last 5 minutes before I let you go. The effect of alignment.

622
01:11:07,980 --> 01:11:11,190
Right. Getting higher productivity.

623
01:11:11,670 --> 01:11:16,950
Because people will understand what they're doing and why people want to see what they're doing and why when they are aligned.

624
01:11:17,370 --> 01:11:21,829
Repeating that. I don't know.

625
01:11:21,830 --> 01:11:27,440
And I'd like to ask the question, but have you been involved in something where you're just not even sure why you're doing what you're doing?

626
01:11:27,680 --> 01:11:32,750
You have no idea why we are doing what we're doing and how this is going to make a difference.

627
01:11:35,450 --> 01:11:38,600
And did you beg the question or did you just do the work and just give some?

628
01:11:39,860 --> 01:11:49,579
I know for a fact. And today's class was actually going to be presented by two chief administrative

629
01:11:49,580 --> 01:11:53,989
officers at Michigan Medicine who are my dear friends and if you know them,

630
01:11:53,990 --> 01:11:59,380
Crystal Bates, Andrews and Erin, Leesburg, they were going to they couldn't do it today.

631
01:11:59,390 --> 01:12:09,770
But long story short, talking about how they are bold enough to ask for alignment and what they're doing, getting constant, constant,

632
01:12:09,770 --> 01:12:18,649
constant change, constant, constant change in their daily work and then having to ask the staff how they set up their staff to break barriers,

633
01:12:18,650 --> 01:12:21,410
how they how they are constantly asking for the alignment,

634
01:12:21,410 --> 01:12:29,480
but also getting confidence from H.R. that their job is not on the line because they are begging the questions to leadership.

635
01:12:31,930 --> 01:12:36,400
Feels pretty good when someone's got your back and you're able to question leadership.

636
01:12:38,540 --> 01:12:42,080
How are they reaching out? What does that look like? How does what's the feel like?

637
01:12:42,990 --> 01:12:46,649
You know, you can stay longer in the battle once you know,

638
01:12:46,650 --> 01:12:52,500
you have H.R. and H.R. has other leaders of supporting H.R. at the table so that we are supporting these chief

639
01:12:52,500 --> 01:12:58,080
administrative officers who are trying to do their job to provide equality because they're questioning the alignment.

640
01:12:58,320 --> 01:13:01,940
I mean, it's it's it's pretty pretty connected.

641
01:13:02,580 --> 01:13:12,420
Improved employee retention. I'd say they're going to stay when you have alignment because people know what their purpose is.

642
01:13:14,340 --> 01:13:19,080
Lower turnover. I can assuredly state.

643
01:13:21,120 --> 01:13:26,590
When I came in ten years ago and doing some of the work that I'm doing, I looked at the story.

644
01:13:26,610 --> 01:13:33,059
I call it the story from our data and what was going to be our succession plan, what was going to be our retirement rate,

645
01:13:33,060 --> 01:13:38,310
what was going to be institutional knowledge is going to be walking out this door.

646
01:13:38,850 --> 01:13:45,180
How long do people stay and how long could we have institutional knowledge so that we don't create the same mistakes?

647
01:13:46,110 --> 01:13:53,790
And I knew that the employees at the University of Michigan on average would stay 19 years here.

648
01:13:55,680 --> 01:14:01,260
And it's great. I can personally tell you and her her name is Erica Moravec.

649
01:14:01,530 --> 01:14:06,450
Know I might have shared this before because leaving after 35, 35, 35.

650
01:14:08,710 --> 01:14:14,380
I'm just going to say what, a 2 to 1 match, though. She's doing good, so her retirement looks real.

651
01:14:15,940 --> 01:14:18,220
But she invested in all that.

652
01:14:18,230 --> 01:14:25,260
And one of the things that she said was i really appreciated the relationships I've built and the support and confidence that our h.r.

653
01:14:25,360 --> 01:14:29,530
Department supported when we had a number of hard things to deal with.

654
01:14:30,010 --> 01:14:36,530
Erika has gone through five presidents. And that was her statement to me.

655
01:14:37,160 --> 01:14:38,960
After 35 years, I was like, Wow.

656
01:14:39,530 --> 01:14:50,060
How much you would tell you lowering turnover when you know what it is you're doing and you commit to the end to see it to the end.

657
01:14:50,990 --> 01:15:00,410
So lower turnover and I apologize because I did commit to memory what our turnover rate was ten years ago and I forgot it.

658
01:15:00,410 --> 01:15:07,280
And so now in the latest that my understanding is our turnover rate right now is about 18%.

659
01:15:09,140 --> 01:15:14,350
But seems. Lot of that is people leaving for retirement.

660
01:15:14,530 --> 01:15:21,760
Multiple, multiple ways and reasons and why. But it's about the teams that we have, too, which is pretty low.

661
01:15:22,900 --> 01:15:29,370
Bring. You're in a company of ten, 1.8 people.

662
01:15:30,900 --> 01:15:35,520
You're going to feel it. But you can sustain you can sustain it.

663
01:15:36,270 --> 01:15:41,690
Reduced absenteeism, more creativity and innovation.

664
01:15:41,700 --> 01:15:44,700
When people know what their purposes and they're engaged, they want to.

665
01:15:47,100 --> 01:15:52,950
When you've got the team that's supporting each other and the systems and the methods that are supporting each other.

666
01:15:55,130 --> 01:15:56,330
Those people will stay.

667
01:15:56,330 --> 01:16:06,740
And that is one of the benefits of having that team approach, of having that interdisciplinary approach and a better customer experience in the end.

668
01:16:07,700 --> 01:16:15,320
Health care provides a service. In the end, you are providing a service.

669
01:16:15,890 --> 01:16:21,740
What will your style of service look like? What will your tools and science that you use when you provide that service?

670
01:16:22,160 --> 01:16:30,290
Who will you engage to help with that service? How will you handle yourself as H.R. or using H.R. department to help you?

671
01:16:30,560 --> 01:16:33,980
But don't forget your H.R. partner.

672
01:16:34,520 --> 01:16:38,629
When you go out and be be the leaders, they'll reform.

673
01:16:38,630 --> 01:16:46,760
Because in the end, you want to be seen as someone whose tied in, honest, trustworthy.

674
01:16:47,360 --> 01:16:49,730
Have the courage to do what's necessary.

675
01:16:50,180 --> 01:16:56,930
Make for certain that you are giving the best quality service for the external person that's coming to you for help.

676
01:16:58,130 --> 01:17:03,020
Whether that's the physician, the nurse or the patient for, that's the regents, the federal government.

677
01:17:04,070 --> 01:17:09,980
Challenge who you are, challenge through your systems, be okay with yourself in doing that,

678
01:17:11,090 --> 01:17:18,010
but also ensure that your H.R. department is creating that culture to help you continually create the culture that you need to go for.

679
01:17:18,180 --> 01:17:22,129
So, all right. Next week, I don't believe there's an assignment this week.

680
01:17:22,130 --> 01:17:29,780
So next week will be the senior director of benefits. I want to leave you with H.R., but as you go home, so you'll be here in person.

681
01:17:30,000 --> 01:17:33,380
Name's Brian Watson. And let's see, that's all.

682
01:17:38,570 --> 01:17:42,750
Anybody did not sign the. Down here.

683
01:17:47,710 --> 01:17:52,090
Don't get me wrong.

684
01:17:52,810 --> 01:18:04,930
I know how many points we actually. Basically there was no less I.

685
01:18:06,670 --> 01:18:10,110
Yeah. Yeah. I really like.

686
01:18:11,970 --> 01:18:19,360
I guess. I guess this is where you're going to Colorado.

687
01:18:19,370 --> 01:18:25,840
Yeah. It's like two days. No, it's like, ah, I take one friend for life.

688
01:18:28,370 --> 01:18:32,100
Know, like that's really.

689
01:18:32,650 --> 01:18:37,090
I feel like a growth capital is something bizarre.

690
01:18:38,230 --> 01:18:42,740
So it must be like you're like having a great time.

691
01:18:43,000 --> 01:18:55,150
I think I'm scared because everyone's like, you know, you got to use their money.

692
01:18:56,510 --> 01:19:10,659
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Know, you know, I live in New York City, but I don't even think, you know, it's definitely I would.

693
01:19:10,660 --> 01:19:22,090
You are not ready for almost twice as much in this country every day.

694
01:19:23,980 --> 01:19:33,190
Yeah, that's the thing that spits out closer to me more easily.

695
01:19:33,600 --> 01:19:37,510
Like my soul analyzing to be like.

696
01:19:39,020 --> 01:19:46,030
I just don't know exactly what to look for.

697
01:19:47,060 --> 01:19:57,190
I'm glad to be online. But there's else.
