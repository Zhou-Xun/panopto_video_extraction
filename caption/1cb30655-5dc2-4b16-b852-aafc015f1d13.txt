1
00:00:09,770 --> 00:00:16,700
Moving beyond the federal government. Let's dive deeper into the role that the state government plays in public health,

2
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:23,000
as well as expand more on the relationship that we've been talking about between the federal and state government.

3
00:00:23,900 --> 00:00:31,610
So I think it's a good idea to start first by revisiting where states derive their authority and what authority they're actually granted.

4
00:00:32,180 --> 00:00:35,570
As we discussed in our discussion around the police powers,

5
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:43,640
the Constitution states that powers not delegated specifically by the Constitution nor prohibited by it to the states,

6
00:00:43,910 --> 00:00:47,270
are reserved to the states respectively or to the people.

7
00:00:48,100 --> 00:00:50,060
What does that actually mean in practice?

8
00:00:50,690 --> 00:00:58,640
What it means is that the Constitution gives states authority over safeguarding the health and well-being of their citizens.

9
00:00:59,480 --> 00:01:04,340
So in history, from the mid-19th century until about the 1930s,

10
00:01:04,730 --> 00:01:11,690
states largely exercised that leadership role independently, with really no interference from the federal government.

11
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:19,100
But in the aftermath of the Great Depression and the surge of new federal government programs during the establishment of the New Deal,

12
00:01:19,430 --> 00:01:21,950
federal funding really turned that around,

13
00:01:22,280 --> 00:01:29,240
and the states and the federal government started establishing federal health and human service initiatives like Model Cities,

14
00:01:29,420 --> 00:01:32,960
Community Health Centers and community mental health services.

15
00:01:33,650 --> 00:01:39,800
This created this tension that we keep talking about in the relationship between the state and federal government.

16
00:01:40,490 --> 00:01:45,980
And you can see it play out even more as time moved forward in the 1960s and seventies.

17
00:01:46,160 --> 00:01:51,620
The tension continued to grow as the federal government asserted more control over health care.

18
00:01:52,520 --> 00:01:53,600
As we talked about,

19
00:01:53,750 --> 00:02:02,450
one of the primary examples of the federal government entering the health care system is the establishment of Medicare and Medicaid in 1965.

20
00:02:03,050 --> 00:02:07,250
So when we think about the structure and function of health care and public health,

21
00:02:07,610 --> 00:02:16,340
you can imagine that the federal government entering as a payer directly changed the way that the structures were established.

22
00:02:16,610 --> 00:02:20,690
This placed the federal government directly at the center of health care.

23
00:02:20,930 --> 00:02:27,620
For the first time, our citizens were receiving payment for their medical services from the federal government.

24
00:02:29,130 --> 00:02:35,460
Although states were finding it increasingly difficult to finance public health and medical service programs,

25
00:02:36,030 --> 00:02:42,240
they demanded more and more autonomy and control over the programs that they actually did manage.

26
00:02:42,810 --> 00:02:50,520
At the same time, local governments were making demands on state government to provide more autonomy to them at the local level.

27
00:02:51,400 --> 00:03:00,670
So here we see more tension. And this tension places states uncomfortably in the middle between the two other levels of government.

28
00:03:01,510 --> 00:03:06,940
On the one hand, states are delegated with the authority to protect the health of their citizens.

29
00:03:07,810 --> 00:03:16,750
But on the other hand, they often appear unduly influenced by large active lobbies, politically motivated ones, and are in fact,

30
00:03:17,110 --> 00:03:25,240
one step removed from the resources they need from the federal government to address health needs and the demands of local citizens.

31
00:03:26,170 --> 00:03:33,160
So let's think about what that actually means in practice. Take, for example, the H1N1 pandemic in 2009.

32
00:03:34,110 --> 00:03:36,300
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

33
00:03:36,420 --> 00:03:43,440
A federal agency was tasked with working with states and local health departments to address the needs of citizens.

34
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:44,820
What was the need, though?

35
00:03:45,420 --> 00:03:53,970
Well, it was, as you might imagine, to prevent further spread of the virus and ensure that those who were infected could be treated.

36
00:03:54,630 --> 00:04:02,150
So play that out a little bit. And you can imagine that the state government was placed in a bit of a precarious position here.

37
00:04:02,160 --> 00:04:08,900
The states were tasked with the responsibility to ensure that H1N1 didn't spread throughout their populations,

38
00:04:09,390 --> 00:04:14,210
but they had to rely on federal agencies like the CDC to provide resources,

39
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:19,500
and then they had to rely on local health departments to directly interface with citizens.

40
00:04:19,830 --> 00:04:25,320
So the state was really trapped in the middle. So I want you to imagine then that you're working for the state,

41
00:04:25,650 --> 00:04:31,800
and your responsibility as a public health professional is to ensure that the spread of H1N1 is contained.

42
00:04:32,670 --> 00:04:36,960
So part of your role is to manage that tension between the different players.

43
00:04:37,910 --> 00:04:41,720
And this brings us to an important aspect of a career in public health.

44
00:04:42,260 --> 00:04:50,510
Coalition Building and collaboration. Part of your job as a department employee is to ensure that the proper coalitions are

45
00:04:50,510 --> 00:04:55,460
formed and that you are receiving the resources you need from the federal government,

46
00:04:55,760 --> 00:05:01,010
while also ensuring that outbreak management is taking place properly at the local level.

47
00:05:01,670 --> 00:05:04,070
You might be confronted with all kinds of things.

48
00:05:04,460 --> 00:05:12,650
You might have to address a shortage in flu vaccine or help local government find ways to get access to more flu vaccine in remote areas.

49
00:05:13,250 --> 00:05:16,550
You might even be confronted with something you can't even control,

50
00:05:16,700 --> 00:05:23,510
like a federal government shutdown where funding becomes limited and you need to figure out how to find the resources you need.

51
00:05:24,550 --> 00:05:30,190
So as you can think about all of this and these tensions and the role that the state government plays in the center,

52
00:05:30,460 --> 00:05:37,300
you can see that the state government is playing a really important role in coordinating public health efforts.
